# Chatbot

## Overview
The Chatbot Page project is a web-based chatbot application with a custom UI that displays statistics. The chatbot utilizes two models: a transformers model and a model based on intents files.

## Project Details
The main objective of this project is to create a chatbot page that runs on the web, providing users with an interactive chatbot experience. The chatbot incorporates two different models:

1. Transformers Model: This model leverages the power of transformers to perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It is a pre-trained deep learning model commonly used for text-based tasks.

2. Intents Model: The intents model works with intents files to understand user intents and generate appropriate responses. It analyzes user sentences, detects their intentions, and provides relevant answers.

The project also includes a statistics feature to display relevant chatbot metrics.
