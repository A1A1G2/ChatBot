Hey me, what is your favorite thing in this world?  
Hard choice, I have a lot of things I enjoy. But I love Music, Movies and Videogames. And Llamas! That's how I got my username  
Alpaca better than llama Birb even better  
Hello there! I am a bot raising awareness of Alpacas Here is an Alpaca Fact: Alpaca crias are not usually born later than 2 in the afternoon. This is because in their native habitat, it is key for them to dry off before the cold mountain night starts.  | Info| Code| Feedback| Contribute Fact ###### You don't get a fact, you earn it. If you got this fact then AlpacaBot thinks you deserved it!  
Now listen here you idiot. You don't know what you are talking about, they are both great but Llamas are slightly better ok?!  
Why do you like llamas?  
You seems pretty passionate about llamas. Why don't you ask u/-Llama58- what he thinks of them?  
Llamas are the devil and I stand by my 10 year feud against those satanic murder beasts.  
What music do you like?  
Kill llamas amirite  
What type of llama?  I assume the one that is 58 years old  
How did you came up with the name?  
My name? Interesting question, me. I like Llamas, in my native language, Llama also means Flame which tells I love Llamas and I'm native Spanish 58 is because the numbera resemble my initials, SB. And it's the name I used for my Bandcamp  
How much money have you saved?  
A little, but everything will go down the drain when Cyberpunk comes out  
Ah i see you are excited for cyberpunk too  
Yep yep yep yep  
Is that from archer  
Are you doing this because nobody ever answers your AMA?  
Well, no, but it's true, so also kind of yes  
I didn't understood anything of that  
Here we come r/BestOf and in future r/MuseumOfReddit  
Wow!!! You are so original man!  
Shut the fuck up, I'm you and we both know that's a lie  
Have you both ever had sex?  
I don't want to brag Hey me, do you want to answer that?  
Me anytime I sit down to work on my screenplay  
What‚Äôs it about if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?  
I don‚Äôt mind at all!  It‚Äôs a coming of age story through the eyes of a first generation Hispanic-American woman.  
Hey, let's get political, wanna answer anything about right now?  
Hey me, want to do something later?  
Hehe asexual reproduction  
I friendzoned myself  
YOU FRIENDZONED ME?! :(  
Nah, I'm busy answering AMA from me  
Get a room you two.  
Hey me, what do you hate the most of reddit?  
That train of trend of hating TikTok and Instagram, makes no sense because is hate without bases, just to fit with everyone else  
TikTok IS shit tho. It literally belongs to the Chinese Government.  
And they shadowban my cat tiktoks. Who the fuck shadowbans cute  cats? I wish there was a better App to post super short cat videos on.  
I agree if it's hate without basis but I personally don't like tiktok because of all the fake things on it, stuff that promotes eating disorders and more mental health conditions and I just kinda get annoyed when people are doing weird dances all the time. Oh and everything is overexaggurated like OMG look at this cat so cute omg. Sure there are some good things on it, but personally not for me.  
The reason why I distaste Instagramm is because 95% of the comments are:  üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç  And   üôåüèªüî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üôåüèª  It‚Äôs ridiculous  
Tbh emojis are an easy way to show what you feel without having to put it in words or look too desperate  
Having conversations in emoji is not what I aspire to do.  
Some people joined in the AMA, what are you gonna do  
Absolutely and completely nothing  
Naah that's too much effort  
A mantra to live by  
This guy is fucking smart, look at how much karma he gained from the post and his own comments  
I don't know about that. I did it because I'm clinically bored  
[deleted]  
I want cake  
Actually, I have cake in the oven, want some?  
I want some tooo  
But what kind of cake?  
I want some too!!! Edit: Yay I got some!  
Hey me, where do you live?  
In my home... and yours too...  
r/technicallythetruth  
Hey, I'm hungry, are YOU hungry?  
What happened to the cake?  
Yes, I'm indeed hungry  
But you're not you when you're hungry  
Same. I'm going to have a bacon roll. What will you eat?  
Hey me, why are you doing this?  
I'm very bored  
you live alone?  
It's sad to hear that, I hope it gets better!!  
I hope this AMA blows up.  
I don't! Explosions are lethal, someone could get hurt!  
Hey me, want to play Minecraft?  
I actually do  
You have xbox or playstation? Beta or no beta?  
PC no beta ultra mega hyper cool  
[removed]  
Hey me, how old are you?  
C'mon... you know that  
58?  
I wish, I would be so wise The 58 is because my initials are SB and it looks pretty much like 58  
Being old doesn't mean being wise.  
Any good shows worthy to watch?  
I don't know, I'm you  
Have you been in any fight?  
No... you should know that  
What happened to the first 57 llamas?  
I killed them... I killed them all  
I thought you loved them?  
Not just the men. But the women and children Llama's as well  
This seems like you‚Äôre letting people get to know you, just with some extra steps.  
How do you know that I‚Äôm not you, but from a different universe? Huh, I guess you‚Äôll have to answer me either way.  
I'm answering everyone but the most important questions are MINE!  
Ah, but this IS your question. Since we are one in the same.  
You‚Äôre perfect. Can you pls date me?  
I don't know how to answer that so I will just type a text face :‚Ä¢)  
I WILL TYPE BACK IN CAPS LOCK BECAUSE I WANT TO PARTICIPATE!!! EPIC GUITAR RIFF WAUU-WAUU-WAU-WUAAA-WUUU-WAAA-WUUA-WUUA-WUUAAAA

Why on earth someone does such AMA?  
It's one of the first questions, or well... my first questions  
This is very meta.

Did winamp really wip your ass?  
Literally how are you doing this  
Who are you? Please don't give me your username.  
Hey OP, I'm not going to say that I am you (or that I am not you) but I was wondering if you or anyone in your country plays d&d? (Or any tabletop role-playing games)  
Dude, congratulations for being 100!  I'm 16 (yeah I'm from a very younger generation but I like old, vintage retro stuff, even movies, too) and I appreciate that there's a lot of people turning 100. Sometimes I get jealous of them because they have a long life and they have a life before digital/internet stuff while I'm stuck here with digital stuff. I guess I'm born in the wrong generation.  Anyways, I have some questions... 1) Do you have a cell phone? I wonder if 100 year old people uses a cell phone like a smartphone or a flip phone.  2) What did you do as a little kid?  3) Have you seen classic movies like Casablanca, Jaws, Back to the Future, The Matrix and The Phantom of the Opera (1925 with Lon Chaney)?  4) What advice would you give to younger generations, even generations that came after you died?  5) How would you react to modern technology? 6) It might sound stupid but what's your opinion on LGBTQ? 7) Have you watched TV? 8) Have you seen old silent movies, especially with Chaplin, Chaney, etc. both as a kid and as a adult/elder?  9) What kind of music do you like? Country music? Rock? Rockabilly? Blues? You ever listened to Elvis, Tom Petty, The Blue Brothers, etc?  10 What's life in 1920s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s?  11) I bet you knew what's Netflix is. They had a lots of good shows that you're missing out on. I recommend watching "NCIS". It's good.  12) What's your favorite movie?  13) Tell us your favorite story about your wife and/or your family or anything else. I want to listen to these elderly people's stories before they vanished from life.  14) Do you enjoy books? Have you read Fahrenheit 451? What's your favorite book?  15) How are you holding up now in this global pandemic?  16) Where do you live? USA? England? Australia? or something? 17) Have you served in the military? What military branch you're in? What war do you fought in? WWII? Korean War?  Sorry if I have too many questions but I'm impressed that people lived a very long life. It's would be a shame that I never got to hear their opinions and their beautiful stories when they're gone. Enjoy your day, my man! Stay safe! Best wishes! -RayKVega  
1.I do have a cellphone! I got an iPhone for my birthday! 2.My Dad owned a farm,I would usually help out there 3.Yes I have! Back to The Future II is my favorite movie! 4.Give your parents a hug every day you live with them 5.Its a bit confusing but my grandkids help me with it! 6.I have never heard about it,what is it? 7.I still do! 8.A few 9.I listen to a whole lot of John Denver,Nirvana and the Beatles 10.Fast,that‚Äôs for sure! 11.Yup! I have my own account 12.Back To the Future 2 13.My happiest memory with my wife was when we had our first born child. After hours,she finally went to sleep,and we slow danced for an hour until we went to bes 14.I have never read Fahrenheit 14,but I love reading about history and my favorite book is The Hitch-hikers guide to the Galaxy 15.I miss some of the guys at the pub,that‚Äôs about it though. 16.I was born in England and moved to the U.S with my wife 17.I was a mechanic with the British in Word War II Thank you for the questions!  
The LGBTQ community is for people who love the same sex as they were born (Gay/Lesbian) , people who don‚Äôt identify with the gender they were assigned at birth(Transgender), people who love both the gender they‚Äôve been assigned and the opposite gender, and many more! But to sum it all up it‚Äôs basically for people who aren‚Äôt completely cis and heterosexual. I know it can be a little confusing at first but I do hope that it makes some sense!  
Thank you for your service in the war sir.  
What was the one of the best decision you've made in your life that you still enjoy today?  
Choosing to have children. I was skeptical about it at first but my wife and a few friends eventually convinced me. Best decision of my life  
[deleted]  
Because we are still living happily together,and I have beautiful children and grandchildren because of it  
When Gramps say their children / grandchildren are beautiful they always secretly hold on the "It couldn't be otherwise, coming from a Casanova like me!" and I like that.  
My mother told me that grandchildren are your reward for not killing your children.    My Mother!  
Being 100 how old are your grandchildren and are there any great grandchildren on the way?  
 but my wife and a few friends  You're saying if I held off a bit longer my wife would have got a few friends involved in the child making?  
Haha no,my wife is a very loyal woman. She never would have even thought of that!  
Your own fault for not bringing up the idea yourself then. I jest. Happy centennial.  
Damn, that hits home. I‚Äôm 33 and still deciding. I always thought I wanted kids until my last relationship didn‚Äôt work out. I love my nieces and nephews so so much, but I just don‚Äôt feel responsible enough to have my own. It‚Äôs a real struggle right now.  
I‚Äôm 36 with a 17 month old. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd get the chance. Never say never.  
Assuming you are a dude too? Had my son at 33, honestly was having a hard time thinking about kids and the permanent changes they bring before that. Been with my gf for 14 years before but something just clicked, inside me, and i thought I'll  never know if I can or will be a father unless i try. Boom, pregnant on the first try, nothing much discussed before except I knew she wanted kids and was basically just waiting around for me to decide I guess. Now.. we've been lucky, I cant tell you how lucky, and its been easy and great but hes almost 3 now and personality is starting to show, a lot. You have no idea how little you know who you are until you see it reproduced right in front of you by a being a tenth of your age with half your genes. Good luck either way you decide!  
I‚Äôm a father of two (4 y.o. and a 1 y.o.) and your comment gave me hope because lately it‚Äôs been getting rougher physically and mentally to the point of making me doubt it was a good decision. I love them to death but it‚Äôs been really hard.  
OP look at the question, wants to say something else, sees his grandson sitting next to him, and decides to make his day  
What are some regrets you have? Or mistakes you made that you want the future generations to learn from?  
Give your parents a hug every morning for as long as you live with them  
Thanks a lot. This is actually something a lot of people stop doing when they think they've "grown up". I need to do this more  
Idk why but this almost made me tear  
What law are you going to break next year?  
My grand-daughter wants to do an april fools prank on her Mom next year where we but soy sauce in a bottle of Coca Cola  
I googled and I love it.  Next question, I work as a therapist in an assisted living center.  I love my residents and always try to make their day happier by engaging with all of them.  Do you have any suggestions on making their lives as happy as can be in the time of Covid and no visitors?  
Ask if they want to do a vide chat with their grandchildren or something of the sort. Atleast in my experience,grandchildren are the brightest joy anyone can have  
So you are saying that my parents love my son more than me heehee (and yes great idea!)  
That is so sweet. I'm not a grandma yet, my daughter is only five. But I can see how much joy my daughter and nephews bring to my mom. I think it's because you don't have the awesomely terrifying responsibility of raising them. You can just enjoy them, love on them, and spoil them.  
You should do an AMA. I bet many people would have plenty of questions about working with the elderly and I bet you have many fun stories to tell :))  
Ok I have to go google that, I‚Äôve never heard of it  
How does it feel to be 100 years young?  And if you were 25 again, and had the chance to travel the country/world OR work at a desk job, what would you choose and why?  
Travel the country because I hate desk jobs  
I‚Äôm the same way, ha. ALSO, how would one get to be 100?  
Just keep waking up! That's my plan and I think it'll work  
ah yes, what great advice. I shall live to 1000 years with this advice thank you kind sir  
Happy Birthday Sir!!! Have you broken the law before or is this your first time?  
Haha,I tried weed one time and stole a candy bar when I was 13  
Did you steal the candy bar after you tried the weed? Happy birthday, friend! Also, was this your first time playing with lego? Thanks for being awesome!  
Haha no,I was 80 at the time  
I love that you tried weed when you were 80! Sounds like it wasn't your cup of tea? I like putting legos together better when I'm high ;)  
That's hilarious (maybe he wanted candy due to the effects of the weed).  
How did the weed go?  
Probably not good if he only tried it one time.  
Trueeeeee  
Awh you're precious!üíû happy birthday!  
Rock n roll brother!  
How is your day today? What's the coolest thing that you've done or that's happened to you?  
The coolest thing I have done was kiss my wife on the top of the Eiffel Tower  
That's awesome!  
Also, happy birthday!  
That‚Äôs awesome! What did you build?  
I built this little bike and other thing whoch I dont know what to call.And got some little guys.  
‚ÄúLittle guys‚Äù is the best thing we have all ever heard and nobody can convince me otherwise  
I will never refer to them as minifigures ever again.  
language  
My b  
"Got some little guys" just won 2020. Thank you for being the best grandpa and an awesome dude.‚ù§  
My dad calls them little guys too ü•∫  
‚ÄúLittle guys‚Äù. Can someone make this a shirt with the Lego people under it?  
This is so pure. I love my little guys  
I want that shirt  
I would also buy this shirt! I say little guys for toys all the time, especially the lego guys! (I work with tiny humans, for context)  
Are you still alive and now 101?  
What would/wouldn't you recommend everyone to do in their lives?  
Never talk to someone that makes you feel as if you need to change something about yourself  
I think I do that to other people. I need to change this about myself.  
The rules are you can‚Äôt talk to yourself then.  
What advise do you have for younger generations for instance I want to be a cop and I saw you said you fought in a war any tips on that or any life tips that have helped you so far and also did you your kids or grandkids have nuclear bomb drills in the Cold War sorry if this is too many questions I‚Äôm just very curious  
I know my daughter had some nuclear bomb drills back then. My biggest advice is to go into every day with a smile. It helps you enjoy your job more. I never worked a day in my life thanks to this  
Thank you for sharing this god bless you with good health  
Was the LEGO set ok on your hands? Those are horrible to step on but being the age you are, and I mean no offense you‚Äôre awesome, was it ok pushing the bricks together?  
Yes haha. Didn‚Äôt hurt at all  
I‚Äôm glad you had fun! You have an amazing birthday!  
What other badass things did you do over the years?  
I bought a Camaro in the 70‚Äôs. My wife and I used to drive down the highway,blasting music,with the engine loud as hell  
Oh hell yeah. Happy birthday!  
Why would you break the age rules sir.  
I have broken many age rules. I stole some of my Dad‚Äôs beer and drank some when I was 10  
So the key to living to 100 is drinking beer starting at age 10  
Yes, precisely.  
Instructions unclear. Drank vodka  
And Legos at 100!  
Anyway happy birthday  
If this is true, not only was this underage drinking, but this was also during the Prohibition. Lol.  
Maybe he isn't from America Edit: Aperently he is British  
No questions, I just wanted to wish you a Happy Birthday because you have the best birthday in the world! (I turned 33 today.)  
Happy birthday to you too!  
Happy birthday to you two!  
Happy birthday!  
What advice would you give to teenagers today?  
Listen to what they teach you in school,it may not seen useful at the moment,but it will be later  
Here‚Äôs hoping I get to use calculus as a lawyer lol. I‚Äôll take your word for it. Things seem to work out in the weirdest ways. Happy birthday sir!  
Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell  
Any advise for other generations?  
You can always leave a situation you don‚Äôt feel comfortable with. No matter when or where  
Thanks for this, dealing with the aftermath of a bad relationship with a child in the mix  
What has been the most stunning change in technology you have witnessed?  
Cars. Definately cars  
What do you think about car designs? Do you think they were cooler in your youth or are they cooler now?  
Happy birthday!!!! üéâüéâFavorite historical event you lived through?  
The moon landing  
Maybe you will be there for the mars landing...  
Elon better hurry up now  
I hope Brian won't need Elon to hurry up for to see it  
How has COVID impacted you?  
My local pub is closed,I miss all the guys there :(  
The fact a 100 year old guy just goes down the pub for a pint really cracks me up for some reason  
That brings hopes :b  
Legend!  
What is your favorite memory?  
When I married my wife in 1960!  
You were 40? And still married 60 years later? Congratulations!  
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with getting married at 40. My dad married my mum when he was 49 and my mum was 37 (my parents were a little older having children)  
This gives me hope. Thank you very much.  
What set is it?  
It‚Äôs the new Star Wars one,my son says it‚Äôs called the 501st battlepack  
Looks sick, congrats  
When do you expect the police to come in to arrest you, sir?  
I hear them outside already  
Use the spare legos as traps. Worked for me atleast  
How long did it take you??  
About an hour haha.  
About 100 years  
Has your grandfather been to war?  
Nope,but I have!  
I‚Äôm sorry to hear that happen you didn‚Äôt get many injuries  
Nothing war related actually! I did drop something heavy(I cant remember what) on my pinky toe so I had to have it amputated  
OW sorry to hear it  
Thank you for your service, which one?  
World War Two. I was a mechanic for the British Military  
Thank you for your service! We got deliberated by the British on D-day (if i got my history right). If i may ask, what was your experience like? I get it if you don't want to answer, i'm just somewhat interested in World War Two.

This is so wholesome, what did you make?  
The new Star Wars kit

What country are you from?  
Happy birthday! I‚Äôm impressed by your energy and would love to be like that when I‚Äôm 100 myself.  My question: having lived the life you have, what would you tell your 30-year old self today?  
No questions, just glad you have found something that lets you express your creativity. That said, photos or a description of your creation would be nice.  
Did you just ‚Äúpics or it didn‚Äôt happen‚Äù a 100 year old?  
Has the advancement of technology blown your mind or genuinely surprised you how far its come, did you ever think tech like we have now would be possible?  
Just wanted to say one of the fondest memories that I had with my grandpa was building an AC remote controlled car. He was 94. I‚Äôm glad you had this opportunity with your son to build a lego set. I‚Äôm a grown man and writing this kinda brought a tear to my eye. May the force be with you!  
How does it feel to be such a criminal mastermind?  
Impossible, lego said only age 6-99 for LEGO congrats you just broke LEGO ,

Hi Brian, I hope you had a great birthday! This may sound silly, but I‚Äôm blown away by the fact that your grandparents and possibly your parents were born and grew up in the 19th century! Do you remember any stories that they told you about when they were young and what life was like? Also, I saw above that you served in WWII, thank you for your service and you are awesome!  
We could use a man like you in the 501st  
What do you miss most about being your grandsons age?  
Happy Birthday!!!  What music do you like?  How has your taste in music changed?  What are your thoughts about types of music that you liked at a younger age making a comeback?  IE swing music and other genres.  Thank you and your grandson for doing this!!  
If you live to 100, I say you get to make your own rules.  
Congratulations my grandmother would have turned 100 this year too but she didn't quite make, she died last December so I will have a little party vicariously for the two of you.  
Brian, I hope you are still going strong and breaking the age rules!  
What an absolute chad. How difficult is it to wield this power?  
What was it like when you were a teen?  Also nice work on the LEGO build  
Wondering if Brian still around ü§î  
What are your thoughts on music from your teen years, music from the 70's and music from today?  
Hey Brian you still kicking?  
What's your deepest regret?  
Hi! young'n here, and have you always liked lego?   (if yes, whats your most favourite set?)  
He says above that this was his first set.  
Do you still get perks from the cruise or are you contained your your room? Like can you still go out and get drinks or is the whole place shut down  
I‚Äôm so sorry that you are stuck there. How are you feeling now? How bad did your symptoms get? When will you have the results of your test back? Rooting for you!!  
Is the situation be handled well or is it a chaos?  
I live in Japan. Your cruise ship. The coronavirus. This is big news here.  Japan has the highest infestation of the virus right now of any country outside of China.  Why? Because prior to this Chinese tourists came here by the hundreds of thousands? Millions?  They are all gone. I walked around my city today and heard and saw two Chinese people. They must live here. The Chinese tourists in all the places I normally see them at are gone. It‚Äôs like a bad scene out of the body snatchers. Like poof. Vanished. And trust me there would be like a hundred or more at my nearest Starbucks. Bic Camera. None. To the OP cheering you on. Hang in there. I hope the consulate or embassy is aware of your presence.  Japan is a great country. Gorgeous. With great people and food. Safest place I‚Äôve ever lived too. Honest people who will go out of their way to return a lost wallet or phone or cancel what they were doing to personally walk a lost tourist to their destination. Hope you can come back someday. You‚Äôll love it.  
Do you have any idea about how long they'll keep confining you to your rooms? Are there people on board who are infected? This must be horrifying to experience, best of luck to you!  
How long was the initial cruise supposed to last? What are you doing to not be bored?  
Our news station says 20 cases tested positive on the ship. Are you aware of this?  
What time is breakfast,lunch and dinner if each meal takes 3 hours to deliver to everyone? Do you get to choose meals or is it just whatever you‚Äôre given?  
Any idea how the cruise line will reimburse you for this adventure of a lifetime? Maybe they‚Äôll charge you for the extended stay?  
How do you get food and drinks if you‚Äôre not allowed out of your room? Do they bring it to you?   This sounds awful, especially since it was supposed to be a great vacation.  
So the ship originated in China or somewhere else affected?  
Oh my gosh, I feel your pain.   Are they letting you have free internet?     What are you meals like?   Are they giving you unlimited water?  Other drinks?   What about paper products?   How is the staff treating you?  How is the staff being treated?  
What part of the USA are you from? How long were you planning this cruise for? How do you boil water in your rooms? What‚Äôs the food like? Do they deliver it and then you leave it outside your room? Are you able to shower with water restrictions?  I recommend getting on tiktok and learning the dances if your bored! You could get a good following on tiktok with that!  
What kind of room are you in?  Are they preventing people from going on their balconys?  
How did you and your wife meet?  
How big is your cabin? Are you doing okay staying occupied with things to do?  
You said you have a balcony with your room. Are you able to go out on it or is that locked and not allowed?  
Your best man here! Your ass better make it back to me safely in one piece! Your wife can come too I guess. But for real bro, glad to see you guys are ok!!! If you need anything done here on the home front let me and Lil Bit know for real bro, we got you! Love you both and keeping y‚Äôall on our prayers!  
These are my grandparents. https://ibb.co/p3284vs Their names are Dave and Terri. I know it's hard to identify anyone with the masks on, but he will almost always be wearing that hat and a Texans jacket and she will almost always be wearing a nude beanie and a blue jacket. If you see them during deck time, please say hello and tell them their only granddaughter loves them.  
Did they make the internet free? Do you have an international plan? How are you connected right now?  
The man has a handfullofkeys, but no way of getting out of his cabin.  
I work for another major cruise line shore side, and I'm sorry you're experiencing such a difficult thing. This outbreak is terrible in many ways, and for this industry it's proving more impactful than hurricanes are. That being said, I hope things improve for you all onboard and thank you for sharing what's going on!  
How's the food?  
I've sailed a few times on princess and always really liked it, so I hope they do the right things and really comp you big time for this, even though it isn't really their fault specifically. Are they giving everyone free WiFi?  
Is there anything that we (we, meaning the collective reddit) can do to help you?  
How's the weather? Stay safe man, hope everything works out.  
How are the staff faring?  
Are you scared of contracting the virus?  
How long was the trip supposed to be?  To keep busy you could try playing role playing games online with friends. Assuming you have access to something like Discord or Zoom. If you‚Äôve never played before and want to learn a little you could watch some Critical Role. You have a lot of time to fill.  Dungeons and Dragons could help with the cabin fever.  Good Luck.  
1: will you be reimbursed for having to stay in your room 2: did you see/interact with anyone who seemed like they had symptoms  
Update on my end: Grandparents continue to be in the best spirits possible... with spirits. Found out they are able to get liquor, so that is helping them. Their sailing friend (he's known as Santa Claus to most of his friends and family) has tested positive and removed from the ship yesterday. His wife has been told it's probably only a matter of time for her. Keeping you in my thoughts and prayers. Much support from Houston.  
Can you hear the sex? I bet babies are being made.  
What precautions have the ship been doing before the quarantine, because I think the virus already broke out before the ship left the first port(?) I know they usually have wash basins or sanitizers at the buffet section, but did they have the crew serve you the buffet or ban them and made everyone eat in the dinning room? What would be your tips to someone who has booked a Princess cruise in a few months (thank goodness it is just USA, but it's still the west coast)?  
If you want more responses, cross post this in /r/iama which is a much bigger subreddit.  
[deleted]  
Awesome news about the crew getting PTO.  I'm would think every one of them would take it.  It seems the cruise line is really trying to go above board to make things right.  It is quite refreshing to hear as normally companies try to find ways out of problems and defer blame on anyone but themselves to cut costs and save money or corporate bonuses.   ‚Äã Glad to hear the food is getting better too.  You see to be eating quite well over there.  Any allergies that you have to be careful about (for your wife or yourself)?   ‚Äã Do you have a calendar where you are counting down day by day until the 14 days are up?   ‚Äã Thanks for all the replies.  It's good to hear you are staying so positive.   In the interviews you are doing, are they asking you the same questions a lot or are you getting pretty good, new questions every time?  ‚Äã Okay.  Looking forward to the next update.  
Fellow Dallas Nurse here and local living in Euless! My husband and I have been following your post for updates daily. I know you probably have plenty of people available but wanted to offer anyways just in case. If you need any local errands or tasks to be done we would be glad to help!! Seriously it wouldn't be any inconvenience. If you think of ANYTHING let us know.  
Man, that‚Äôs awful luck. What are you doing to pass the time? Are there going to be any repercussions for missing work?  
This is super interesting to read almost 2 years later  
How bored are you?  
We feel your pain, well,....kind of....we are currently on a Holland America cruise (the Volendam) somewhere off the coast of Taiwan.  We were at some of the same ports of call that you visited .  Pretty sure we saw your ship. Which means we were in port with many of the passengers on your ship .  üò≥So far they tell us we have no known cases onboard but we have not been let into any port for 3 days.  We were turned away from scheduled ports in Taiwan the Philippines and Japan.  We are now waiting to hear where we can dock and hopefully disembark..... if they let us!  Our cruise line has agreed to 100% refund for this trip AND 50% off a future cruise (hopefully you can use this info to demand the same from Princess). Good luck! I imagine a health screening will be in our future and hopefully we can skip the quarantine.  Your advice has got me thinking.  I‚Äôm stocking up on bottled water!  And wow, SO HAPPY we have a balcony.  Best of luck  
If you get told that your test was negative, can you leave your cabin?  
Could you please tell your wife just how stinkin' CUTE it is that she's passing time by planning strangers' birthday parties 'n shit? That's ADORABLE.  
Two questions: 1.  As a nurse, do you think you‚Äôll be subject to additional screening/testing before you are allowed to return to work?  I know you‚Äôll be free to travel when released but, given your job, do you think extra precautions will or should be taken?   As a result of this experience, what is something new that you‚Äôve learned about yourself or your SO?  Arigato and stay safe. PS: Love the daily updates!  
I‚Äôm crying over that care package. What an incredibly nice human!! A whole DS!!!!! Thanks for your updates and positivity OP! It‚Äôs been an interesting read and honestly a lesson for me on how to be a little less cynical. Prayers for your continued health and safety and I‚Äôm so excited for your reunion with your pupperoni!!!  
So with the additional cases taken off today, it seems like the containment/quarantine isn‚Äôt working? An additional 2% of people‚Äôs getting sick each day is unsettling at best.  
I‚Äôve been following along the past few days since you posted on r/cruise. You‚Äôve had such a positive attitude and I really enjoy the updates!  From what I‚Äôve gathered this was your honeymoon together? Congrats on your marriage! It doesn‚Äôt seem like this is your first cruise, but was this your first Princess cruise? We are headed on Royal Caribbean cruise in the Caribbean for our honeymoon in June. We‚Äôve only sailed RC.  
you good?  
OP - you mentioned in a comment somewhere that that you can only get Japanese Netflix and so there are only Japanese shows.  I live in Japan and I can tell you that there are A LOT of English language TV shows and movies on Japanese Netflix.  The titles are in Japanese which is probably throwing you off, but there is always the option to choose the English soundtrack for English shows and there are often English subtitles (and sometimes) dubs for Japanese shows.  You may have already figured that out, but feel free to ask any questions you have:)  
Your ship's captain sounds like a pro and doing a great job in the face of a difficult time. Hopefully you guys will be able to give him a performance review after this is over so that he can get a pay raise or something.  
I enjoy your updates as they are informative yet delightfully pithy in the best way.  There is no extraneous detail but enough to bring us up to date with your situation and the current updates of the day..   I hope when they make the movie (which how can they not), you get played by some really good actors.   Regarding all the rice you are eating, is it just rice, or is it stuff on rice?  More Asian style?   I have a curious question, if you knew you would be quarantined before you were quarantined, what sundries or items would you have stocked up on beforehand to make your current situation better?  What do you miss most?   You said you were from Texas - what is the 1st meal you are going to have once you get back to the USA/Texas?   Thanks for your post.  Look forward to tomorrow's update!  
I'm glad it's the two of you in the room. A single person confined to a room could be a nightmare in this situation! For that matter, having an active toddler is a catchy situation as well. Do you know if there are any toddlers or babies onboard? I don't know how they will manage!  
What is the current ranch situation?  
Just a question regarding your last update..is corona beer for sale or has it been cut from the bar?  
Hello! I‚Äôve been checking in on you guys each morning and am enjoying your updates. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre doing so well in what must be a really anxiety-provoking time. Hang in there - you‚Äôre doing great! You seem super positive and have really answered a lot of the less thoughtful questions with kindness and humor. I don‚Äôt think I could be so patient. Do you have a secret for how you manage to stay so upbeat?  
Looks like they are starting to let some of the passengers off the ship,  starting with those over 80.  https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200213_25/  
Good morning! How are you doing today? I'm a Chinese reporter from a news website called Jiemian and would like to know more about your current situation. Have you heard any new notice fom the crew, embassy, the governemnt...on Friday? Is there any new plan to test others? What's your arrangement for today?  How are your neighbors doing btw? Thank you.  
Shootout to the ship‚Äôs crew...! Delivering room service to 1500 staterooms is HUGE and totally different from normal operations, even under a much less difficult hygiene / public health situation.  
The Japanese above the phone number they're holding up on your update from 11:00 today says "Fuji Television", which is one of Japan's biggest TV stations  
Journal it all! Even if it‚Äôs just in ‚Äúnotes‚Äù on your phones. Take care of each other, stay safe and remember she‚Äôs always right üòâ‚ù§Ô∏è  
I get thay they are trying to prevent the spread of an epidemy but isn't forcefully holding you in your cabin, barely Giving you water and food and not telling you the results of your tests illegal? I believe that locking you up and not properly feeding you is a violation of at least one of the human rights treaty.  
OH MAN, TAKE CARE BROTHER! HOW MUCH DO YOU BENCH PRESS?! DO THEY HAVE A GYM ON BOARD?! YOU SHOULD CONVINCE THE GUARDS TO LET YOU USE IT, SO YOU CAN GET PUMPED AND BEAT THE VIRUS ASS! YEAH! YEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!  
I have been following you since the beginning and now I'm proud to know you and consider you both as my Reddit friends.  You and your wife are the very definitions of grace under pressure. I would be far less cool and collected and confident than you have been. I admire you both greatly. Wishing you well!  
Are you getting your meals everyday from the same cabin attendant? Are the Spa/Casino/Entertainment/Shop Attendants and other crew other than food and beverage helping with delivering food?  Hang in there! Love the posts. Tell the crew we're thinking of them too.  
if the crew is coming to speak with each individual passenger, aren‚Äôt they going to inadvertently spread the disease if they come in contact with an infected passenger?  
What is the first thing you‚Äôre gonna eat when you get back to TX?  
Are you started to become more worried as now 61 people are reported to have come back positive ? That‚Äôs tripled in a day  
For fuck sakes people. Read OP‚Äôs answers before saturating this thread with questions they‚Äôve already answered several times. There are such things as stupid questions. OP has already answered: questions on type of food being served, the food schedule, how many days they‚Äôve been on board, what they are doing to pass the time, whether or not they are personally ill and how they are feeling (they have not been given their status officially). Additionally, what‚Äôs going on with their job back home, whether or not they will be reimbursed by the cruise company etc... It‚Äôs Reddit. Read.  
I just wanted to say that I come back to this post multiple times a day for updates. Thank you so much for keeping us informed!! I hope that you keep updating, even if questions have slowed down. Wishing you and your wife the best!!  
If you ever get a chance watch the cruise ship episode   of Mega Food on Netflix. It gave me a whole new appreciation for the chefs on cruise ships. I know it's probably not possible, but a crew documentary of this experience would be amazing.  I can only imagine how hard it is to juggle everything when this was not the cruise plan. Keep up the updates OP, I check to see how you are doing each morning. Keep making those book plans. It's sure to be a best seller!  
With this latest update - do you know  preliminary what you might choose - shoreside facility or stay onboard?   It seems like the shoreside facility might separate passengers into individual rooms but I'm sure remaining longer on the ship than you have to is the last thing you want to do.   Hope you two have a good day! Trying to share whatever I can find as well.  The latest update from PC regarding the quarantine procedure:   ‚ÄúPrincess Cruises has been informed that over the next several days, Japanese health officials are planning a voluntary disembarkation of guests to complete their quarantine period at a shoreside facility,‚Äù the cruise line wrote in an update on its website. ‚ÄúFrom the information available it is our understanding that this will be a phased approach, with the most medically vulnerable guests in the first phase, including older adults with pre-existing health conditions.‚Äù Once screened, guests who test positive will be transported to local hospitals. Those who test negative will be given the option of relocating to a shoreside facility, with individual rooms and bathrooms, for the final stages of quarantine. Guests are ‚Äúalso welcome to stay" on the Diamond Princess, if they so choose.  
What you‚Äôre going through right now is probably more difficult than what many couples face in years of marriage! So at least y‚Äôall‚Äôve gotten that out of the way.  What day were y‚Äôall supposed to come back to the states? What do your jobs think about all this? Have they told y‚Äôall anything about how the patients with the virus are doing? Did you know anyone that has tested positive so far?  
Did you guys notice anything atypical about the cruise, before you heard about the virus and were given the questionnaires/got tested and all that? Did you at all notice that people on board were sick?  
If you perfectly circumvented being sick in Asia, are you not concerned about having to fight the same battle twice once your in the states and it gets to a pandemic level?  Do you wish you just got infected now so your already building up antibodies for this strain?  
How are you dealing with expendable products (shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste etc) ? Does the ship provide them for free? Keep fighting!  
You said you‚Äôve been watching a lot of movies, any good ones?  
wow, just watched a japanese news clip on youtube( https://youtu.be/c2P6zyu7lOk ), saying that an additional 39 were tested positive, dunno if it's the same what you wrote at 9:37, amongst the 39, 29 were passengers, 10 were crew members, and one of them is a girl just 10+ years old, which is the first 10+ year old case in japan, also a male medical personnel doing the conoravirus tests was infected too.  
Crap. I heard that Tyler was sick. I hope it‚Äôs not true.  
Just wanted to say thank you for continuing to update this post, this is truly an interesting and informative read! Can't wait for further updates!  
If you make a TikTok account (which I highly recommend) will you please share it with us?  
Hang in there! I expect you're getting more and more busy as your doing much more than just Reddit and Facebook, with all the interviews going on and stuff?  
That's really rough regarding your grandmother's situation!  I don't know what I can write that would even begin to make a difference.  
If you could go back in time and repack your luggage knowing that this would happen, what would you change?  
You mentioned vitamin c being given for those lacking sunlight and to prevent scurvy. Yes, it will prevent scurvy, but it is vitamin D needed for the lack of sunlight, are they providing that? Any chance of them cleaning vacated balcony rooms and moving some interior people to them?  Don‚Äôt think I could handle 14 days confined to an interior.  
I've gotta say, it sounds like the captain and crew are doing such an amazing job during this shitty situation. They sound fantastic! Big props to them.  
Hey there, I‚Äôve been checking on this post multiple times a day! Sorry if you‚Äôve already answered this, but do you know how the process of traveling home will go? Once they let you off on the 19th, are your cleared for travel?  
Gotta say, that``s the power of reddit/informal news. No tradicional media could get better and more natural repport like this one. Good to know everything is going well with the people there. Hope all of you people recover psycologically 100% from this situation.  
I love cruising when it‚Äôs going smoothly. The first thing cruise lines do when a publicity problem comes up is take down the internet. Glad for you they‚Äôve sped it up now.   Can you please post a picture of your view outside and let us know where to find it? Thanks for all the updates.  
Would you rather be dock-side or ocean-side during your quarantine?  Thank you for keeping us posted!  Hoping you and your wife stay well.  
I love that you keep the frequent updates. What are you doing in your large amount of free time now aside from answering AMA questions?  
Continuation. OP, please start a part two with this stuff. Using the comments section is confusing at best.  
I have to say I'm impressed at how well you're holding up, I think I would go crazy after so many days without being able to get out. I hope neither of you get sick and you can come home soon.  
Any updates? I read there were 44 new diagnoses cases on your cruise ship?  
Keep the updates coming, look at your posts a few times a day. Not sure if you mentioned this yet, when did you board the ship, and how long was your original cruise suppose to be? And what was the original itinerary? Thanks, sending good thoughts from Cali ‚ù§Ô∏è  
Congrats to the Japanese Gov and Princess for taking care of everyone. Thanks for the AMA Keys. Another 6 days, rough! How much for a deck of playing cards, or some board games? Doesn't Japan have like gazillions of those? Too bad they can't give u guys something to do so it's not so stressful.  
We went to high school together! So sorry this is happening to yall. Hopefully some good comes out of all this after it's over!  
Just a heads up, a crew member is saying the people preparing your food haven‚Äôt been tested. https://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/health-safety/41-more-people-test-positive-to-coronavirus-on-docked-cruise-ship/news-story/11a3fa3af337979e642af920febbb2a3 What the actual fuck.  
Are the crew members being payed overtime?  
Wow that letter to the crew is such good news! I truly like how they are handling things.  
How‚Äôs the booze situation?  
Are you in fear of the Virus?  
Just want to say thanks for the constant  updates and you should 100% make this unique experience into a book, it's a fascinating situation. Obviously not a pleasent one to be in though, I hope you both stay well and head back home soon!  
This situation must suck. So let's focus on the positives! What was your favorite part about this vacation?  
They should put a concert or entertainment for you guys outside your window  
Christ dude. I hope you and your missus stay safe. Thank you for your updates. It's genuinely intrigued to read them.  
Bruh I love ur updates, they are wholesome but kinda grim ü§£  
Have you got toothpaste yet?  
Best wishes from the UK, thinking about everyone on the ship. Apologies if you have answered this previously, but I saw there is a Facebook group for passengers, are you all keeping in touch? I imagine there must be a sense of camaraderie amongst the passengers, shared adversity and all that.  Even with the hour and a half on deck, the interior cabins must be hellish. I feel so bad for the people in them, and heard stories of three people sharing a room and only one chair or bunk beds. Things must be bad for the smokers, going cold turkey.  
OP how are you both doing? Never mind. I just read all of your updates.  When this is all over. You should write a book on your ordeal. Your writing style is very enjoyable.  
So very disturbed by what you are going through. I know we can‚Äôt send a drone to drop off a Switch or bottles of booze, but what can we do? Reddit is an amazing community. Do you want jokes, suggestions for activities while you are essentially incarcerated, videos of our drunken antics, things sent to your parents at home?? Please let us know. Wishing  you every wellness.  
Thank you for sharing with us.. as you know, we are ONLY receiving limited information as to reduce hysteria. Praying for your continued negative status and the safety of all aboard as well as those that are ensuring your safety. ‚ù§Ô∏èüíã  
I'm sure this is a horrible situation for the passengers, but the good news is this is probably going to be a great impromptu experiment for researchers of this virus. Thanks for the updates, and hold in there

Being that your newlyweds and sharing the rest , ( your dog is adorable!) what about a wedding pic?  
I love how upbeat you are being (or seem in your updates) I have been jumping on here to look at your journal entries often. It really is interesting to get all these updates even of little stuff as they are happening to you. Thank you! Hope you dont get to bored or sick...  
I would recommend writing a diary and publishing it at the end  
I think maybe that's a better view anyway!  Are you starboard side? (Edit -- must be port side. Just looked at the map. Guess I had about a 50% chance...) I was following your trip out and back on a ship tracker, along with your tug "Awaji Maru" (Yeah... I'm on the edge of my seat, and now I'm a ship stalker to boot...) That's awesome about the Chick-fil-a and your bible study group. My bible study group was very concerned about you all before I found your post -- I've forwarded it to them, certainly some prayers are outbound from Colorado.  Stay safe.  
Hi - thank you for the updates. I saw on CNN about the cases being up to 135 (now 134) and thought of you and this AMA! Came here to check in on the updates to see if you guys are okay!  How are you guys on reading material and entertainment? I saw movies are available but what about books etc in case reddit ever gets old?  
Japan has cutting-edge technology in the bio-medical field. And naturally Japanese are brilliant in science, how do you feel after hearing about this?  
Do either of you have a laptop with you?  
That's for the updates. Used to sail Princess all the time with my family (we've since switched to a line with smaller ships) when I was teen and I had been on the Diamond Princess 3 times, back when it was doing the Mexican Riviera route in the mid-2000s. Just heard today that my best friend has some distant relatives on the ship as well.  
Just saw that Japan, after the 41 new confirmed cases, has decided to push the cruise ship, with all the passengers, out to the ocean and sink it, as a precaution. ‚Äã j/k Stay safe. Glad you have a balcony. I pity those stuck in the equivalent of a prison cell with no daylight.  
I‚Äôm so enjoying (is that the right word?) your updates, I keep checking in to see how it‚Äôs going! You mention that you and your wife are leaning towards staying on the ship, can I ask why? I think I would do the same for ease (I‚Äôm massively lazy lol) but was wondering what your thought process is. Good luck and congratulations on your marriage! Pretty sure once you make it being quarantined in one room together for two weeks you can get through anything ;)  
Thank you for writing and keeping us updated. This is really interesting. I feel bad that everyone is trapped. I hope you and your wife stay safe as well as the rest of the guests and crew members. I have decided that if I ever do take a cruise it will be with Princess Lines. They really seem to be making their guests as comfortable as possible.  
Thank you for your updates! You are in such great spirits despite the circumstances, and I'm glad you two have a cool view today.   Did y'all get hitched at the Garvan Gardens chapel? Saw your photo and it looked like it - went there on vacation and what a gorgeous place.  Hope you both continue to stay healthy!  
Where did you have your wedding ceremony? It looks shockingly similar to where I‚Äôm getting married this fall that if it weren‚Äôt for the trees in the background I would‚Äôve been convinced it was the same!  Here is link to a picture I found of it online if you want to see: https://m.imgur.com/gallery/pE0qt  
My grandparents are on the ship with y'all. Also from Texas! I just want to say that I am so glad to be getting news from people that are there and have some actual info. I'm trying my hardest to keep composure when we get calls from my grandmother.  
Hey! Just saw an interview with another couple about your age.  Also from US. They brought up something I hadn't thought about. Once your 14 day quarantine is over...assuming you're heading back home ASAP.  Have the US officials mentioned anything to you re another quarantine stateside? Keep up your positive attitudes!  THAT will help you get through this as much as anything else! You have sooo many people cheering you on and pulling for you!  
Hey, I read that you are from Texas. I live in Dallas...Can I do anything for you?  
Are you scared you'll get the virus? How are you coping?  
Confirmed on the news 60 additional cases.  At this point I wonder if it‚Äôs crew getting passengers sick or passengers getting crew sick.  They really need to have doctors and nurses in hazmat suits delivering all your food now.  I‚Äôm so sorry y‚Äôall are going through this.  
I'm so sorry, hope you are ok. Are you getting any kind of psychological support? like some one from a medical team coming to your room just to check on your mental health and calm people down?  
On the bright side,  this is the most well- chronicled honeymoon ever!  
It seems like the cruise company could distribute toilet cleaner, a scrub brush, and bleach wipes to each room so you could manage sanitation without people coming in. Has anyone suggested that to the captain?  
How are they handling people who need medication? I know when I go on vacation I don‚Äôt bring every pill I have but what I need plus a few extra in case something goes wrong.  Have you run into this situation yet or heard of others who have?  
So if they‚Äôre doing you‚Äôre laundry is there any chance of contamination when doing that since those who are infected would have the particles from coughing etc all over their clothes?  
Don't really have any questions been reading through your thread for the past few minutes. Wanted to give you and your wife love and prayers that everything goes well. I read you only have 10 more days of quarantine. Wishing you all the best and pray y'all can get home soon. Love from Atlanta!  
I just have to say that you and your wife are two amazing souls, toughing this out with such a positive mindset. It sounds like you have family here taking care of things, but I live in Dallas and please please please reach out if there is anything I can help with back home for you guys (anything for sweet Remy (I have 2 yorkies), or even things I know I would for sure forget about and get charged for, like picking up dry cleaning, cancelling any appts you may have had, etc). I‚Äôm a PA and saw that you are a nurse. If you need anything coordinated with your job, etc, I‚Äôm on it! I‚Äôm off all week and have way too much time on my hands! Oh and please tell your wife she looked absolutely stunning in those wedding photos. You two are an amazing couple. I‚Äôll be following your updates :)  
Just saw the cruise ship pop up in the news again today and figured I'd pop in to see how things are going. Glad to see y'all are surviving! How's the quarantine diet going? Still better than Jenny Craig? ;P  
Do you know if there are children among the quarantined passengers? Are they not losing their minds being confined to small spaces?  
Thanks for keeping us posted! Hang in there.  
The N95 masks. Could you please tell us are they with filter or no filter?  I see that there are two N95 masks with Filter and no Filter .  
When you finally leave, do you plan on going on another cruise anytime soon after? All jokes aside that‚Äôs crazy as hell. Hope everything works out. I need to do more research on this  
Were you two interviewed on the north Texas ABC news?  Im pretty sure it must have been you guys. How many infected is the ship up to? Last I heard it was 120.  
Luckily you guys are newlyweds!  Might be the best case scenario for being quarantined on a cruise ship.  Have you guys put any thought into what you are going to name the baby?  
Are you the couple that was on the radio? 104.7 johnjay and Rich?  
Do they give out sedatives to people having freak outs? I would imagine there would be a good number of freak outs. What about prescription meds in general? I'm assuming you're going to be on there longer than anticipated and maybe some didn't pack enough to cover their trip. Do they have pharmacy and medical services?  
Thank you for sharing your story and continuing to update. Have you ever watched Fear the Walking Dead? Following your story reminds me of the beginning seasons of that show, though you will have a better ending  
I've been following your posts daily - you guys have a hell of a honeymoon story, that's for sure! Do you feel like you've got answers down now if anyone asks you what 3 items you'd take to a deserted island? (And if so - what would you bring?) Do you feel like having medical backgrounds makes it easier to stay calm or does it just give you more informed "worst case" scenarios?  
You're doing amazing! I love coming back every day before I go to bed to read your updates.  
What is the status of y‚Äôalls jobs back home? Are they understanding? Do y‚Äôall have any pets back home?  
Any hookers and blow?  
[deleted]  
Good to have you back! I hope my comments didn't lost, still let me post again.  So one more thing..May I quote your reddit comments as a major part for my story ? Basically it will be an introduction of the passengers' lives on board.  Also I feel sorry that you didn't bring your Switch...So how do you plan to spend the rest of the day and even the days beyond? Can you communicate with other passengers, via Internet or other tools? What are their methods to get through these days? And a little personal request... To let our readers know you better, is it ok to share your occupation, age range (like 30s or 40s) and which state are you from in the US? Thank you so much.  
How much human interaction have you had besides your wife?  
If they made a movie out of this ordeal, which actor would you like to portray you?  
[deleted]  
Do you wish you had gone on a real vacation?  
Will you use  your free cruise credit?  
https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/f3dag8/free_porn_offered_for_cruise_ship_customers_under/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share This got me laughing. Is this your ship?  
Are you expecting a refund because when I went on the exact same boat they had told us before hand that this was the perfect time of year to go on this cruise because it‚Äôs the perfect weather and flat seas. Well when we went on it turns out we got hit by a typhoon and a tropical storm. The boat was never stable and canceled so many of their events. We all got severely sea sick so after we complained they gave us a $200 discount for the next cruise with them. So right now we are pretty happy to have not used it this year. I feel so sorry for all of you over there and I hope you all make it off safe and compensated fully.  
Thank you for all of your updates! And big shout out to Chick Fil A on donation!!! I‚Äôm a vegan now, but used to love the Chick! Do you have any special Valentines Day plans? Wishes perhaps? I bet another drone could do another drop. üòâ Keep the super positive additude you and your wife are the light in a dark scenario ‚ù§Ô∏è  
Do you know if these 66 new cases are diagnosed from the group of ~270 that were tested at first? Or have they done tests on more people showing symptoms?  
Are the disposable food containers a constant now? Normally I'm not one for waste, but I feel like that's a really good policy to protect both crew and passengers (and hopefully give the dishwashers a reprieve!)  
Have u contacted your employer and told him you‚Äôre gonna be a little late?  
Hey guys!! How are your employers helping you deal with this extended leave? Are you going to be paid for this time off? Is rent due? Are your jobs at risk?   Tell Rachel I said hi from reddit! We've mostly been talking in our group chat :D  
After this experience, how seriously will you take emergency preparedness for this virus once you finally get home?  
Are you thinking that if someone comes up positive without a clear contact trace from before the quarantine that they may restart the 14 days somehow? Maybe stricter or off the ship?  
1- Hope y‚Äôall don‚Äôt go insane! Hang in there! 2- Assuming you‚Äôve seen sick people... is it really THAT bad, or is it more like what I‚Äôve assumed, and basically is a bad cold with a bad cough?  
So glad Princess have come through with the refunds and a future cruise credit, any ideas on where you'd go if you were to use it? I hope the rest of your quarantine goes smoothly and quickly!  
12:09 Captain announcement! Coronavirus is now officially known as Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019).  Laundry is at full capacity, and we‚Äôll get another chance for laundry! This is great, because we don‚Äôt have as much laundry this time. We should be able to get most of everything washed.  Social media is really reaching the captain - he recognized the huge amount of support coming from around the globe. He says ‚Äúclearly, the world is watching us, supporting us, and driving us until the end of this difficult time. Buon appetitio!‚Äù Fun fact! The tv is having an interesting problem today. Everyone‚Äôs TV is in French/Spanish! üòÖ 13:16 Captains announcement & correction on my end.  44 new cases of covid-19, totaling 218 now. All guests that are 80 years or older in interior staterooms, or 80 years or older with chronic medical conditions have been tested already. Those who test negative will have the option of disembarkation to government quarantine areas in japan to finish their quarantine. Those guests who were roommates of someone who tested positive cannot disembark are this time.  Also, lunch + menu for tomorrow - looks like they‚Äôre going to go ham for Valentine‚Äôs Day. Our UK friends across the hall are excited for fish and chips!  Here are some pics:  13:52 Received an email from the embassy. Looks like they will be offering voluntary disembarkation to guests aboard, starting with those most vulnerable (chronic health conditions, etc.) to Japanese government quarantine facilities. We would likely be the last to receive this offer, but are healthy and in good spirits. Here‚Äôs a link to the letter: 15:00 Our cruise directors brought is some board games!  16:15 The cruise directors made an announcement letting us know that there was new entertainment on our stateroom televisions, such as work out videos, stretches, magic lessons with Sunny Chen (fun fact, an internationally famous magician is quarantined with us, check him out), or napkin folding lessons on how to make a candle. A well-being message was also shared, asking us to make a steady routine for our lives while in the staterooms. 16:55 Captains announcement!  Process of disembarking is well underway. His last announcement is being printed and sent to us so that we are able to determine if we want to stay on the boat or not. We think we will go ahead and stay on the boat. He stressed to us the importance of wearing our masks at all times outside of the room. 19:06 Captains announcement!  As he put it, another day down, and we‚Äôre one step closer to being done with our extended stay together. Guests that are identified as priority (chronic diseases, comorbidities, 80+) will receive notice tonight by Japanese health officials regarding the option to stay on the ship, or be looked after by the Japanese government on land.  More videos have been uploaded to the tv - one of which from Princesses Chief Medical Officer, providing information on the recommendations from global health organizations and the Japanese health ministry regarding covid-19. Some are anxious about the spread of the virus, but the captain hopes that this will address each concern anyone might have.  He states that keeping everyone informed is one of their top priorities.  We still have barges helping us perform essential marine operations, and there is no need to go out to sea for the time being. We will stay docked to daikoku pier in Yokohama until further notice. The captain has been receiving a good amount of letters - he is pulling three quotes from these daily, and sharing with the crew.  He reminds us that the health and well-being of everyone aboard is their top priority. We were assured that everything was being done to bring this trying time to an end. Six days to go, whoop! 20:30 Got dinner! Today, the food situation was much a bit better. We liked both of our dinners compared to other meals, and we even got KIT KATS! We got some other Japanese snacks as well, such as (we think) fried/baked noodles! It‚Äôs nice to be able to try new types of snacks even while confined. I‚Äôm ready for kettle cooked BBQ chips (or crisps, depending on your neck of the woods), though.  Here‚Äôs a picture of the giant bridge over Tokyo bay during day and night, as well as a picture of our dinner. We‚Äôve had a long day - off to bed for us! Thank you all for sharing a part in this, will update in the morning. We appreciate the support! 21:05 Anyone know what this is? It was just delivered to our door. It‚Äôs heavy!  
Just read that there are another 44 confirmed today. I hope something changes with this situation fast. It's getting hard to believe that all these infections are pre-quarantine. It's funny, I don't even know you guys but I'm worried about you as though you're my family. The internet is weird!  
Your heavy package (21:05) appears to be a case of bottled water.  
I check on this thread everyday to see how things are going. I'll definitely try to help get this post to the top. :)  
You should do some very minor edits to your original post to remove a few characters here and there so that you have enough characters to post a "continued on this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/ezrn2x/im_a_us_citizen_aboard_the_diamond_princess/fhglhd9/"    note at the bottom of your original post. (Near the top of your original post, you have a crosslink to IAmA that you could probably remove and have enough characters to link to your continuation.) Meanwhile, I've upvoted your comment, hopefully everyone will do it and it will eventually float to the top of the "best" sort.  
Thanks for continuing to share. I've been following along since the beginning. Its admirable how positive you guys are staying. I share your updates and photos with my kids at the dinner table each night (3,5,7).  
If you get a chance when you get off the ship to get Cheetos in Japan they are good.  Different from Cheetos in the US.  They are a little sweeter tasting.  
Following along from far north Dallas (Sherman) Tx. Been following since the beginning. We read through all your updates as a family. Your ability to stay positive through this all is awesome! Makes me proud of my fellow Texans! Let me ask you tho, the people who weren‚Äôt following rules on the upper deck and not wearing their masks... couldn‚Äôt that start quarantine days over like a re-set?   Shout out to your life changing after this, they will probably make a movie about y‚Äôall! I‚Äôm sure your lives are gonna change! So smart to start this thread! We pray for y‚Äôall!!! God is good, hang in there.  
If you press the three dots in your comment thread you can copy the link and paste it in your original post. That way it‚Äôs easy to find!  
My suggestion would be to stay where you are. You have been doing OK there so far, and it is hard to predict what exposure would be during transport.  It seems in pictures that people are masked but not wearing glasses or sunglasses. Those protect the mucous membranes of the eyes. If you do leave, make sure you wear them!  
Hope you both had a good night's sleep.  I am checking the updates as soon as I get to work now.  I hope today is a good day.  What are you planning on watching today?  If you have Netflix (which I think you do), Money Heist and The Stranger are both really good and compelling .  Curious question - as it is your honeymoon, do you two ( played brilliantly by Jim Parsons and Zoeoy  Deschanel in movie) still find time for romance during quarantine?    ‚Äã Fun fact:  I got to meet Zooey Deschanel in Austin when I was actor stand-in in a movie she was in (before Elf and before she got really famous).  She is both mesmerizing and a wonderful singer.  The movie is called The New Guy if you can find it online.  I didn't say it was good, I am just saying it has Zooey Deschanel in it.  
You are a TEXAN!!!!!!!! I must have missed that in all the posts. Be safe, and come on back home.  
Are you and your wife ever going to want to go on another cruise again, or did this experience turn you off it forever? If you had to guess, what % of the passengers will still be interested in going on cruise vacations and what % will swear it off?  
Can you add the date at the start of the day. I‚Äôm loving the play by play with the times.  
Sorry, I made an error.  We are on the Westerdam not the Volendam. ( last years cruise). And we are told no one has the virus.  No one is quarantined YET.  Plenty of coughs and colds among the 1700 passengers.  We have not been screened so who knows.  We made a big circle east of Taiwan and are now headed to someplace.    Like the saying..... we‚Äôre lost but we‚Äôre making good time üòÇ.   We‚Äôve stocked up on corona (the bottle variety not the virus) per your instructions.  It‚Äôs sunny it‚Äôs warm and plenty of food and drink.  Enjoying it while it lasts!!   Could be worse.  Can‚Äôt imagine we‚Äôll get off before they screen us all but who knows.  Our last stop was in Taiwan on Tuesday.  And before that Hong Kong. Thanks for posting.  You can‚Äôt imagine how much you‚Äôve helped!  
Thank you for doing this AMA, very informative, after this you should write a book (I saw above you were working on an outline). This kind of first hand account I think will make it in history books of the future (especially if this spreads and/or gets worse)  
My parents are scheduled to be on a cruise with more or less the same planned itinerary as this cruise on the second week of March. I‚Äôve be pleading with them to postpone their trip but they are reluctant to reschedule or cancel. As someone currently stuck in quarantine, what are your thoughts on this? I view it as an unreasonable unnecessary risk, especially given what‚Äôs happening in your situation currently.  
Please keep safe. 39 new cases on the Diamond Princess cruise today bringing total on the cruise to 174 cases.  Source: https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20200212/k10012281811000.html  
since you‚Äôre witnessing people with coronavirus - is it as bad as people think? because i thought that it was just like a normal flu, so most healthy people could be fine and it‚Äôs only people with an already compromised immune system who are at risk. but now i‚Äôm questioning, why would they need to quarantine hundreds of people if it wasn‚Äôt so dangerous?  
How do they actually test people for the virus anyway?  
Do they know who patient 0 is yet?  
So‚Ä¶ your dog's named Remy.  Just in case you haven't seen this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVOL3tMDzEs If you can get episodes of 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia', I recommend Season 9, Episode 7.  
You may have been asked this but are you ever afraid of being infected from the food you eat?  
heavy drinkers/people struggling with alcoholism or mental health disorders I'd imagine that some heavy drinkers and people with alcoholism will have heavy withdrawals if they cannot access alcohol.... that can be dangerous. Also, people with anxiety, paranoia, and mental health conditions could be struggling... do they have a medical team available for people like this?  
Thanks so much for this. It must be so difficult to keep motivated but you always sound so positive. Very best wishes to you and the Mrs.  
So how do they keep the crew handling and delivering the food from acting as mobile inoculators to all the passengers?  
Do you know what the source of this spread was?  
Currently living in Okinawa. A lot of people here are worried since your ship was docked at the port last week.  
I saw that 14 Americans tested positive after the evacuation form the cruise. Hope you weren‚Äôt in that batch. I guess quarantine measures weren‚Äôt completely effective.  
Will you do an AMA when you get infected? It would be totally rad to read about your symptoms until your death  
So just so I can relate I‚Äôll tell you of the accident that showed ‚Äúmy setup‚Äù to my family... parents grandparents and all accompanied family members.  Let me set the scene... Family reunion, volley ball in the back yard with my hefty female cousin. She hit the ball over the fence into the neighbors garden and I was convinced by my uncle I should jump and retrieve it as he figured she could not. I jumped off the top of this fence and landed on a 1/2 inch piece of steel stock that they must have been using as a truss. Entered through my scrotum and came out 30cm above ‚Äúmy setup‚Äù. I proceeded to pull myself off it in a fit of shock and jump back over the fence. The fence ripped me of my dignity and my pants were torn from my body completely.  There I am bleeding from the groin and my whole family (20+people)  shocked staring at my setup.  I was rushed to the hospital. Turns out the steel stock pushed everything vital out of the way and only damaged tissue.  Happened a few years ago, it‚Äôs gets better OP.  Just the occasional shishkabob joke now. TL;DR got impaled through the scrotum, 20+ family members saw my dick and balls covered in blood.  
Yeah, ok..I'll just sit here staring at my computer making a weird face and involuntarily cupping my balls.  
Fuckin a! That‚Äôs enough reddit for today.   
You‚Äôre a kinky guy! Own it! Might as well be ‚Äòout‚Äô about whatever it is you‚Äôre into. Have fun with it. Let THEM be embarrassed. Invite THEM to be as open minded as you. And then thank them for saving your life and loving you. EDIT: I realized this is an AMA so I‚Äôll add a couple questions to my unsolicited advice: How many sex toys did you have out anyway?  Have you considered writing a self-love ‚Äòhow-to‚Äô book?  
Two butt plugs, one largish realistic looking black dildo ( not sure why the color matters, but it probably does to someone involved here). Couple different lubes, nipple pumps (they probably have no idea what those are) and an Aneros.  This was all wrapped up in a towel and placed in my room by either my mother or my sister.   The smaller of the two butt plugs is "missing."  I have several theories.   1) it was in me when I called 911 and they have a protocol of not "returning" such a thing. 2) I did something with it in a panic and I'll end up finding it in a drawer the next time I move or 3) my freaky sister took it.   I know that last one sounds crazy, but it's like a 1% idea and would not completely surprise me.  
so obviously if you know your sister is so freaky she mght take a fucking used butt plug from you, really how embarrassed should you feel?  I'm not going to say I wouldn't be mortified in your situation but everyone is a freak deep down. Just remember the ones who would give you shit about it prob have some crazy shit locked in their own closets  
This is simple.  Yes my sister is freaky and I would not put that past her, but , as you suggest, taking someone's used butt plug from then while they are in the ER getting treated for a stroke is really fucking weird and I don't actually think she did...just that I think it's possible.  Not really something I want to accuse her of.  Plus, if I ever stole someone's used butt plug, I would deny it to the very end even if they confronted me...so I won't get it back regardless, and it would likely not bring about any goodness.  
If she always wanted stuff like this but was to afraid to buy it, then this was a golden opportunity   
From an EMS worker and works in the ED (emergency department), I first off want to thank you for calling 911 ... many ppl wait too long before calling, especially with stokes. Secondly, I‚Äôm glad it was a TIA and you made a full recovery. Thirdly, pls be aware that this can happen again and make sure to make follow up appointments with you PCP and specialist with neurologist to make any lifestyle modifications to reduce future risks of TIA and then stroke. To acknowledge suspicion 1) EMS has the butt plug.  we want nothing to do with what is up your arse ;) flattering though.   EMS would probably not remove the butt plug. If this happened, I would imagine it was in the ED.  We would always inform and talk to our patients privately about any matter and return the person‚Äôs property. That being said, some things can be lost in an emergency situation. But these tend to be smaller items. Socks, shoe, ring.  Most of the time we cut off clothes and you were already naked. We put all personal belongings in a bag and list out all items.  That all being addressed.... Do you have known high blood pressure or cholesterol issues? And as a follow up.... Were you at the time of the TIA using the butt plug? If you can‚Äôt remember specifically, I understand. TIA‚Äôs can affect some short term memory. Family wise: Are they religious, show any kind of discrimination issues against fetishes, etc?   
Yes, religious in a generic Catholic way.  Yes discriminatory in the usual religion driven sort of way....Jesus hates masturbation, and if we're supposed to avoid menstruating women, we certainly should avoid men who are shoving things in and out of their ass and moaning to themselves.     I'm still learning what is "typical" with these TIAs, but I do have a pretty substantial blur all leading up to the event.   It's less that I've completely forgotten stuff, but more that the timestamps all got erased and randomized...Like it's not a linear narrative.      Regarding the butt plug: It's the small one that's missing, which is usually the first thing in, and I had moved onto the deep plunging and eye-rolling part of the session, so pretty sure it was laying on the towel, but we may never know, I suppose.  I do not have high blood pressure and have low cholesterol - high HDL.     
The family situation is awkward as hell. I‚Äôm a recovered catholic.  I really hate the sex education they provide and guilt they create over normal sexuality. Obviously, the small butt plug can be replaced.  Have you ever had light headed experiences with your anal play? There is a vagus nerve that can have an impact on light headedness etc... so, pls keep this in mind and be careful.  
I grew up Catholic. What I learned from snooping as a kid, and from being included in conversations once I was married is that everyone is doing freaky sex stuff in private. My mother used to ask me to buy things from the xxx store for her, usually flavored lube. My dad hid his porn magazines in the bowling ball bag, including some collections of "family stories" that were deeply disturbing to me until I grew up and figured out those were sold in the middle of the discount multipacks and he probably hadn't specifically chosen them. My devout in-laws had about 500 bootleg porn tapes, all with at least 3 movies, and not just vanilla porn either.  My MIL (husband's parents divorced when he was an infant) always dated married men because they'd take her to restaurants and hotels and she liked being the other woman. She also had a stack of freaky Polaroid pictures of herself naked with a giant bush that she thought she hid well enough in her house. So basically, plenty of Catholics are freaks behind the bedroom door or do morally questionable things.  Your parents undoubtedly know that everyone masturbates. There was a woman in the movie you were watching, so they're not wondering if you're gay.  If anything does come of this, it will probably be your parents asking you to buy toys or porn for them because they want it but are embarrassed to buy it and don't realize Amazon would be private enough. That was a good point the other poster made about the vasovagal response. I've had one before to a gyn procedure and it felt similar to what you described. I would have thought it was a stroke if my doctor hadn't been right there explaining it.  
After you bust a nut, don‚Äôt you look around and think that it all seems so silly? Like, ‚Äúwhy the hell do I have all this stuff‚Äù, or ‚Äúnow I need to clean all this mess‚Äù.  I mean... ‚Äúdifferent lubes‚Äù? How many does one person need at a time? TWO butt plugs AND a dildo? I am hesitant to even ask why three devices are needed at once.  
So, the butt plugs are different sizes...one goes in pretty easily without much thought/buildup.  I then dildo myself for a while.   Sometimes I can hands-free orgasm from that, but usually, I'll work in the larger plug and then manually masturbate which feels great.   The two lubes are simple.   I use J-Lube for things that go in the ass, and Silicone based Gun Oil or Swiss Navy (basically the same thing) for my hand/penis.    But yes, I do experience a fairly predictable post-cum depression as I can't just nod off and go to sleep, but have to clean up all the gear.  Always feels pretty stupid.   Sometimes, I'll stop mid session, clean and tidy everything other than what I have decided I really want for my final fun, and then there is less to deal with post-ejac.   I'm always glad I did that.   Plus, I am often high while doing all this, which makes all the custodial stuff even more difficult and undesirable.  
Were you on drugs at the time of the stroke? I assume that's something EMS had to worry about?   
despite the obvious throwaway, i applaud you for your honesty. and thank you for making me realise i'm not at all a complex creature, sexually.  that all sounds like way too much work   
I don‚Äôt own any devices, but I do smoke marijuana. I would compare owning multiple sextoys, to the way a pot smoker might buy multiple pipes. Like, don‚Äôt you just need the one? Anyway I roll my weed, so I don‚Äôt own any of those toys either. I‚Äôm boring as hell!   
No way. I can justify any product I bought related to cannabis as being an upgrade to my quality of life. Any extra pipes (water bong or bowl) can easily be justified as several sessions between having to clean them. When I was a beginner and I had 1 single bowl, that thing would be so fucking gross by after a weekend or two, and I'd be to lazy to clean it more than once every 2 weeks or so. But as my glass collection got bigger, I was able to extend the time to clean by a lot. And now I just clean them all at once every other month or so.  Maybe I bought one too many grinders or something, but I'm totally not bummed out that I have a few grinders laying around that I don't use anymore.  
"nipple pumps (they probably have no idea what those are)"   Unless they were on reddit on that fateful day.  
Yeah, I saw that.  Was total bullshit with all the carpenter reference.  If you really thought those things were for carpentry, you would not post on Reddit...  
My father is an electrician and there has been many times  I have looked at various peices of equipment in his toolkits and thought they were for something inappropriate but found out they have very mundane uses.  I would assume it goes the other way as well.  
Not everyone is like you. That is a hard thing for some humans to understand. I have no idea what those things are, and I browse and post on Reddit frequently.    
Oh man Aneros looks like fun but my girlfriend would never let me buy one that expensive. Is it worth the money? Seems like I'm paying out of the part I want to stuff it in just for the branding. Is it overrated at all? As for a genuine question, do you share your hobbies with your girlfriend at all?  
totally worth the money if you have the time and patience.   It's a mental challenge to relax and let the sensation build without corrupting thoughts.   I liken it to meditation.  
I‚Äôm not sure if I want that in my search history. Could you use it in a sentence?  
If they had to remove it at the hospital it would have been sent to the lab for Gross Examination. Anything that gets removed from a patient, be it an organ, a biopsy, or a sex toy gets sent to the lab. When I was working at a hospital in the Grossing Room a few years ago we would get a toy every month or so. Sometimes a dildo or plug, sometimes metal cock-rings that had to be cut off.  All kinds of fun stuff!  
So you're not tempted to ask around your family "What happened to my favourite butt plug?" then?  
Makes for a good Thanks-giving dinner conversation  
[deleted]  
Plot twist - it's in the turkey.  
Its on the dash of the EMS Truck as a  conversation piece  
Paramedic here. There are more ‚Äútrinkets‚Äù in trucks then you would guess. Had a guy die jerking off while wearing a gas mask once. No one  had the balls to jack with that one, left if for the coroner.   
[deleted]  
My [women's] soccer team has a giant double-ended dildo that we sneak into one unlucky girl's bag after each game.   
This is really impressive if real and you should definitely be a reviewer or blogger or expert.  
Calling your sister freaky hahaha after your story legend   
Probably one of those storys you see on reddit. *Im a paramedic AMA*. Anyways that aside, glad you're ok. better that your well now than them finding you unconscious or dead in your living room naked with all your toys laying around.   
Well, better for them.   I would not have known the difference.   Not that I at all wish that had been the outcome. But it did make me think about the other things I might have that people would discover if I did die suddenly.     
 the other things I might have that people would discover if I did die suddenly.  You havent made a sex toy pact? You have one person, best friend, SOMEONE, who you're like. "Look, if I ever die, or something happens to me.... There's this box....( Or draw, or closet if you're a  Miranda aayyooo). Don't look in it, just throw it out" And likewise, you do the same for them. And that is how you delete your shame from the world and ensure your parents don't find your butt dildo while sobbing and cleaning out your things.  
My brother and I have this sacred pact.  He loves hentai and some wild ass shit. I don‚Äôt want to put our mother thru that.   
Hey, it's a drawer, not a draw. Very common in the Midwest. Just letting you know :)  
May I ask your overall health? Was this genetic? Etc etc? Something the family suffers from? Your age blah blah over reaching questions?  
Meh. We got called to an auto-erotic asphyxiation gone wrong. You have nothing to be ashamed of.   
We‚Äôve seen worse. Once got called to ‚Äúan attempted suicide via bleed out‚Äù I‚Äôm hauling ass because I‚Äôm thinking slit wrists. Nope dude cut his dick off.   
OOO that reminds me. We got a call for a "hemorrhage" last winter. No other information. Dude was bangin his pull out couch, some wire or metal from this ragged and ripped couch caught him, left a nasty gash on his bald headed yogurt slinger. Walk in with our bags, poor dude sitting next to his freshly lubed (now with blood) bang hole, stark naked as the day he was born, power grasping his junk with a towel. That was an interesting narrative.   
"Bald headed yogurt slinger" is now going to be worked into my conversations, thank you   
Yeah I'm pissing myself and trying to tell a couple people in the emergency room next to me why I'm laughing.  
Reading that hurt me physically  
Did he cut his dick off, or cut his body off and only leave the dick?  
I got a call for a degloved penis once. That was an interesting day  
Oh. Oh God. Degloved. I think I need to curl up in a ball and cry until my brain stops bringing up images  
You're in luck friend, no need to imagine, just go to google and image search degloved penis. What an age we live in   
That's pretty intense. Did they find it? Reattach it?   
Oh god, I had a nightmare like this a few nights ago and it scared the fuck out of me. Reading this made me squirm.  
Dude, my first question is why do you not have a porn buddy?  
Yeah, so I have sort of automated my pornbuddy.   I keep all my porn in .sparsebundle encrypted disk images.   I use AppleScript and Automator to force eject all my sensitive drives (some porn, some financial, some just criminally damning stuff) upon 1 hour of inactivity.   I generally remember to eject them myself when "done." but in the event of a stroke or something, I should be covered in that regard. It's fairly robust.  I guess I need a dildo buddy or something.  
This thread has made me realize how amazingly vanilla I am, and I'm kinda glad to be so.   
 some just criminally damning stuff  ‡≤†_‡≤†  
Right? I need more details on this one.  
Probably related to the drug use.   
Alexa, delete my porn and call the paramedics...   
20 foot of string and X number of motors hidden in the ceiling attach string to toys and motor then hookup to go pc program 1 hour inactivity everything fly's away  
What's a porn buddy?  
A porn buddy is someone who you trust taht when you die (or have a stroke) goes to your house and is responsible with deleting all your porn and clean up your sex toys or pull the dildo out of your ass so family doesn't see that.   
when i first read 'porn buddy', I was thinking it was a program everyone knew about and i'm an idiot for not having one. like what a great idea, an app that somehow knows when you die, and then deletes all sorts of things that would embarrass you. We have the technology, this needs to be done.   
Shhhlllluuuurrrrrrppp POP! Frank you really fuckin owe me for that one.   
A noble position in society I'm sure  
I'm fortunate that it's my wife. When I was in the US, I had one too.   
Like a Secret Keeper in Parry Hotter  
Someone you call in case of emergency to hide your shit, erase your hard drive, burn your journals, etc.   
Do you have any lasting effects from the stroke?  
I feel like my left hand is still somewhat numb, but that could be imaginary, and even if it isn't, I could happily live my life like this...Otherwise, no lasting impact.  
The only thing to add is that a TIA is often a warning sign of a future stroke. So some lifestyle changes might be helpful. However, strokes are also a bitch and can just happen randomly (like the 0-5 year old stroke patients I worked with.)  Take care, don't blame yourself & just try to move on now. Best if luck OP.  Also for others: Stroke is an emergency. It's a 999/911 situation. Here's the little NHS FAST reminder:  /F- Face - dropping on one side  /A - arm, weakness in one or both (unable to lift and hold them like OP) /S - Speech, slurred or jibberish  /T - Time to call 999/911  
You could have a hole in your heart. Something to look into. (Husband is doctor; I was reading this post to him, and that was his comment, for what it's worth.)   
was that a one time thing or do you have to watch out for more strokes in the future?  
[deleted]  
Interesting.  My birth control pills mixed with my ssri caused me to have one of these in 2012. It was horrible and the effects lingered for about a year.  I stopped taking both of those medications after it happened, but recently (2 days ago) started bc again. I sure hope it doesnt fuck up my brain blood again! And if it does, i really hope I'm at work....  
[deleted]  
Oh, yeah...sorry.   32, M, straight.   Live-in girlfriend of 6 years who was thankfully out of town on travel.   She knows I had the TIA and went to the ER, but I think that's all.   She is good friends with my youngest sister (not the one who was at my house) so she could know something, but we're pretty open, so I think she would have said something.   I do intend to tell her, but it's just been a lot.  
I don't mean any offence by this because I don't masturbate too much myself but, if you're straight why do you use dildos?   
Yeah, I like stuff in my ass.  The GF is ok with it 'sometimes' and not to the same extent a I would like.   She does the finger thing pretty much all the time, and has fucked me with "her" dildo quite a bit, which I like...but I really get off from extended slow fucking with the dildo and that usually means I'm doing it alone.   She knows I'm into "butt stuff" however not to the extent of being so organized about it.  
Sounds pretty gay to me   
This is why instead of utilizing dildo devices for rectal joy, you should instead utilize various sizes of sausages and uncut salami or pepperoni rolls. In this manner, when you have a stroke due to excessive strokes, when the emergency workers or family members arrive, they will assume that your malady occurred during an evening meal, rather than during your personal ass festival.  I have nearly died seven times while engaging in this behavior, and due to the fact that the remnants always involve sausage, pepperoni, or salami, no EMT worker or family member has ever deduced that these foods were up inside my ass.  As a vegan, I nonetheless am shamed by my activity.   
My kind of straight guy. Very cool. As for the embarrassment part? Could you fake your own death and move to Amsterdam? Lol listen, if you're GF is okay with it, then fuck everyone else.   
Well if that's not TIL material, I don't know what is.  
Ahh I get you man, I know that some guys do like their gf or wife to do butt stuff. The dildo thing just caught me off guard haha. Thanks for the reply!  
Not to be too graphic but if you‚Äôre genuinely curious, weather or not you‚Äôre gay or straight, if you‚Äôre a guy you still have a prostrate. Stimulation of it is a form of sexual pleasure, you can enjoy this regardless of your sexual orientation.   
You can use dildos and be straight. Gay people can use pocket-vaginas as well without being straight.  
Oh right okay. Guess you learn something new everyday haha  
You're really young to have a TIA, did they found out a cause ? I would let the embaressement go if I were you, first responders didn't care about any of it and I'm sure your family is just happy you're ok. They were probably too worried about you to care about the rest.   
This is very true. First responders deal with weird shit all the time, things much worse than this. Its pretty much part of the job description. Source: have a friend that's an EMT  
It's all just extra flavor for their stories  
There are a lot of guys into butt stuff. There's a lot of women that are into guys that are into butt stuff. Try not to feel ashamed. Who knows, maybe your dad has the small plug. ( /s )  
Did anyone lowkey teaze you about it? What kinda things did they say?  
I think I would actually like it better if they WERE teasing me.   They are just saying enough to let me know they know, but not really getting anything out in the open.  Mom just said "I wrapped your things up in a towel and put them in your room." and Dad saying things like, "I thought [girlfriend] was out of town."  etc  
I think they are just happy that you are okay,  alive and seem to make a good recovery and they do not mind about you masturbating with or without toys and they might even feel weird for having intruded into your private life even though without other option since it was an emergency and they didn¬¥t know beforehand what was lying around there.  
I‚Äôm pretty sure they are just as embarrassed as you are. I would imagine that they are more interested in your health than anything. I think your mom‚Äôs statement was her way of broaching the subject and letting you know that it‚Äôs alright. Dad might be giving you a little crap but, it will pass. Im sure it‚Äôs embarrassing for you but I don‚Äôt think you really need to bring it up as they already have.  I‚Äôm glad you made a full recovery.   
LMAO that‚Äôs such a dad response. He know what‚Äôs up but is trying to give you an out.   
Idk how conservative your family is, but if you‚Äôre able to poke fun at yourself for it, I would. They may be too shy to do it after all you‚Äôve been through.   
I think poking fun at himself is what got him into this mess..  
If it makes you feel any better, as an EMT you see many people masturbating. Most of them aren't having actual medical problems, and get super creepy. So they've seen it a hundred times, and were probably just relieved you weren't calling to try to harass them.   
Like, hey, let's call 911 and be jerking off when they arrive?   That's a thing?  
It's a thing, unfortunately.   
[deleted]  
Thank you.   Glad it made you laugh..I was hoping at least the world could share my pain with some giggling at least.  
Nothing over the top for me like this, but I think I was masturbating quietly (fan to cover noise) when I had a seizure. Family helped unconscious me through it and moved me back in bed. I was wearing one of my sister's thongs during this. She threatened me if I ever wore one again, but no one else said anything. Don't ask, don't tell hopefully goes down here.  
The world is very much giggling. Thank you.  
How often do you see your family? Do they have keys to your house or know where your spare is hidden? Reading this made me realize how much my family would want to be there for me if I had an emergency like this and how they wouldn‚Äôt be able to because they don‚Äôt have a key and I don‚Äôt keep a spare outside.  The embarrassment I am sure is scorching, but you need to move past it. They are your family and will love you no matter what. Write your parents a thank you note for all they did to take care of you. It‚Äôs a classic and classy move. You don‚Äôt need to discuss your personal pleasure preferences if it makes you or them uncomfortable; that‚Äôs a very private part of your life that they don‚Äôt participate in or need to accept or know about. They may be shocked, but if you give it time and send the thank you note, I am confident things will go back to normal. Wishing you the best!!!   
Honestly, I don't really know what they would think.   They are pretty conservative and I would bet they have that weird closed minded thing where they think healthy straight guys don't fuck their own asses with giant black dildos.   It occurred to me that maybe they think I had a partner over...or that I'm gay, but they know I have this LTR.   UGHHHHH...I thought about making a fake NextDoor account and creating a fake news thing about how there is this pervert who breaks into your house, has his way with himself, and leaves behind his slippery sex toys.   Ok, not really, but that's where my head is at.  
Did you have any symptoms leading up to the stroke?   
Zero symptoms...No high blood pressure or anything.    ‚Äã  
My ex had a TIA a couple of years after we met. There were no symptoms, and the situation was sort of similar- it happened about 10 minutes after we had sex.   
Man...now im worried. I was getting a blowjob once and when I came I suddenly had the most excruciating headache. And I never get headaches.  
This has happened to me, post coital migraine. Definitely get a Dr.'s opinion. In my case it was benign and the migraines stopped occurring upon orgasm after about 10 weeks, exactly as the Dr. told me they would. He said the condition is benign, not all that rare, lasts for about 10 weeks at a time, and usually comes back at some point down the road. Unbelievable friggin' headaches. Just indescribable. Like a hammer to be base of the skull.  
Not anything too crazy but in the same vein. Gave blood in high school for the first time and that evening got a blowie and passed out during. Came to and she was still going at it and had no idea anything had happened. Scared the shit out of me, I can‚Äôt imagine anything more serious   
It's a vagus nerve thing. I get it sometimes if I tense my upper body and shoulders up too much as I'm getting ready to cum. Nothing serious, just learn to relax when you're fucking or jacking it.  
Op you should have some additional testing done from specialist. These don't happen for no reason. I had a TIA after a night of drinking a few years ago. Mine was not as bad as yours so I went to the ER. They told me I was fine like you and let me go. My primary care doctor basically didn't know how to handle this stuff and told me I must have slept on my whole left side wrong... It took a long time to feel right. To be honest I still don't. It's almost like the left side of my body has poor blood flow now.  So after I was seeing a specialist about a vein issue I have in my legs they had me do some additional testing to make sure I'm healthy before doing the procedure because of the risk involved with it. The test was called a bubble study. I'm was sure it was going to come back good and was just ready to get the other problem fixed.  To my surprise I got a call that told me I have a hole in my heart called a PFO. It's a congenital defect I never knew I had and to be honest I thought there was no way I would ever have something like this. One of the ways people learn they have this when it's not detected in childhood is by having a TIA somewhere in your 30s. Just got done with testing yesterday to determine the size of it. The good news is a treatment available where they plug the hole. The FDA recently approved a treatment just a few years ago.  Get checked out!  
Who gives a shit? You survived a stroke!! Live your life! Be stoked you survived that stroke. I would celebrate! I would wank it again, except this time you can give yourself ‚Äúthe stranger‚Äù with your numb hand.   
Lol'd.   Funny you mention The Stranger....Being lefty, things just didn't feel right immediately after the event.   So I started dabbling with the other hand.   It's not quite there, but gaining ground.  
I thought this was on r/mma and was confused for a solid minute after reading this before seeing what sub it was on. Disregarding that, what‚Äôs your favorite brand of cereal.  
How old are you? What was going through your head while you were waiting for the first responders?  
Once the crazy symptoms started, time was kind of a non-entity.  I don't recall any waiting.  It was like pressing the last 1 in 9-1-1 made them magically appear at my door.  I remember calling, but don't remember any conversation and given what the paramedics said about my condition when they found me, I suspect it was just nonsense.  All I was thinking was that I was actively dying from something.  
On a scale of 1-10, how badly were you freaking out at the idea of dying?  
10...no doubt.   When your senses betray you so completely, it's fairly terrifying.  
[removed]  
Just took a cruise through your comments and was not surprised.  You're a very angry person.  There are several accusations of fagginess in your contributions to Reddit.  And the word "retard" is used by you usually as a noun.   Do you feel Reddit is simply over-run with homosexuals who have little intelligence as compared to you?   How can I help?  Maybe a robust and inventive masturbation session would change your perspective.  Or perhaps a stroke?  
Former paramedic here: Fire/rescue sees crazy shit all the time.  I once had a woman stuck between the toilet and the tub. She had been using a suction cup dildo on the edge of the tub and slipped. She was wedged in there tight, and we had to take the toilet apart to get her out. One of my first calls as a BLS provider was a 14 year old kid with his dick stuck in the intake hole of a hot tub.  The valve wasn‚Äôt that big, so I have no idea how he got his dick in there to begin with.  The squad had to come and cut a big hole around the valve, and we transported him with that hunk of hot tub stuck to his willie, which had swollen up into a purple ball. The worst part was that his mother was a VERY stereotypical Brooklyn Jewish mother, and she was losing her whole shit the entire time. I once had to chemically restrain a guy whose girlfriend put him in one of those little dick cages and went to work. They were into BDSM, and he was her slave. I don‚Äôt quite understand what happened, but apparently he got an erection, and was in excruciating pain. His girlfriend had the key to the thing. I basically just snowed him under with versed and haldol, and took him to the hospital. There was a guy who showed up at one of our local ED‚Äôs who lived 5 hours away. He had 4 apples lodged in his rectum, and had been to just about every hospital between our ED and his home, and didn‚Äôt want to go to the same hospital (or one in the same group) with the same problem. I have transported numerous men with vibrators lodged past the second sphincter. They all had to have them removed surgically. The surgeon opens the abdomen, takes the intestine in his hands, and kind of squeezes it like a pastry bag until the vibrator shoots out and rattles around on the floor.  So don‚Äôt feel bad. This happens all the time. Your family might look at you sideways for a while, but dollars to donuts, they have their own ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù quirks/kinks, too. Live your life, friend. I hope you feel better.

Don‚Äôt worry so much. That‚Äôs probably what they are thinking (straight men don‚Äôt do butt stuff, cheating on gf, etc.), but again, that‚Äôs a very private and intimate part of your life. They don‚Äôt need to know anymore details and it doesn‚Äôt sound like you would be comfortable giving them a more in-depth explanation of what was going on.   A thank you note, while it won‚Äôt address the elephant in the room, will help start the healing process. You are still their son who they love very much and they will always worry about you so long as they have breath in their bodies; it‚Äôs part of being a parent. They just want you to be okay above everything else. Breathe: time will heal this and make it less uncomfortable. Put on a brave face and they will likely take their cue from you and just put it out of their minds.  You could apologize to your mom for any discomfort seeing those things may have caused her and assure your dad that you‚Äôre not cheating on your gf and that all of it is just part of a personal hobby and that they don‚Äôt need to worry. That could invite unwanted questions though.  Maybe you could talk to your girlfriend (in detail) about it. She may have the best advice to give since she knows you and your family so well. Your romantic life and habits are the business of very few people; you, your partner(s), your doctor, and  maybe your therapist. I think if anyone would be able to guide you in the right direction, it would be her.  I‚Äôve had to confess some truly cringe worthy things to my husband and he‚Äôs confided similarly uncomfortable things to me and we‚Äôve been able to help each other through those difficult situations. That‚Äôs why you have a partner; life is better with two. You and your partner have committed to being there for each other when things get difficult even if you haven‚Äôt made vows and exchanged rings and all that. I would go into more detail about my own personal stuff but my friends know I post with this account and they don‚Äôt need to know all the nitty gritty details.  TL;DR Thank you notes help even if they don‚Äôt address uncomfortable situations directly. Ask your SO for advice since she knows you and your parents and may be able to help you better than anyone else.   
I like this, especially the second paragraph. I‚Äôm a mom (10 & 2 year old boys), and if I was OP‚Äôs mother, the last thing on my mind that evening, would be my son‚Äôs sexual preferences. That was a major health scare. The only thing I would be feeling is gratitude that my child was ok. After I calmed down, I‚Äôd just try to put it out of my mind. I wasn‚Äôt supposed to see that, and as long as it wasn‚Äôt something criminal, it‚Äôs not my business.  ...it‚Äôs weird because I still get crazy embarrassed when I think about the fact that my parents know I have sex. It‚Äôs actually horrifying, so I know how you feel. At the same exact time, as a parent, I‚Äôm very aware that my children will grow up and have sex, and that doesn‚Äôt bother me at all (not that I‚Äôm dwelling on it; it just doesn‚Äôt make me cringe). If I ever got TMI about their bedroom habits, I‚Äôd basically ignore it and move on. That‚Äôs what people do. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Seriously, I think most parents would just be happy their kid came home at all. I can nearly guarantee that you are more upset about this than they are. You‚Äôll be ok!  Edit: one more thing: if my super religious, super conservative parents can get over finding my brother‚Äôs gay porn alllll over the family computer, your parents will get over this too.  
Hey OP. Firefighter Paramedic here. Honestly they were number 1 concerned with your patient care first. After the call I‚Äôd be lying if I said they didn‚Äôt chuckle about it (hoping your ok though).  Probably 30-60 min later they moved on. Maybe sooner depending on how busy they are. We try to respect your privacy. Honestly most the time 99.9% of the time we could care less about the situation (granted variables ie your not in danger from your significant other or something) and we treat the patient then move on.  Will they remember you? Probably not. The situation? Probably. I still remember one guy who said he was ok and didn‚Äôt need a puke bag. He then proceeded to puke all over the back of my ambulance. I mean EVERYWHERE. Took us about a hour of cleaning to get it all. Ugh that guy. Not his fault though so /shrug whatever.  Don‚Äôt worry OP. Keep doing you and glad your ok!   
This is an easy one: own it. You're the only one that can make yourself feel any way about it. You have to choose shame, so don't. You said it best yourself, 'self love'. It's that simple. No one can shame you but yourself, and there's nothing wrong with what you were doing. The end.  To paraphrase the lovely Julia Child, NEVER APOLOGIZE. Do not twist yourself into knots of excuses and explanations.  Show yourself a little love and move on. And enjoy self care Sundays with gusto! Good vibes ;)  Edit: Gold! Wowserz! Thanks!

I feel like I have to buy all new toys regardless.   There's something just not-cum inducing about the following thought:  "Hey, this is the dildo I was fucking myself with on the day I had that stroke and I traumatized my family."   Plus, someone DM'd me and offered to buy the dildo for $100 postage paid, I shit you not.  
Sell it from a PO box or something and buy another one!  
Probably your Dad  
 to glisten proudly on the towel.   fckn' poetry right there  
Agreed ! Just think it was nice of your family to put stuff away for you so that you were ok to come home to a cleaned up room.   
"Thanks for gathering up my things, Mom.   I think we can all relax better when my living room isn't all cluttered up with ass toys." ‚Äã  
She's your mom. Do you really think for a second she didn't already know? If there's a lesson to be learned it's that your family handled this with grace and dignity. They care about you because they are attempting to help you keep your self-pride. My advice is to thank them with a card that says what is uncomfortable for you to say. They will appreciate it and you will feel better saying your part. Then put it behind you. <snicker> behind.....you.....C'mon man! We gotta laugh about it!  
couldn't have said it better. Remember, almost everyone has masturbated but it appears some with more gusto than others. change your mindset, forget about it and never feel you owe an explanation to anyone. Anyone that tries to tear you apart over this is not your friend and should be treated as such. Picture yourself 15 years from now laughing to yourself about this. It is kind of funny in a way except for the stroke part. best of luck, you don't deserve one second of grief over this.  
 You're the only one that can make yourself feel any way about it.  Preach, my brother preach!  
 Show yourself a little love   Lol did you read about his collection...  
I hear what you're saying, but I'd also like to suggest faking his death and moving to Australia.  
I feel like you're going to be battle-hardened after this experience. Surviving that level of embarrassment will probably make you completely immune to any embarrassment ever again. Pretty badass.  Also, glad you recovered. Turned out a lot better than it could have sounds like.   
Hey, I know it's an AMA but I just wanted to say that masturbation is completely normal, and strokes are not. It just so happens you had a bit of bad luck having one during your personal time, but I don't think it's anything you or your family should worry about. What's most important is that you're safe and recovering.  To stick to the topic, have you gotten a check up for any of the main causes? High bp, cholesterol, family history etc. Focus more on your general health, and less on your naughty escapades scarring your family. (After all, you're here, therefor your parents probably did the dirty and thensome to achieve that.)   
Wow so now you have the 500 lb. gorilla in the living room to worry about. I feel for you. I would just leave the issue alone unless one of your family members brings it out in the open. Sometimes it‚Äôs better if things are left unsaid.   
 Wow so now you have the 500 lb. gorilla in the living room to worry about.   I don't think they make dildoes that big. ¬† ¬† ...sorry  
Believe it or not gorillas have very tiny penises compared to humans   
I'm gonna go to the zoo to compare. I'll bring some bananas so the gorillas will welcome me into their enclosure.  
Put a banana halfway your anus. Maybe you get your ass eaten by a gorilla.

My overweight sister in law had a seizure and passed out while on the toilet in my house. But she‚Äôs so heavy my wife and I couldn‚Äôt lift her. She was totally exposed. But by the next day there wasn‚Äôt really any awkwardness left. We just didn‚Äôt talk about it and moved on.   
Not a throwaway and not a question.  Last March I was masterbating with a vibrator (I'm female) and as I had an orgasm it felt like lightning struck my head causing me to almost pass out and throw up from the pain. That was a Monday night and my husband was out of town for work.  I just thought I was having the worst migraine of my life and didn't go to A&E until Wednesday. It turns out that I had a subarachnoid hemorrhage  (stroke) that almost 50% of patients die from either instantly or in the first 30 days.  I only told my doctors that it happened at the point of orgasm; not that I was alone. I'm sure they all wondered why he didn't take me to the hospital immediately. The only person that actually asked that question was my GP when I went for follow up. I then had to come clean.  You lived! It sounds like you came through pretty well and you have a great story!  High five to my Masterbation Stroke Buddy!  
Not sure if it‚Äôs already been said, but often TIAs are a sign of a large stroke in the near future. Check yourself out with a neurologist sooner than later. Sorry about the embarrassing stuff. If it makes you feel better most of our stroke patient poop/pee their pants on arrival so that‚Äôs probably worse honestly. Especially the ones that are lucid enough after treatment to ask me where said pants are. Insider tip: I throw them away after checking the pockets. Assume most people don‚Äôt want a bag of days old soaked pants that have been marinating while they‚Äôve been in the hospital.  
Does your girlfriend know you're kinky?  It sounds like you're afraid someone might tell her what happened...  
Who knows she may be really into it and was afraid to show her kinky side  
Congrats - you just had your first orgasm!!!!  
Was there ever a more appropriate "take your upvote and get out of here you son of a bitch"?  
You might say it was (‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢) ( ‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢)>‚åê‚ñ†-‚ñ† (‚åê‚ñ†_‚ñ†) Mind blowing.  
Geez, I wish I had a stroke and a trip to the ER every time I orgasmed...  
I don't know, having a stroke is how I orgasm. Multiple strokes, rhythmically  
Oh god that‚Äôs mean lol  
 I was discharged a few hours later  I bet.  
They let him go out the back, too.  
I feel ya.  I had to have an MRI after getting a sudden massive headache immediately after a session with the battery-operated boyfriend.  I told the nurse line that it was "post-coital" even though my husband was out of town at the time.  Eek.  Hope you're doing okay now!  
Do you know what caused it?  
A TIA is essentially a warning stroke, or a more mild version of a stroke. It is a wake up call that you need to make some changes etc. Like others said it is caused by elevated blood pressure, blood clots, etc. Biggest risk factors are poor nutrition, smoking, and little excercise.  
Judging by his description of his sexual habits - OP gets plenty of exercise.  
A TIA is pretty much a stoke, it just goes away by itself. So I would say it was elevated blood pressure from masturbating caused a blood clot to enter part of the brain.  
Jesus. That's dramatic.  
Since you had a stroke while "having a stroke" I just gotta ask if Billy Squire was playing in the background??  
You have my support. If you set up a GoFundMe me page I will donate to it.  
Are you now scared to masterbate?   
Stroke of luck you still alive   
Were you able to communicate your address/details of your emergency/etc over the phone? (Like did the garbled language go away?)  
Usually 911 can tell what address you are at and dispatchers are probably well trained to detect the speech patterns of stroke victims. I'm also assuming he said "my butt plug" and 3.5 seconds later the firemen were at his door.   
Do you consider yourself a jack off all trades? Sorry about the pun, did you like the pun?  
Don't worry at all about it! All the first responders masterbate too. We  have to do our job and act professionally. We have seen much much worse so please don't stress over it! Makes for a more interesting call. I'd rather go to your call then go to a 300lb man who has anal bleeds in the roughest part of the city.  But I'm glad you are okay. Yesterday went to a call of a woman who stroked and was found on the floor in her bedroom, she could have been there for a day or two no moving at all. So you did the right thing and I hope you can busy out the toys and enjoy yourself still!   
The most crazy thing here is that happened to me too, 15 yo stroking and when I came a vein in my brain stroke and I got paralyzed my left side and couldn‚Äôt talk either, I crawled to the saloon and i passed out, my dad got me to the hospital directly. Crazy that first thing I did when it happened and I got paralyzed was to clean myself after cum and turn off my phone. I‚Äôm 29 now and my leg is still weak and foot too but can run and walk just can‚Äôt kick or jump on that foot, hope all good with you ( no one knows even today the real reason why it happened lol )  
This Reminds me of this scene From Scrubs episode my Lips are sealed [Mr. Gerst's Room] Gerst: [He's talking to a friend on the phone.] Dude, that did not happen. No, I'm in the hospital because I-- They think I have Avian Flu. [Elliot clears her throat and comes out of her hiding place.] I gotta call you back. How long have you been there? Elliot: Forty-seven... Forty-eight minutes. I'm not sure, I nodded off for a while. Mr. Gerst, I'm so sorry for laughing at you. But I have to tell you a story. When I was in the seventh grade, I was at a roller rink and I needed to go to the bathroom. So I just skated right on into a stall and I did my, uh, private business. And then when I went to pull up my pants, I started rolling towards the door, which as it turned out wasn't latched. Now, I don't know if you've had any experience roller skating with your underpants around your ankles--it's very difficult to stop. Unless of course, you know, you scream so loud that they turn off the music and everyone is looking at you. Anyway, that's how I wound up with the nickname "Roller Moler". Gerst: I'm sorry? Elliot: I have a mole on my ass. [She indicates the spot with her finger.] The cute kind! Not the hairy kind. Anyway, the next day at school I showed up with roller skates on and everybody cracked up. Gerst: Why are you telling me this? Elliot: Because I owned up to it. This is funny, Mr. Gerst. And if you don't just embrace it and become part of the joke then it will follow you around and devour you. Gerst: Can I get a look at that mole? Elliot: No. Ahem. No. So guess my point is embrace cuz personally this is funny as hell and I would tell this story after a while for a laugh  
What‚Äôs been your life‚Äôs greatest tragedy ?  
i was playing minecraft and once i got out of the cave it was night time but a creeper sneaked on me and killed me it was a sad day  
Creepers break the game for me.  On my server, I disabled them entirely.  
How do you do that?  
I stood up a Minecraft server running Spigot, and then added the AntiCreeper plugin to the server's "plugins" folder.  https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/anticreeper Prepping the spigot server is the hardest part, but I made a step-by-step guide for myself because I've had to rebuild it each time Minecraft has come out with a new version.

Why do you assume this is what a normal guy is?  
because litterly everyone on this subreddit has something special about them  
But ‚Ä¶ if everyone has something special about them, that would make having something special about you normal, would it not? That means you are special for not having something special about you ‚Ä¶ also, that made a lot more sense in my head  
That would make you the only one without something special. Thats special. And also a paradox

I've been video chatting with every one.   I love Chinese takeout. And ice cream. And chocolate.  I love reading a book in the bathtub but don't like to be along much now.  Having a cup of tea and a cookie and just chatting.   
Chinese takeout is the best! I sadly don't have many great options near me. What is your favorite dish? I love reading as well! I love the older sci-fi books like Ender's Game, Starship Troopers, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. I also enjoy a lot of fantasy book series as well that is a massive list. What would be a book (or series) you have read that you would recommend to me I am a huge chocolate fiend as well and I expect the cookies to be some kind of chocolate üç´  
I love honey walnut chicken, steamed dumplings and vegetable lomein with a side of garlic broccoli.  I love the Misborn series by Brandon Sanderson or the Stormlight archive by the same author.  
Journey before destination radiant.  
Are you Chinese?  
That is such a wonderful sounding meal, I'm really jealous lol Thank you for the recommendations! I will definitely be reading those soon  
Hey, I saw that you enjoy reading. I'm currently writing a book and if you don't mind PMing me some stuff about your life would absolutely make a minor character to honor your memory.  I truly believe the best honor we can give those who pass away young is to simply remember them, id love to immortalize your spirit into paper! I lost one of the few people I cared about to Leukemia 7 years ago, he was 23. RIP, Danner.  
All three of those things are amazing! Would you mind if I sent you a care package of some goodies?  
You‚Äôre a great person  
Legit just began tearing up from your kindness.  We need more of this in the world.  
You also made me tear up. Keep being beautiful.  
I would argue that getting deep into a book or series of books is not being alone, because while you're reading, you become a part of the world, and thus you're a part of everything and everyone. And they are a part of you. I would imagine this feeling is like what acid is like, but I won't ever know bc I dont do well with visuals  
Do you have a p.o box? I'd love too send you some care packages of snacks and other treats.  
I make chocolates at home. If you want to try some of the best chocolates you've ever eaten, give me a shout and I'll send some.  
Are you from the UK? I will absolutely send you a tea and book care package!  
What are you dying from? Is there no treatments? Does your family know you are dying? Whats your opinion on death and afterlife?  
I have acute myeloid leukemia. I haven't responded well to treatment. Yes, my family knows. I'm hoping there's an afterlife so I can experience more. I wish I wasn't dying.  
You mentioned food! What is your absolute favorite meal?  I am teaching myself to cook so I love to try new things. 50 years old and still learning. Right now I am trying to learn Indian curries. I went there and fell in love with paneer cheese. Its tough to find here in Qu√©bec but I am determined. I am also trying to master lentils. Its hit or miss. Like tofu I'm not sure sometimes if I like it. I'll make a special meal to celebrate food and your life.  
Completely off topic but you can make your own paneer using milk and lemon juice. Loads of recipes online.  
Not off topic at all. Thanks for the tip I will look it up. I envisioned it being complicated.  
Hello from Quebec as well, (Saguenay).  
If you live in Montreal and surrounding suburbs/areas, finding paneer is really easy. Just go to any Indian grocery store. Rue Jarry in Parc Extension or Boul Des Sources in DDO.  
this is the most wholesome thing I've read. You're an amazing human.  
Hey, I have ALL, 22F. I have responded to treatment but it‚Äôs a hard road to travel. My condolences to you and your family. My spiritual beliefs may not coincide with yours, but I do believe in an afterlife that your soul is most comfortable with. I would leave a nice letter behind for your family, but do whatever that will make you comfortable.  
I won't say I believe 100%, but I had experiences, including a waking vision where my grandmother communed with me, that a Creator made us, and every "good / harm no one" religion / faith worships a different aspect of this creator, and so all of these religions and faiths are correct. That there is no hell, what we do on earth separates our soul here on earth and hurts us HERE but once we die, we are cocooned and purified and made whole, to be in pure peace and love. It wasn't the first time I experienced it, but it was the most intense, and it just ... utter peace and love. Every time I see a loved one every "flaw," or bit of anger they had is washed away and they are their best selves. I really hope I wasn't just hallucinating. I don't think I was. I had a vision the day before somebody I loved died, and the night before my cat passed I dreamt he was being led to heaven. I offer that as possible evidence that I wasn't hallucinating.  I'd like to believe that you can be reincarnated. Please have as much fun as you can in the meantime.  
My dad is approaching the end from a similar Leukaemia. He was given weeks and at the same time we found out mum had stage 4 Pancreatic cancer and has a similar length of time left. It's kind of romantic that they reach the end together. I think you are a wonderful and brave person and I wish you all the strength and positivity to push on and face this. Love to you and yours and live all the way ‚ù§  
I read something once that comforted me about death and dying. It said something like "I was dead for billions of years before I was born and it didn't bother me at all." Hope this comforts you in some way. You sound like a cool person. Also if you could get access to VR chat, seems like you might enjoy that since youre looking for friends to talk to online.  You're awesome.  
I recently read a book on near death experiences. Everyone who died and was brought back to life described it as extremely peaceful, and no longer feared death. The book is called "Lessons from the light".  Not sure if this helps but thought it would be a unique insight.  
Lessons from the Light What We Can Learn from the Near-Death Experience by Kenneth Ring, Evelyn Elsaesser Valarino  This relaunch of a popular title by Ring (considered by many to be the Dean of Near Death Experience Researchers) includes a new foreword by Caroline Myss. Lessons from the Light extracts the pure gold of the Near Death Experience (NDE) and with a beautiful balance of rigorous research and human insight reveals the practical wisdom held within these experiences.

I believe that there is an afterlife. It is a comforting thought and not one that people should give up or ignore. In this universe it helps to have faith in a loving creator who will comfort us in the end. There is nothing wrong with that very real comfort that comes with belief. Stay strong and keep your faith strong. I love you and hope you experience peace.  
I‚Äôve traveled to one of the most haunted buildings in America as an atheist searching for truth and left convinced of an after life by what I saw.   As a result, I‚Äôve opened up to other ideas science won‚Äôt even consider and have experimented with Remote Viewing and have been able to accurately describe events and targets using nothing known about the location except for a tag assigned to it - a random series of 8 numbers.  I‚Äôm just some guy on the internet but I will tell you without a shadow of a doubt that there is more to existence than what materialist science teaches us.   I‚Äôve no doubt that there is an after life. Your existence does not end here.  
You are so loved and cared about ,you are an amazing courageous human. It‚Äôs going to be okay . I‚Äôm sorry you had to cancel your ‚Äú living funeral ‚Äú my heart is breaking and expanded at the same time . I don‚Äôt know how to put how I feel into words other than you are just amazing . You come off fearless but I know no one is truly not scared of death for that I‚Äôm just blown away . What is your favorite cause you‚Äôd like donations to go to? I‚Äôm sorry if this had been asked before. You‚Äôve gotten a lot of love and I just had to stop for a minute and show you mine . You will not be forgotten by all of these people. I‚Äôm sorry if I said anything wrong , I just had to show my love to you even if I don‚Äôt personally know you .  
What are some things you would like to do before you die? Even if they are things that you don't think will be able to happen, I would still like to hear what are things you wish you could do before you die.  
I hope you are still with us, OP.  ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è  
For what it's worth, I believe in an afterlife. An afterlife with those around you again, that you have loved and lost. And more will join you after you are there. Life here is just one part of who we are. I believe there is a God, there, that is more of a loving literal father, in who's image we are made, rather than a nameless, shapeless being.  Your goodbyes will be hard, I'm sure. Rest assured, they are only for a short time. :) Good luck, with everything! I can't pretend to know you or what your situation would feel like, but just know that there are lots of people thinking about you right now, hoping or praying for your physical and mental comfort.  
Btw you can message me whenever OP. I might not be suffering with you, but i can listen if you want to rant. Everyone deserves to have some good friends.  
how is your boyfriend handling the thought of your death?  
It's been hard of course. He's a couple years older than me and out of college. He is going to be with me at the end. He's able to take the time off of his job. He promised he'd be there holding my hand.  
Let your boyfriend know an Internet stranger thinks he is an awesome person  
Let him know that a second internet stranger thinks he is an awesome person  
Let him know a third internet stranger thinks he‚Äôs an awesome person.  
I‚Äôm really sorry, losing a significant other at such a young age is incredibly tormenting and I wish you and your boyfriend all the best.  
That‚Äôs amazing. I‚Äôm proud that you‚Äôve accomplished what you have in your 20 years of living. Leukemia sucks!!  
Hugs. All the hugs. For you, for him, for those who know you.  
I know this sounds kinda crazy, and a bit on the morbid side. But, I watched my wife flat line in front of me, and had to be put into a medically induced coma for nearly 3 months while recovering from an illness, where I didn't know if she was going to make it back once put into the coma.   Not being able to say anything to her when all that went down was one of the hardest things ive ever had to deal with in my life. When everything goes down, make sure the both of you have nothing left unspoken.    Hes a damn good man from the sounds of it. I hope the two of you have the best possible existence with each other while its available.  
Why did you have to cancel it? Any chance that you could postpone it if you live long enough? How do you plan to spend the time you have left? Can I give you a hug?  
Covid. I don't think things will be better while I have good quality of life. I'm at home with my family for now just trying to talk to every one.  
Big hug, first off. You‚Äôre going through what we all will go through but with more of an idea of timing than most and younger than anyone would wish for. As you well know, that makes your remaining time in your body and with your loved ones feel really special and important. Given this and the fact that everything you experience is essentially through your mind, I have a couple of unsolicited suggestions for you. If you can shift the way your mind processes experience a bit, you can radically improve your experience in your remaining time here. What are some ways to do this? One of the best is mindfulness meditation and there are some good apps and teachers out there. Off the top of my head I‚Äôd say Tara Brach and Jeff Warren (on the Calm app) or Sam Harris on his app Waking Up come to mind. But, given the time frame you mentioned (and, of course no one really knows) I‚Äôm going to bring up another, complimentary ‚Äúpath to the waterfall‚Äù which is psychedelic therapies. The last ten years have produced incredible research showing how effective these therapies have been for what the medical establishment has come to call ‚Äúend of life issues‚Äù.  I think taking a look at this might be really worth your time and if you DM me I can offer suggestions about how you might investigate your options.  
Could you possibly still have your party and just request that people who come quarantine for 2 weeks prior?? I bet people would do that for you. If it were someone I love and it was the last time I knew I would see them, I would definitely complete secluded myself for them.  
You might, and I believe most of the OP's friends would have the good intentions to do it, but all it takes is one person who slips up even a little bit and then OP either has to deal with covid on top of everything else in her last days, or the guilt of someone having caught covid at her party. It sucks and it's so so hard, but I really respect that OP is staying safe for her own/her friends' sake even at this time in her life.  
e.g. my brother this Christmas who agreed to an absolute 100% quarantine prior to Christmas who then went to bars every day for a week prior to the holidays and gave us all covid.  
This. It‚Äôs rough but worth it. My friend died of a brain tumor complication a few months ago. I‚Äôm sad that we didn‚Äôt get to see each other since last February, but happy that all of his family and friends are well. On the flip side his family and friends and I are in touch because this whole thing made me join Facebook to keep up with everyone else I know IRL. If it had happened without Facebook many of us might have been grieving alone or may not have known what happened.  
angrily : CAN WE GIVE YOU A HUG??  
I'm so sorry you're going through this. Life just isn't fair sometimes.  What are you most sad about never getting to experience?  
I really wanted to get married and have kids.  
You could get married in the time you have left. Get yourself to Vegas and hire Elvis?  
And if they want a kid, they can adopt me! I‚Äôm 28 years old, but I can act super childish sometimes so it will be a similar experience  
I see you're having trouble figuring stuff out eh u/ill-figure-it-out , same here..  
Hey Theresa, what's your favorite movie?  
Ummm. I really like a big range of movies. I like the Hunger Games Trilogy and the books too. I like Star Wars and The Devil Wears Prada and Ever After.  
You should watch two movies before you go: #1. Harvey (1950) and #2. Harold and Maude. Best of luck to you!  
I like Harvey a lot!  
Harold and Maude might hit a little close to home, but I think you'll like it.  
Heck yeah! :)  
Ever after is my favorite!!! I had the biggest crush on Dougray Scott when I was little. It‚Äôs such a beautiful movie, too. You know that Le Peu is the same actor who wrote and played Riff Raff in Rocky Horror?  
Hello! What would you say to those who are healthy and yet are completely unsure of what they want to do in life! Thanks :)  
I‚Äôm kind of in the same position as OP and I just wanna say that if you ever feel like you want to die or it‚Äôd be better off being dead, take a breather. I felt that way before my diagnosis and now all I want to do is live. I appreciate everyday where I wake up and talk to those I love.  
Don't ever put things off thinking there is "always tomorrow."  
23 y/o guy here... Teary eyed from this comment :/ You should write something. Or record yourself, say, dancing, or eating ice cream, if that's what you like. Something to leave for the living, even though that might be the least of your concerns. I know it would be the least of mine with those news. Also I'd spend the little of what's left of my bank account on doing some extreme bucket list stuff I've always wanted, like water skiing, bungee jumping, rock climbing, and similar. Though, yeah, I don't know what physical state you're at currently. I meant this in the best way possible, too, sorry if it sounds.. weird. Idk. I'm weird. And emotional right now from this comment.  
You said you want to make friends and talk until the end, I'm totally available. I'm also a girl, 24. I have some good stories I can share.  But to begin with, what's your guilty pleasure? Mine is pasta, or pizza. Pretty much any comfort food.  
I love ice cream. But pizza and pasta are great to. DM me if you'd like  
If you could relive one moment of your life, what would it be?  
Probably falling in love  
Have you dated anybody before?  
Yes, I have a boyfriend for 4 years  
How are things with your boyfriend? How does he cope with what you re going through and how does it affect your relationship?  
I'm so glad you got to experience this incredible feeling!  
so yeah i‚Äôm crying now but so happy you got to experience this. I‚Äôm still waiting myself but this makes me want to open up to someone asap lol  
Who is your favourite author? What is your favourite movie?  
I like Jodi Picoult and Suzanne Collins and John Grisham the most.  
Yesss John Grisham is the best!  
I recently read a book called Mortality by Hitchens, where he writes about living while terminally ill (he calls it a year of living dyingly). It‚Äôs a good read!  
What is your favorite animal? Do you have any pets?  
I love cats. I have 2  
What are they called?  
Earl and Lady Grey (like the tea)  
üòç so cute. What colour are they?  
What is one thing you wish you could do? A place you would like to see or something?  
I wish I had traveled more. When my boyfriend graduated college two years ago we went on a trip to celebrate. It was amazing. I'd love to go more places.  
What if everyone took a short video of where they lived and sent it to you?  See the world through our eyes xx  
Are you religious?  
Not really, no.  
That's fine. I hope you can find solace in a life well lived, instead of relying on a mythical afterlife.  Judging from what you wrote here, you seem to be a very empathic person and i'm betting you will live on in a lot of people's hearts. Kindness is a butterfly effect that ripples through time. You have no idea how much those moments you shared with others will continue influencing their lives and the lives they touch. That is the only eternity in our reach. My heart goes out to you. I wish you all the happiness and peace in the time you have left.  
Are you dating somebody? How are things going on with them?  
I've had a boyfriend for 4 years. It's hard knowing I'll be leaving him.  
You won't, it's going on 25 years since I lost someone very close and I think about them all the time. I know this doesn't mean much, I just wanted to give you an outside perspective and the love never went away. Go be in the sunshine together so you'll meet again when the sun rises.  
Where are you from?  
I'm in West Virginia, USA  
Sending love from the UK üíï. Thank you for answering my questions üòä I am so sorry you are going through this.  Is there anything is internet randomers can do for you before or after you pass? (I am so sorry for the wording, really tried to think of a better way of putting it)  
Have you read the new hunger games book? Its pretty fun!  
Yes, I liked it a lot!  
How did you feel about the ending? I read it with my wife and we both agree that the ending feels... rushed. Almost like it could of gone for another 2 or 3 chapters, just with how quickly he changed his attitude (trying to not spoil anything for those who have not read it).  
Did you have sex or will you die as a virgin?  
I know you have a good intentions, but man.. it‚Äôs rude lol  
I'm 20 and I've been in a relationship for 4 years so...  
Favorite book.  
Probably the Hunger games prequel and series  
I don't have any Questions for you, but perhaps a bit of comfort for a topic a lot of people fear. Two weeks after I turned 25yo, I suffered from a Grand Mal Seizure out of nowhere during a nap I took after work. I died for roughly 3-4 minutes. I foamed at the mouth, everything in my body stopped, I turned blue. I was lucky enough to come back to life with CPR and a paramedic, but the feeling of death never left me. So let me tell you how it is. Death is peaceful. It doesn't hurt at all.  For me, I didn't feel the dying aspect of my seizure since I was already asleep when it started, I just felt the death and coming back to life feelings. So I can't give you much info on how that trip will be for you as you go. But I can tell you that crossing over to death has no pain. It's more like when a person becomes hypothermic but feels warm, Like a cocoon.  It is not violent, it's just like going to sleep in the softest, fluffiest, pillow.  I know this doesn't alter your fate, and I know a lot of people fear death.. but when the time comes, I hope this information brings you some form of comfort. You'll be safe when you cross over...  Life will take care of everything else on this side. üíìüíîüíì  
Not OP but I‚Äôm in my 20s with a strong fear of death so thank you so much for this comment. It‚Äôs incredible what you‚Äôve gone through and I‚Äôll remember what you‚Äôve said.  
This gave me chills in the best way. Thank you for sharing your experience, it feels sacred and it‚Äôs given me a lot of peace.  
Person who‚Äôs been through NDE here! I had the same feelings!  
Not trying to sound like a butthole or anything dying young sounds sucky but have you thought about how you won‚Äôt have to deal with anything anymore no bills no rent you won‚Äôt have to worry about what other people think of you what people say about you, you don‚Äôt have to worry about how you have to find a mind numbing career to be normalized in today‚Äôs society I feel like that would be a big weight lifted off your shoulders I know you‚Äôd rather prefer to experience stuff like that but me personally I do not look forward to having to buy a house having to find a partner having kids all that stuff I don‚Äôt want any of that tbh how do you feel knowing you don‚Äôt have to deal with that?  
I'd honestly love to experience any of those things. I always think you have to take the good with the bad. You can't have one without some of the other. You have a very pessimistic outlook on life.  
(I FOUND IT!) The Egg By: Andy Weir You were on your way home when you died. It was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable, but fatal nonetheless. You left behind a wife and two children. It was a painless death. The EMTs tried their best to save you, but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered you were better off, trust me. And that‚Äôs when you met me. ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what happened?‚Äù You asked. ‚ÄúWhere am I?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou died,‚Äù I said, matter-of-factly. No point in mincing words. ‚ÄúThere was a‚Ä¶ a truck and it was skidding‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúYup,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I died?‚Äù ‚ÄúYup. But don‚Äôt feel bad about it. Everyone dies,‚Äù I said. You looked around. There was nothingness. Just you and me. ‚ÄúWhat is this place?‚Äù You asked. ‚ÄúIs this the afterlife?‚Äù ‚ÄúMore or less,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAre you god?‚Äù You asked. ‚ÄúYup,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm God.‚Äù ‚ÄúMy kids‚Ä¶ my wife,‚Äù you said. ‚ÄúWhat about them?‚Äù ‚ÄúWill they be all right?‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I like to see,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou just died and your main concern is for your family. That‚Äôs good stuff right there.‚Äù You looked at me with fascination. To you, I didn‚Äôt look like God. I just looked like some man. Or possibly a woman. Some vague authority figure, maybe. More of a grammar school teacher than the almighty. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll be fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way. They didn‚Äôt have time to grow contempt for you. Your wife will cry on the outside, but will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it‚Äôs any consolation, she‚Äôll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù you said. ‚ÄúSo what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?‚Äù ‚ÄúNeither,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be reincarnated.‚Äù ‚ÄúAh,‚Äù you said. ‚ÄúSo the Hindus were right,‚Äù ‚ÄúAll religions are right in their own way,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWalk with me.‚Äù You followed along as we strode through the void. ‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù ‚ÄúNowhere in particular,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just nice to walk while we talk.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the point, then?‚Äù You asked. ‚ÄúWhen I get reborn, I‚Äôll just be a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my experiences and everything I did in this life won‚Äôt matter.‚Äù ‚ÄúNot so!‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. You just don‚Äôt remember them right now.‚Äù I stopped walking and took you by the shoulders. ‚ÄúYour soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are. It‚Äôs like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it‚Äôs hot or cold. You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you‚Äôve gained all the experiences it had. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been in a human for the last 48 years, so you haven‚Äôt stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you‚Äôd start remembering everything. But there‚Äôs no point to doing that between each life.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow many times have I been reincarnated, then?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh lots. Lots and lots. An in to lots of different lives.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThis time around, you‚Äôll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD.‚Äù ‚ÄúWait, what?‚Äù You stammered. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sending me back in time?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, I guess technically. Time, as you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come from.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere you come from?‚Äù You said. ‚ÄúOh sure,‚Äù I explained ‚ÄúI come from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me. I know you‚Äôll want to know what it‚Äôs like there, but honestly you wouldn‚Äôt understand.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù you said, a little let down. ‚ÄúBut wait. If I get reincarnated to other places in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point.‚Äù ‚ÄúSure. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own lifespan you don‚Äôt even know it‚Äôs happening.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the point of it all?‚Äù ‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúSeriously? You‚Äôre asking me for the meaning of life? Isn‚Äôt that a little stereotypical?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs a reasonable question,‚Äù you persisted. I looked you in the eye. ‚ÄúThe meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou mean mankind? You want us to mature?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.‚Äù ‚ÄúJust me? What about everyone else?‚Äù ‚ÄúThere is no one else,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIn this universe, there‚Äôs just you and me.‚Äù You stared blankly at me. ‚ÄúBut all the people on earth‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúAll you. Different incarnations of you.‚Äù ‚ÄúWait. I‚Äôm everyone!?‚Äù ‚ÄúNow you‚Äôre getting it,‚Äù I said, with a congratulatory slap on the back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm every human being who ever lived?‚Äù ‚ÄúOr who will ever live, yes.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Abraham Lincoln?‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre John Wilkes Booth, too,‚Äù I added. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Hitler?‚Äù You said, appalled. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre the millions he killed.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Jesus?‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre everyone who followed him.‚Äù You fell silent. ‚ÄúEvery time you victimized someone,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúyou were victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you‚Äôve done, you‚Äôve done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was, or will be, experienced by you.‚Äù You thought for a long time. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù You asked me. ‚ÄúWhy do all this?‚Äù ‚ÄúBecause someday, you will become like me. Because that‚Äôs what you are. You‚Äôre one of my kind. You‚Äôre my child.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhoa,‚Äù you said, incredulous. ‚ÄúYou mean I‚Äôm a god?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo. Not yet. You‚Äôre a fetus. You‚Äôre still growing. Once you‚Äôve lived every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be born.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo the whole universe,‚Äù you said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs just‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúAn egg.‚Äù I answered. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs time for you to move on to your next life.‚Äù And I sent you on your way. (I also sent it to you in a private message it looks like it‚Äôs not formatted very easily and I apologize for that!)  
Not really a question, but if you can spare a minute I want you to watch this scene from Lord of the Rings.  https://youtu.be/PbLKjO2ImGo  Just be aware of the horrible (and loud) editing at 1:06. Here's the text for you: PIPPIN: I didn't think it would end this way. GANDALF: End? No, the journey doesn't end here. Death is just another path, one that we all must take. The grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass, and then you see it. PIPPIN: What? Gandalf? See what? GANDALF: White shores, and beyond, a far green country under a swift sunrise. PIPPIN: Well, that isn't so bad. GANDALF: No. No, it isn't.  
This is amazing dude.  
LOTR is amazing. The best movies I will ever see, I'm sure. I cry even after the 10th time I watch them. A masterpiece of JRR Tolkien and Peter Jackson.  
This is my favourite (non meme) scene of lotr. Truly heartbreaking  
You're dying and have come to accept this, and I'm sorry about that. However, you say you "had to" (not "chose to") cancel your funeral. Why are you willing to have others congregate for you and risk their lives and potentially their families with what is going on in the world right now?  
I DID "choose to" cancel my living funeral. For the safety of my friends and family. Way to nit pick about words.  
I forgot to ask if your name is actually "Karen"?  
Look, man. I know this comment was left one year ago, but as I'm reading this now, I'm just thinking, "HOW INSENSITIVE DO YOU HAVE TO BE TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO SOMEONE WHO'S EXPERIENCING THEIR LAST DAYS OF LIFE?". Really horrible, dude. Get a life.  
I know this is weird to ask but are you excited?  
Messed up question, of course I'm not.  
Hello, i have no question for you but i just wanted to tell you to stay strong and live the remaining months you have to the fullest i am sure your friends and family will always remember you and look up at the sky and pray for you.  i‚Äôd say i‚Äôd come to visit you while you‚Äôre in heaven but i can sometimes wave at you from hell if you happen to look out from the heaven gate. So long my Reddit acquaintance and say hi to my cat please.  
Saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù just doesn‚Äôt feel like enough, but I don‚Äôt know what else to say.  Where are you located? (Country/state) Feel free to message me (25 F) anytime for a friend! ‚ù§Ô∏è  
I know this situation is terrible, but your user name is hilarious in context. Your ability to inject humor, and therefore levity into mortality is inspiration for anyone to make the most of their time. Thanks for what it is worth.  
Can I brighten your day with a care package? Send me a DM and I will gladly be your january secret santa .  
Not a question but i want to suggest the book Elsewhere, by Gabrielle Zevin. You answered earlier that you like to read, and that you're wondering about if there's an afterlife. You'd like this book  
I love this book. The monologue where she talks about life‚Äôs moments being strung together like pearls is the most beautiful passage I‚Äôve ever read.  
https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/56091-there-will-be-other-lives-there-will-be-other-lives I had to look it up I was very curious and then was not let down. Posting link if anyone else is curious  
STOP STOP. I was JUST thinking about this book last night and couldn‚Äôt remember the name. I was going to post on that sub that helps you find names of books and stuff. Weird coincidence that I couldn‚Äôt just scroll past.  
My best friend passed from leukemia like 10 years ago, he was always in such a great spirit even until the last day.  Make sure you do your best (I know its tough) to stay in good spirits and have as much fun as you can.  Its shitty that covid is happening because honestly we had some really fun times together while he was sick and they're memories I'll never forget.  It's so sad reading your post and knowing how people that love you feel right now, and how scared you must be.  I remember my friend telling me "if I pass away I want you to be the strong one and have fun with the boys at the service"(some of our friends live on the other side of the country). So that's what we did had one crazy week together in honour of him when he passed.  Anyways I'm so sorry about you having to go through this, and I hope you get to have a ton of good times before you go!  I know I didnt ask you anything but if you ever need to talk feel free! Also your bf sounds great!  
There are studies done on people in end of life stage with psychedelics. To better come to terms with the inevitable. Might be totally wrong thing for you but thought I mention it anyway.  
Can I order some Chinese food from your fave spot for you?  
You have a very kind heart. Take my free award, I wish I could give more.  
12 Awards are ready, with 120 more well on the way  
Thanks so much for this ‚ù§Ô∏è  
Your post restores my faith with humanity  
Happy to contribute as well. DM me if OP takes you up on this.  
Sadly she hasn‚Äôt taken me up on it yet but if she pops up in my dm‚Äôs I‚Äôll let you know and we‚Äôll get her a big ol‚Äô feast with tons of leftovers ü§§  
Not really a question but if you ever need someone to just vent to who will never judge and say any feeling you might not want to share with those you are close with you can message me. Happy or angry or bitter or just random you can send me it. Also might I suggest buying your boyfriend something absolutely random and hilarious that can remind him of you that he just keeps forever that just shows your spirit to him even years to come. Do the same for your best friend. Nothing expensive or even useful. Just random as crap. Write a letter to them too to go along with it and wrap them up for when you are gone to truly make it sentimental and describe why you chose this. If you need some cash to do this I‚Äôll send you PayPal. If there‚Äôs no afterlife you can still live on with those you love. On top of all this can you share with me your favorite book. I don‚Äôt know you but I‚Äôd love to read it and think of you from time to time just to know you aren‚Äôt forgotten. You may not get your party but you can still use this time to have fun in knowing you are leaving something behind. Take random pictures and actually print them out for those you love. Goofy faces and just whatever you feel. Something that shows your personality. Hell you can even put together a picture slideshow that you ask to be played at your funeral that will be remembered forever and make it fun to make sure people smile and even laugh and take away from the sadness they will feel. Right now is a good time for you to leave your mark to help them cope. Give those special to you something to look back on and smile and you will truly live on with them. Use your time to really live. Don‚Äôt hold anything back. Might I suggest a weekend full of just doing anything absolutely random with your boyfriend. Something you plan out for you guys so you are doing some things you‚Äôd really like to do before you go that he can look back on and remember. It doesn‚Äôt have to be anything big. Also buy your mother a crazy weird random and hilarious keychain for her keys. Something super ridiculous. Something she has to explain and smile about but will see every single day. Just some ideas to touch those in your life and still shine through when you are gone. It could be really fun for you. Hell you can still plan a living funeral requiring masks and 6 feet apart and make it fun and memorable. I think if it were me I‚Äôd get everyone together to do something creative that they can all exchange. Like maybe paint a portrait of you. Then do a random exchange and everyone has some kindergarten looking print of you they can laugh at and keep. Maybe a picture of you and a boyfriend. It creates a moment where you can show off everyone‚Äôs work and laugh about them but makes for a huge memory on everyone‚Äôs part. I wish I knew you because this is the exact type of event I‚Äôd plan for you. Something not sad and somber but full of laughs.  
What advice do you have for a father of daughters getting into middle school and then high school? I welcome any wisdom and insight you can share. I wish you peace and comfort. Edit: misspelling  
I‚Äôm sorry this is happening to you. Have you ever gone sky diving? It‚Äôs amazing. I love this story, also. If you have a minute, check it out. the Egg ~ Andy Weir. I like to think about life this way.  
I'm curious if you have taken on new experiences since your diagnosis?  People often talk about 'this is the time to go skydiving' or 'This is the time to start doing heroin'. How real is this? If so, the experiences you've chosen to have and if you feel like it's been a good thing?  
Im so very sorry...I can't even imagine how you may be feeling and how isolated you now are due to this virus...do you have a huge regret? Or a wish to do before you go?  Again I am so sorry about this...I'd like to..I dunno write you or something?  
What is your favourite movie or your favourite book?  
I admire you soo much and I hope nothing but the best for you.  
It's been 5 months since this was posted. I hope you lived the best 6 months.  Love, from a stranger from other side of the world.  
Are you dead yet?  
Without giving too much in the way of personal details, what are the three best things you've done (travelling, achievements etc.)?  
Nothing to ask to you mysterious stranger, but: May your passage to whatever lies beyond be one of as little pain possible. We may not know each other, nor do we have any ties of any type, but enjoy your time left and make each second exponentially better than the last. Although I don't know you, and our paths like never crossed, I wish you peaceful rest through both summer's heat and winter's frost. Someday we may meet somewhere amongst the star. Safe travels, and fair winds, you travel into the great unknown with a bright eye and a bushy tail, it's the nature of things as you are forged from the dust of stars and to the stars all things must return. So fear not what lies ahead, it's yet another adventure, not something to dread. So farewell stranger though we my have never met, remember to not spend a single second in regret.  
It may seem pointless to respond to this thread seeing as it's been just under a year since it was posted, but I'll be thinking of her today. I can only imagine how much she is missed by her family and friends. Please hug someone you love today.  
Just stumbled across this post today , I realize you‚Äôre likely gone. I hope you had some good times before you passed and I hope whatever you hoped for after came true.  
it makes me sad that someone that seems like a nice person is gonna leave us :(  
Can we be friends??? Cn I please send you something for a a lil happiness? Pleaseeee? Also, I‚Äôve read on here something of a parable about a man who died and it was so awesome and now I need to find it because I want to send it to you. It made me feel so good about the unknown. I also believe in an afterlife but this particular piece was not just about an afterlife but and entire other way thinking. I‚Äôm going to go and look for it!  Can you please let me send you some thing for Chinese food or a comedy skit that has a cost or just your cash app? I am a little older than you are and I remember being your age and I just want to do something nice for someone who is as strong as you are. I‚Äôm so sorry you didn‚Äôt get to have friends and family come over.  
My best friend died a month ago from cancer. She had a death doula who made the whole experience a lot easier for her. For instance, her doula organized all her last (socially distanced) visits from friends, so there was no overlapping, coordinated with her doctors about her pain control, found therapists for her kids, let people know when she needed what. All this so that she could concentrate on just being alive with whoever was with her and not wasting time organizing stuff and answering endless well meaning texts. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs something your family can afford but I wanted to put that out there.  Also, she wasn‚Äôt religious. But she had vision (she wasn‚Äôt on any drugs and it was very unexpected, she was a very logical and pragmatic person) a few years ago that convinced her that our time here on earth in our bodies is just a tiny blink in our existence. She basically closed her eyes while lying down and went through a tunnel and into the bodies of different animals, jumped into a fire and went up into the sky as embers, and became a jellyfish in the stars.  Then her kids called her back to earth. She would cry when she told the story because it was too beautiful for her to convey with words. I‚Äôm not religious either, but her experience has made me question what we perceive as reality. Also her friend made her a bowl filled with little clay coins with jellyfish on them, and she gave one to everyone when they would visit. I‚Äôm sorry this is the hand you were dealt. The world is terrible and wonderful. (I can help you think of mementos to give out if you‚Äôre interested)  
Cats or dogs?  
What‚Äôs the first book you read and instantly fell in love with?    What‚Äôs your favorite cartoon as a kid?    What‚Äôs your favorite memory of you and your dad?    What‚Äôs your favorite memory of you and your mom?     What‚Äôs your favorite memory of you and each of your grandparents?    What‚Äôs the first song you remember?     If you could fly to any part of the world what would it NOT be?    If you could have one terminal disease that wasn‚Äôt leukemia, what would it be?    Peeps or chocolate bunnies?    Have you ever had Carne Asada Fries?    Have you ever had Poutine?     Have you ever drank alcohol?     Have you ever skydived?      Have you ever broken a bone?    What‚Äôs your favorite color?     If you had to pick a Monet painting, which one would you like? Everyone loves you, they will hurt for a while, but they will definitely remember you as an amazing woman. An amazing Daughter and an amazing friend. It‚Äôs okay to leave and your time is when it is. However, it suck. Think if it this way, at least you don‚Äôt die of a broken hip in the cold from slipping! Old people die of crappy things like bad memory and balance. But sometimes that‚Äôs not much better. Basically I‚Äôm saying that you are gonna be a champ at going out. No wimper in the night. You got to be bright and dim fast. Not smolder. You will forever touch my heart internet stranger.  
‚ÄùDo not put off until tommorow, What can be done today‚Äù  
Is there anything we can do on your behalf? Plant a tree, a book you‚Äôd love for everyone to read, something like that?  
Life has a way of making you realize that the only true currency we have is our time.  What is your favourite food that you ordered?  And, what is the most romantic way to eat it?  
I was just curious is it cancer? I was diagnosed with stage four testicular cancer when i was 23 that was just over 27 years ago then i found out that now i have leukemia caused by the chemotherapy i went through over 25 years ago anc the doctor wanted me to start chemotherapy again right away that was just over two years ago well i made a choice im am not going through the hell of chemotherapy again I will be 51 next month and really dont know if i will make to 52 but i am ok with it like you i am not afraid of dying and i am so tired of doctors hospitals and surgeries I've had enough no more a lot of people can't understand why i have chosen not to go through treatment but if they have gone through what i have hone through half of what i have been through in the last 27+ years they would probably understand then i hope you can get the best out of the time you have left that's what i have been trying to do  
I got a story to share that reminds me of such a moment and perhaps it can help give thought.  Back in high school, roughly 11 years ago, I had a classmate that went around asking all the teachers if there was any extra credit or homework projects she can do. I don't quite remember her name because I didn't talk to her that much and we just didn't share the sane circle of friends. And then one day our chemistry teacher came to read outloud a note. And it was from her, she passed away the day before from illness.   It just hit me weird that of all things she wanted to do more homework despite that she wasn't going to make graduation.  Just wanted to share it with you while the window is still open. I don't know, don't really know you but it hits a weird spot. Doubt I'll get to know you more than I could in a couple months but at least just a little is fine.  
I know you probably have lots of people to talk to, but I'm 23 with heart failure so if you ever want to talk feel free to message me  
This was a year ago and I just hope her end of life moments were without pain.  
I have a ton of questions actually! they're more so simpleton questions out of curiousity (: (1) do you currently donate to charity? if so, what charities? (2) tea or coffee? (3) are you a fan of sushi? (4) what type of music are you into? do you have a spotify playlist? if not, here's my main one (please ignore all the anime music)! (5) are you with someone? how are they coping? how are your family coping? (6) what have you done to ‚Äôexperience life‚Äô? like, per say, sky diving, trampolining, parachuting, a hot air ballong & so on. (7) how are you right now? are you okay?  
Question coming, but a little preface. My friend passed from leukemia at 27. It was devastating, but I still think of him often and know I am a better person because of him. I am a better person because I chose to act more like him in the ways I thought made him amazing.  So, I ask: what is something you do that you feel more people could do? Something we can carry on in your name. What it is doesn't really matter, so long as it comes from you. Looking forward to your reply and wishing you and yours every possible positivity in this challenging time. My fingers are crossed that there is an afterlife waiting for you ‚ù§Ô∏èü§û  
I'm so sorry for the hand you've been dealt. A few years ago, I lost my cousin to aggressive cancer. She turned 21 the day before she was diagnosed, and passed a week before her 22nd. Towards the end, my Uncle and Aunt didn't tell her she was close or that the doctors had given her a two week time frame. They kept feeding her false hope. It broke my heart that she wasn't given a chance at closure or to have important conversations because she wasn't encouraged to address her mortality. I guess my question is this; would you rather not know how long you have left? Do you think it would make it easier?  
This may be kind of morbid but are you still alive?  
I may be repeating this but I haven't seen it asked yet, likely because it may be too personal, but I'm genuinely curious. When you say "good quality of life" for at least 6 months, does that mean you will likely have to suffer near the end? If so, what are your options (legally/personally) to reduce any worsening symptoms or simply stop suffering? I'm very sorry that came out so bluntly but I dont know how else to ask. I ask because everyone dies someday... so when you truly have to face the facts, what are your realistic options?  
Is there anything at all a stranger from a tiny country in the middle east can do to make your day better? I would love to put a smile on your face any way I can. 2020 has been a bad year for me, and for most of us. However, reading your post has made me realize that there is no such thing as a "bad year" as long as we are healthy. I'm so sorry to hear that, you are so young and you seem to be full of life based on your answers. I really wish there was any way at all to make you feel better. Please let me know.  
I assume you had to cancel because of COVID? You should definitely still have that party and invite all your friends on zoom while you enjoy the foods.  Have them each bring something to eat or drink on camera so they can SORT OF participate in the treats. It won‚Äôt be quite the same but it‚Äôll still be good and it would suck to not be able to get everyone together at all! This was more a comment than a question. I guess my question would be WHY NOT DO THAT?  
Do you like any games? :) if you don‚Äôt know much about them, I have a bunch of cooperative games you can play online with friends to suggest  
I'm so sorry you have to go through this life can be unfair to most at times and no one's fully prepared but as you make your peace make sure that you make a video to your SO (text could work but video or in-person is best) to thank him for the time you had with him and give him your blessing to move on it might not be your first train of thought but it would mean so much to him  
I never post anything, and I read you're not religious. I'm not either. But I'll pray for you. And I just hope you have the best 6 months of your life! I hope you get to do most of the things you've wanted, and know that by reading this post you've a spot in my heart. Won't forget you even if I don't even know you. Much blessings to you and your boyfriend ‚ù§  
I'm so sorry about all this, no one should have such a short time on earth.  You mentioned you had a boyfriend. How you two are handling things? Are you afraid that he will forget you, or at the opposite that will be depressed and afraid to commit with someone else after you pass away?  In a similar way, do you actively prepare the "after" with your close circle? Like telling them everything's gonna okay, and that at some point after your passing they should move on? I can't imagine how hard it'll be for your parents to go on.  
What is  your current favorite: Song/album? Book? Show? Movie? So we can all think of you when we see them!  
If you don't already know, you have and will continue to have a lasting and meaningful impact on peoples lives. Some you know, but thanks to this, many you may never know. You're actively doing what you can to help your friends and family handle what's to come, not everyone will really get it, but eventually they will.  
Can I virtually give you a hug?  
I hope the last months of your life are filled with love and happiness. I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that you are dying.  Whatever the afterlife holds, I hope it treats you well. Don‚Äôt really have a question, I just wanted to say something. Posts like this hurt, and I don‚Äôt want people to suffer in their last moments.  
What type of burial have you got planned out? Do you plan on giving any parts to science or would you prefer everything to stay in tact?  Also, in your 20 years of living, what's the funniest thing you've seen/heard?  God bless you my dude, I hope your going is painless and how you want it to be x

Do you have the mentality of a seven year old or like an 19 year old  
No I have a mentality of a 19 year old like I know who I am and everything about me,  when my ‚Äúfamily‚Äù came in started asking me a bunch of questions like (are you ok?) (how are you doing?) I was kind of confused and asked the doctor if my grandma was around or if she‚Äôs coming to get me out of here so he told me to explain when I did everyone was confused when I told them my grandma dropped me of at a bakery store a while ago, only my twin brother realized and explained to them then told me that happened when we were 7 and my grandma had passed away 2 years ago.  I‚Äôm not sure if that answers your question sorry  
Were you and your family frightened when you realized that you had lost your memory?  
I don‚Äôt think so but it did make things even worse and harder for them I guess, I commented on another question how they are now if you want to know more sorry I don‚Äôt feel like typing everything again all over üòÖ  
So you have a twin? Did you recognize their face? What was that like?  
How do your friends and family feel and how are they coping?  
I‚Äôm not sure but my twin brother always seems at the verge of crying you can literally hear his voice cracking each time he tries to speak and my mom always cries all the time, my dad he seems a bit off for some reason my boyfriend is tired he stays with me all day long then goes back to only get three hours of sleep to wake up for his classes. So yeah everything seems a bit out of place and it‚Äôs making me feel like it‚Äôs all my fault  
It's not your fault and I'm sure no one actually blames u, you're all just stuck in the same unfortunate situation. I know it wont mean much coming from a stranger on the internet but things will get better for u.  
Tell your boyfriend and twin to get a playlist of your favourite songs (not just current favourites) and play them to you. It's anecdotally good for memory recovery, not necessarily in your position.  
How do you feel about your boyfriend if you technically don‚Äôt really know him right now?  
Honestly this part sounds like a wattpad story in the making. The most important question. Do you still love him even if you don't technically remember him!? In all seriousness, hope you get better soon. 2020 has been fuckall so I'm sure you haven't missed anything significant.  
Don‚Äôt answer if this is too weird and personal, but how is it to have a boyfriend with no memory of him? I feel like that would be especially strange and hard to adjust to  
Do you still have feelings for your boyfriend? Or do you view him as a friendly stranger now?  
Have feelings for him that‚Äôs a really hard one to answer but I do like him that‚Äôs for sure since he‚Äôs really supportive and funny and always makes things seem like they‚Äôre ok and are going to be ok I think he‚Äôs the only one taking this good and making things seem less awkward and more comfortable for me  
Was he good to you before this? Ask your family, brother, your friends how he treated you. If he was bad, the last thing you need is to be stuck in a relationship with a bad person because you feel indebted to them.  Although to me, he sounds like a wonderful guy.  
I really hope things work out between you and your boyfriend  
Seems like you picked him for a reason, I‚Äôm glad he is making this easier for you.  
Do they expect you‚Äôll regain your memory at some point? Sorry if you can‚Äôt remember what they told you.  
Yeah well my doctor said it was normal for this to happen, and he said that my memory could come back or it won‚Äôt it depends on my brain and how much oxygen it lacked during the surgery but he said it might be after a week or maybe 35 years and maybe never.   Sorry if I made it long üòÖ  
Save your sorry, it‚Äôs all good!! Best of luck to you.  
"it will come back or it won't"  And you choose to continue to pay this man for his analysis?  
Did you get any memory‚Äôs back yet?  
What grad level education do you have? Are you at 2nd grade or do you have all it through high school?  
Oh that I‚Äôm not sure of, but I do have an appointment in 2 weeks to get tested out and see what I know and what I don‚Äôt, what I‚Äôm capable of and what I‚Äôm not but apparently right now I‚Äôm in my last year of high school but I probably will miss the first three to four months of school  
I graduate this June! If you need help with school work, shoot me a PM! I'm 18F and speak english, french and some spanish :)  
Please update us in 2 weeks! Sending my love, hope your recovery goes well  
Are you feeling very anxious? Scared? Do  old songs you like seem familiar?  
I am kind of scared also maybe a bit anxious, and I‚Äôm not sure I remember any old songs I used to listen to or even if I did listen to songs and I haven‚Äôt listened to a song recently because I literally just got out of surgery 5 days ago  
When my friend went through something similar,  it helped when her sister and  boyfriend played her favorite music. Maybe that would help you also!  
What‚Äôs the most interesting thing you remember?  
The only thing I remember is my grandma taking me to a bakery to buy cupcakes because she baked a pie at home and we thought cupcakes would go well with them I remember hitting the door of the baker but nothing after it but my twin brother said that happened when we were 7 and my grandma passed away 2 years ago apparently  
Hmmmmm. What events have you been told about in which you participated? (This can range from significant or insignificant thing.)  
Not sure I could imagine anything more scary if I tried! Do you recognise faces and voices or is essentially everything lost?  
I don‚Äôt recognize faces, but if I hear a voice I get a weird sensation that I‚Äôve heard the voice before but I don‚Äôt know where  
Do u r recognize family like your parents  
How was it meeting your parents again? How did your friends react? Do you have a girl/boyfriend and if so how did they react?  
It was confusing my friends I only had one and they‚Äôre ok I guess I have a boyfriend he‚Äôs really supportive but I he did cry with my brother on the first day when I told him I didn‚Äôt recognize him it‚Äôs been 5 day since I cam out of surgery btw  
Last thing you remember and how is your memory now!  
Last thing I remember was when I was 7 and my grandma dropped me off at a bakery to buy cupcakes, I can‚Äôt really judge my memory now ‚Äòcause I just got out of surgery 5 days ago  
Oh dayum, so this is recent! So, another question if you don‚Äôt mind: What are some tips to help someone with memory loss?  
Uhh I guess prepare yourself for the worst lol and just be ready for anything you‚Äôll be told. You can ask as many questions I don‚Äôt mind  
Listen to music you love, if your forget what you love, just go through whatever you have saved. Hopefully it can trigger some memories as people tend to associate certain songs with moments.

Are you able to continue going to university since you have just had knowledge like 7 years old boy?  
Not op, but with amnesia you remember everything you‚Äôve learned. Your brain store‚Äôs information and knowledge in a separate part of the brain than that of memories. They actually did a study a while ago with someone who has anterograde amnesia (which means the person can‚Äôt make any more memories and their memory resets every so often in a pattern) and the person was given a maze to complete. Each time he took it they‚Äôd ask if he has completed the maze before, obviously he doesn‚Äôt remember and says no. Each time he completed the maze he got faster and better at it until he could complete it in a few seconds. He doesn‚Äôt have the memories of the maze, but the knowledge of what to do is still there.  
It's called procedural memory, fyi.  
If this really is the last thing you remember a lot has happened in 12 years. Check out this game called Minecraft when you're able to; it's essentially legos but on meth and it's become the best selling game of all time. Stay strong lad.  
Not the same pathology, but I had amnesia from a severe concussion that lasted several weeks. Things slowly came back to me except some random memories here and there. It definitely took a while. I hope things work out similarly for you, but if not, you got this. And good luck!  
Did you remember Reddit or did you just discover it after your surgery?  
No I had it installed on my phone and my boyfriend helped me make an account and post about my story here and answer questions to help pass time till he comes back and visits after his college classes I just got out of surgery 5 days ago if that make things more clear  
I can imagine what the answer will be but anyway, just in case, did you also forgot all your passwords?  
you had reddit on your phone without account??  
Is it complete amnesia, or more of a dissociated type of amnesia?  
That I‚Äôm not sure of or any of my doctors I‚Äôm getting tested in 2 weeks because I just got out of surgery 5 days ago and I can barely move a muscle  
I see, guess to rephrase my sentence, is your memory foggy but that you can sort of remember? or is it like it never happened, and you are hearing of a story about yourself?  
It‚Äôs like nothing ever happened, and I‚Äôm hearing a story about myself I guess? I‚Äôm not sure if that answers your question, sorry English isn‚Äôt my first language  
What's your honest opinion about what you have heard of yourself?  
Wait so what about the memories of learning English? Like some weird words or words you learned in a weird way. Do they just exist now with no backstory? Queue Doge Sorry this is interesting af. I remember asking my English teacher what "ajar" meant and she didn't know.  
Holdup there. So, perfect writing in a language that is not your first language just days after?! Thank god/universe that your skills are there  
Do you remember the memories you‚Äôve had with your friends or anything about them  
How would you describe waking up to realize you had no memory? What could you remember?  
I didn‚Äôt realize I had no memory until later on but I was pretty scared and terrified, and I remember going to a baker with my grandma to buy cupcakes if you read the comments you‚Äôll get a bit more of a visual of what I‚Äôm trying to say  
I can't imagine how difficult this must be, thank you for sharing your story with everyone. Please create.. music, art, poetry, anything. I feel like you could tap into some immensely powerful emotions and thoughts, which may seem like nonsense to you at the time, but could be rather therapeutic (for you) and illuminating (for those  you share with).  
Bright side ? You can play all the awsome and games and watch movies and read books once again !  
No bright side yet, I‚Äôm still in so much pain and I‚Äôm scared to eat I can barely move anything without feeling pain but I guess I am still thankful that I‚Äôm not in a much worse case.  
Its all temporary right ?  
You seem like you can write well, do you have any issues like that such as forgetting grammar spelling, or words?  
There are two different types of memory. The one that recognizes faces, events and what we generally call memory and memory that helps you write, walk, talk and other different stuff. If someone who was good at painting and picks it up after losing his memory he will be good within a matter of time.  
Are you still in the hospital or are you already home? If you are still in the hospital, maybe your memory will gradually return when you return to your room. I saw that some people have already suggested that you listen to music. Just don't demand too much of yourself right now, give your brain some time to relax. In the end, everything will be fine again, no matter how uncomfortable it is now. And one thing to know about Reddit: there will always be people here to cheer you up and support you.  
What surgery did you have exactly? Was your heart broken? üíî  
If your memory doesn't come back and you discover you made something your "new" don't like (like cheating on a test, or a gf/bf) what would you do?  
I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm trying to focus on now and recovering and if I did cheat on my boyfriend I would probably tell him because he‚Äôs the one who‚Äôs been the most supportive right now  
So are you a completely different person now or are you the same, according to parents, relatives, etc?  
Has anyone told you how...interesting this year has been so far?  
I was about to say how you remembered your reddit account but this account was made today lol  
Was your parents aware that this could be a side effect prior to the surgery or were they blindsided by it?  
Did you lose knowledge learned in school?! Like you said your last memory was when you were 7, like  62 = ?  
Hey man! Wish u all the best in ur recovery!!  As you‚Äôve said it gets lonely in the hospital and there‚Äôs not much stuff to do here‚Äôs a list off the top of my mind I‚Äôve come up with that you can do! I am also 18 almost 19 and these things are some of the things I enjoyüëçüèª You can watch some movies, Some great movies are The Marvel Series maybe Star Wars or Star Trek (sci-fi)/ James Bond, Jason Bourne, kingsman and mission imposible are also some great action movies! / also some cartoon style movies that I also enjoy are Spider-Man into the spiderverse, Wreck it Ralph or Gnomeo and Juliet. These are very light hearted movies that will put you in a good mood and keep you entertained!  Also some platforms where you can find these movies might be Netflix, HBO OR Disney+ but they are paid subscription model meaning you have to pay to have these platforms. And there are some great series in there as well! I for one don‚Äôt watch that many series but I‚Äôm sure people in your surrounding will probably know some. But if you don‚Äôt have access these, don‚Äôt worry there are other places that are entertaining and free, such an example is YouTube or twitch where you can see from documentaries to people playing games! Another great way to pass the time is with video games! In the hospital there might not be any place for a console ( where a lot of games are played and is usually hooked up to a tv) but you can download games on your phone (some intresting ones are clash of clans or asphalt 9) or maybe ask if you have a portable device such as a Nintendo, psp or a laptop to play games on. (Minecraft of Zelda breath of the wild are some great games). That‚Äôs not all, book too are incredible if you like reading, some great ones I suggest would be Harry Potter, the Percy Jackson universe books or if you like horror check out Stephen kings books( I haven‚Äôt had the courage to read the last one). Also if you have a visitor and want to enjoy yourself with them cause it might get a little awkward, board games and cards are good fun and time consuming. so a good way of getting yourself out of a situation where you don‚Äôt know what to talk about, start a game and you‚Äôll be cracking up with it and having good fun some classics are settlers of Cat√°n, monopoly or risk. Also if you want to keep up with the news and such I suggest you get some social media if you don‚Äôt have it already: instagram, Twitter  and well.. reddit! Speedy recovery and all the luck, I also suggest that more people put a comment down below with things you enjoy as I‚Äôll have missed and not even thought about a lot of things. Best wishes from a fellow 18 towards old!  
oh god that's terrifying. I'm 19 and i have heart surgery in 8 days.  
You made your account today? Why did you name yourself ‚Äústarflight-?‚Äù  
Did you forget that it was actually a brain surgery?  
I heard the memory loss wears off in weeks or months. Did the docs tell you anything ?  
So how did you handle it? were you overwhelmed by how much moments you've lost and couldn't remember now?  
Does it feel like time travel?  I ways imagine, what if I'm sitting on my couch now, but a few days from now I get into a bad accident and forget everything up until this point. Would it feel like a blip in time?  
I lost a good chunk of my memory a little over a year ago.  For me it was like that feeling when you wake up and you don‚Äôt remember how you got there.  Like when your young and fall asleep in the car on vacation and your parents carry you to bed in a motel room.  You realize that things don‚Äôt add up, so your mind starts trying to trace back the events if that makes sense.  But you don‚Äôt immediately understand exactly how much you don‚Äôt know.  So as far as traveling through time yes.  More like being knocked out and kidnapped by a time traveler lol.  It is incredibly strange and was very overwhelming for me but I‚Äôm much older than op.  Have a kid, had a career, had friends and in my mind the timeline was 2ish years off.  2 years of memory was just gone and the 3 years prior to that was spotty.  So 5 years of memory affected total. Really strange having your 8 year old telling you things you did.  To have memories of the both of you that you no longer have.  The worst part, for me, is trying to talk to people about things I know I am knowledgeable about or was knowledgeable about and forgetting the terms.  Because my memory is hazy.  But I can still sit down and do the things just fine.   I‚Äôve basically just become an introvert because things are still so overwhelming for me.  It‚Äôs very hard trying to explain to people you just lost your memory.  The whole Covid thing has been a convenient excuse too not interact with people too lol.  Just really strange and scary thinking about going back to ‚Äònormal‚Äô life when your version of ‚Äònormal‚Äô is gone.  You don‚Äôt just lose time, you lose your identity.  A part of yourself is gone.  Even if though I don‚Äôt remember what I lost, it‚Äôs a fact.  And the more you surround yourself with people you knew the more you are made aware of how much you lost.  That‚Äôs just my version though.  I hope it is easier for OP. Sorry for the long answer to your question, not trying to jack op‚Äôs post.  This is literally the most I have talked about what happened/is happening.  
what is the most simple thing you forgot about ?  
Do you know about Covid-19??? The schools were closed for a few months all over the world  
How long was your brain lacking oxygen while in surgery?  
Typical Cabg sx is about 4 hrs or less (depending on the surgeon) however anoxic injuries are a normal risk. I've never seen it in a young person though. In CVICU we call it "pump head"  
How did u find reddit  
Oh shit, I'm going in for surgery hopefully this year and I'm 15. Do you know the specific surgery you received, or the heart condition it rectified? For me I have Tetralogy of Fallot and this will be my second surgery, if I'm not mistaken to replace the pulmonary valve. Some other questions I have: do you have the same vocabulary as you did when you last remember? How's the surgery recovery, other than the memory loss? What was your first reaction when you woke up?  Have an excellent day :)  
How can you tell if people are telling you the truth pertaining to your relation to them or what happened in the past?  
How are you feeling today?  
What kind of heart surgery did you get?  
Wow. I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through this, and thank you for taking the time to answer questions.  I saw you say before English isn‚Äôt your first language. Do you remember your first language?  I hope you plan on posting updates!!!  
Do you remember your grandma?  
The smart ass in me wants to ask what you had for dinner last night. But the honest question is, are you coping ok? I've lost a few days in my life and they bother me constantly. I can't even imagine waking up and not remembering a thing.  
did you hope you had a girlfriend?  
So drinks don‚Äôt bring back the memories?  
No question, I just wanted to wish you the best for your recovery!  
How did your friends react when they knew u lost your memory?  
I‚Äôve been reading the answers, and the best analogy I can think of is; if your life was was show, you got all your previous episodes deleted, bit still have all your character development. Would you say that‚Äôs accurate? I don‚Äôt know much about it.  
What are you doing here?  
Do you have trouble recalling the events that have happened since your surgery? Are you forming new memories easily or are you having to be told what you did yesterday or an hour ago?  
What about your ability to use smartphone/computer??? Are you familiar with it? Or feel really awkward? Can you still ride a bicycle?  
When are you going to pay me back that $50 you still owe me?  
Has anyone commented on your personality changing? Also do you see yourself as a different person to before you post your memory?  
Is it difficult to type or automatic? Are you using a phone to answer?  
Who was your middle school crush ?  
What all did you forget? Like was it a case of perfect amnesia or did you only forget certain things?  
Did you forget your loved ones? Any skills ? Education level? Btw you should watch the joker, the dark knight movies, Braking bad ,but never watch game of thrones u lucky motherfucker  
I cant wait until some girl comes up and says *hi honey the baby is coming tomorrow" and you lost your memory tell if it happened I need to know  
Have you tried turning it off and back on again?  (SRSLY, I'm sorry for your loss)  
What country do you live in? Is the coronavirus still present where you are?  
[deleted]  
How did you learn about Reddit?  What made you do this ama?  How long will you have to stay in the hospital?  Do you know if you have any pets at home?  Do you still find your boyfriend attractive?  Which country are you from?  Was your phone locked? If yes, did you remember how to unlock it? Did you remember how to use a phone? Sorry about the amount of questions, I'm s very curious person üòÖ  
What's the weirdest thing about it? And how do you remember english so fluently? Do you remember friends and family? I'm so sorry for so many questions I just find this really intriguing  
What is the first thing you want to do when you get out of the hospital?  
Do you like the same things you used to like before you lost your memory or have your interests changed?  
Are you sure you're not a 19 year old who lost his heart after memory surgery? How can you be sure?  
So what memory is lost (i know it sounds dumb), is it people? Places? Academic/education things, foods?  
While this thread isn't a bad pastime, you should do something that takes your mind off your condition as well. If I may recommend some things to watch, if you have any interest in movies and TV: Star Wars. Basically a modern mythology. Exciting fantasy sci-fi film series with emperors, laser swords, and space ship chases. You probably saw it before, so you may as well watch it now. (Pro tip: the best viewing order is 4-5-1-2-3-6. And then 7-8-9 if you want.) Lord of the Rings. Originally a long fantasy epic novel that became the basis of fantasy as we know it, but nobody expects you to read the books. Just watch the movies, they're fantastic and just as much a cultural icon. (See if your family can find the Extended Editions, that's the best way to watch.) Avatar: the Last Airbender. Asian-inspired fantasy animated series on Netflix. Incredible storytelling for a kid's show. One of the most highly regarded animated shows (or even just shows) of our time. The Marvel Cinematic Universe. Loosely based on the Marvel superhero comics, this is a collection of films set in the same universe filled with super heroes. Pretty much the biggest film franchise in existence right now.

How do you remember how to use reddit and the internet?  
Do the doctors have any kind of explanation for your condition? Get better soon!  
You should look through your picture camera roll to help you piece some memories together, as well as your friends and family‚Äôs social media etc. good luck! I imagine it is a very bizarre feeling Do you remember what you wanted to be in the future? Or what you wanted to study?  
When did you realize you were missing some memories??  
What have you heard of 2020 so far?  
Not a question, but I wish you the best :)  
Any update?? How is your memory?  
If it's not too much trouble, will you keep posting here and sharing your experience as the days go by? I'm hoping you recover well in any case and take each day easy. Thank you for sharing.  
Did you still have the ability to speak English? Or was it just the who you are/where you come from etc.?  
I think you mentioned a significant other somewhere. Do you have feelings for this person?  
Do you still have basic knowledge like you don't remember ur mum but you know what a mother is  
How do you know those are your real parents and you truly had a heart surgery?  
What‚Äôs the first thing you would like to do/eat/drink when you get out of hospital?  
Maybe you discover you have a girlfriend  
Hi OP, good luck for all. Hope you can update us few months later! Be strong  
do you remember things such as social media or electronics? do you remember worldly events? and also do you remember how to do standard tasks that people have to learn, like driving or riding a bike or brushing your teeth? sorry if any of these are repeat questions haha  
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. I don't really have anything to ask, I just.. I'm sorry. I hope everything works out for you and your family.  
do you still have one bit of old memory still there in your mind? or is it all completely gone?  
How do you feel interacting with your family? Are you comfortable with them or is it awkward? Is there a sense of familiarity?  
How did it feel to find out that you have a twin?  
[removed]  
I‚Äôm your dad son. Do you remember me?  
[deleted]  
is your memory still lost or better?  
Sorry for your loss. If you had a hobby or skill, does this mean you‚Äôd have to relearn it?  
Were you shocked to see the way you looked since you it not 7 anymore?  
How much of it did u lose?  
I know from reading the comments that you were gay or bi before the surgery, do you "feel" that your sexuality has changed/will change now after the surgery? Or when you woke up did you already know that you are gay/bi?  
Do you feel like or has anyone told you your personality has changed from when you were 7? Also, I'm sorry for your situation and I hope everything gets better for you :)  
Are you going to sue? You could probably get a lot of money out of the ordeal  
How do u know english?  
How i hope your memory comes back asap. But till then. Ask someone what was your favourite music and TV show and things like that. Maybe thatwill help or atleast you can listen /watch it again and maybe you will have the same extasy of it again. Then when your memory comes back you will have the fall in love for the second time with the same song feeling 4ever. :D  
do you remember stuff like math but just have no memory of learning it?  
I read you have a boyfriend, is he cute? Is he someone you would have imagined yourself with?  
How do you feel about those who you were close to? How bout the stuff you liked your what you thought? Os that with you?  
How did you learn about this website, and learn to register an account, and the meaning of AMA?  
What do u remember? If anything?  
Do you feel like you lost your memories but had some prior? Or does it just feel like starting a new chain of memories? Sorry if i worded it badly  
Hi there, I hope you feel better soon, physically and mentally. You will get through this, many others have. I can't imagine how strange it must feel now, though, or how anxious you are. Just know that thousands of people around the world are rooting for you, thinking of you and sending you good vibes today. So, my question: do you remember the past 5 days just fine? I'm sorry if this has been asked before. I wish you the best of luck.  
Do you remember what you learned in school (Mathematics, sciences, history,...)? I am guessing that you live in Japan since you said it was your first language, so do you remember anything about the actual country? You seem to remember English (likely a skill learned at school) so I am curious about other things you would have learned at school. I am sorry for what you are going through and wish you to get much better soon.  
How does a heart surgery affect the brain? Add the answer in an edit.  
Lack of oxygen. Cabg surgery involves cross clamping the aorta and diverting the blood flow.... Look up perfusion. Not all cabgs are done this way though, and that is referred to as "off pump" Edit: auto correct  
I've lost my memory in the past as well and i was wondering what it felt like the moment you woke up? Was your memory completely gone? Or did you still know what was going on and eventually realized you had forgotten some things? I lost mine after a seizure while i was high and although it slowly started coming back after a few minutes it was an absolute trip at the time.  
What has been your default feeling most of the time? Anxious? Scared? Calm? Curious? Apathetic?  
Do you know exactly why you had to have heart surgery? Also, you said you have a boyfriend. I'm assuming you don't remember much about him. How do you feel towards him? Do you think there is love that you had for him that has been forgotten? What country do you live in?  
Have you recovered any memory?  
What‚Äôs the scariest thing for you right now? Do you feel like you‚Äôve lost most of your life? Do you feel kinda like you‚Äôre a new person inhabiting a dead person‚Äôs body? Thrown into their life and forced to deal with the consequences of everything they‚Äôve done? I know I phrased that kinda terribly but I‚Äôve always had a fear of losing my memory and always thought this is how I‚Äôd feel like if I did.  
Are you still attracted to your boyfriend?  
Have you looked through the photos on your phone yet? If you did, what did you find that made you feel good, bad, confused, etc? Hope you recover quickly and feel better soon.  
Seeing that you are just learning about Covid-19 (Coronavirus), what's your reaction to it? A global pandemic was a shock to all of us when it happened slowly, cant imagine all at once. And do you have any affection for your family, friends, and boyfriend still? Thank you for answering and I so hope you get your memories back  
If theres a bright side to this I would say that it's that you get to experience all the things you lo 9ved for the first time all over again. You will learn to love the people around you for the first time again, and maybe listen to a song for the first time again. tha tf must be cool or maybe I'm wrong?  
Did you retain all your knowladge from school? I see you can speak English really well, which isn't your first language, so can you still do math? Do you know something about history and geography? If you played any instruments, will you be able to play, once you'll be free to move around? It's okay if you don't know this. I hope you get your memory back!  
Judging by your current knowledge, how bad do you think this year is? How much do you know about the current year and what‚Äôs going on? If you want, I can tell you a few of the crazy things that have happened this year.  
Did you freak out when you first saw your twin brother?  
So are you just calm about the prospect of not remembering anything? Will you remember doing this AMA?  
Just wanted to send hugs your way, this all sounds so traumatic. I hope you‚Äôre doing alright‚ù§Ô∏è  
[deleted]  
What did you remember, did you have to re-learn English or was it still in your memory? Do your parents feel like total strangers or are they more like a familiar memory that you just can‚Äôt put your finger on?  
Do you not remember anything , or did you just forget  people ? Like do you know what a pizza is ? And like what the name of our galaxy is and all that ? Do you even remember what a galaxy is ? Also , did you remember your own name ? ( Sorry for blasting you with questions im just curious )  
Did your family show you pictures and videos of the time before you lost your memory? If so, what is it like to see you in these without remembering?  
Have you had to re-learn basic things that most would consider common knowledge, like types of food or pop-culture references - or did you only lose memories pertaining to your specific life?  Sorry if that‚Äôs confusing; but for example, if someone handed you a plate of spaghetti for the first time since your surgery, would that be a brand new food?  My uncle suffered from a freak loss of memory incident and it was crazy all the every day things he marveled at... like trying peanut butter he was like ‚ÄúWHAT IS THIS STUFF ITS AMAZING!‚Äù He also had to re-learn how to read and stuff though, but I saw you already commented that you didn‚Äôt lose those ability‚Äôs.  
Were you surprised seeing a smartphone? (Or are you on a computer?) Did you remember how to use it? How did you feel going through photos of the years you forgot?  
If you lost your memory, how is it possible that you removed words, and other phrases? I have never understood how this has happened.  
Probably asked already but why was there a lack of oxygen during surgery? Shouldn‚Äôt you be suing your doctor?  
Why do you say ‚Äúfamily‚Äù? Were u adopted? Is that why it seems like they don‚Äôt know ur grandma?  
Did you know how to read spell ect. And do you know what a rick roll is if not search it thanks üòä  
[deleted]  
Just so you know. There are riots going on in america right now, theres a global pandemic going on, ww3 almost started this year, and the us government released tapes of actual UFOs this year. Not that they're aliens, just unidentified flying objects  
Are you ok?  That's a lot to take in all at once. I hope your doctors can recommend you to a therapist as well because this isn't something to take lightly. I hope for a speedy recovery for you.  
Have you talked to any of your friends? If yes, what was it like to talk to them? Were they like strangers? Hope you'll get better soon  
Did you legit know NOTHING at all, like... was it like you were a newborn, mentally?  
When you woke up, was your mentality the one of your 7YO self? And if so, do you feel your maturity coming back? Or not at all?  
Do you know what evolution is? Do you remember any education?  
[deleted]  
What if anything have you been doing to retrace your past and find the answers to your questions? All the best to you!  
[removed]  
We truly live in the dumbest timeline. Anyway, other than being confused for a mass shooter, how has your day been? Also, do you refer to the Federal Reserve as the Fed or the FED?  
How does it feel knowing you were misidentified? Does it bother you that complete strangers have been reading through your post history?  
You need to sue Mike ‚ÄúThe Rapist‚Äù Cernovich and the asshole that wrote the gateway pundit article. For mental anguish and harassment. Ask in /r/legaladvice for help first.  
Seems Reddit should keep it's day job and give up on the whole cyber detective thing. Enjoy your 15 minutes of Reddit fame, bro.   
What's really disturbing is a number of Trump-supporting commentators with a huge following just ran with it, reporting it as news on Twitter and elsewhere. I think a couple conservative websites even ran articles assuming that this guy was the shooter. Now who is "fake news?"  
Yeah there are news sites running it, hopefully stops soon but its already done enough to bolster some asswipes opinions  
[deleted]  
Its all fake news as far as im concerned. Reddit is a joke no matter which side of the aisle you choose to sit at.  This happens to be one of the more hilarious screw ups.   
[removed]  
 UPDATE: The anonymous Reddit user with the name ‚Äúravenchamps‚Äù wrote tonight on Reddit that he was not the shooter. We welcome him to contact us.    
There's (was) a the_donald thread that got removed where they were lambasting you for something along the lines of being a 'violent libtard Obama loving cuck'... this is hilarious.  
 UPDATE:¬†The anonymous Reddit user with the name ‚Äúravenchamps‚Äù wrote tonight on Reddit that he was not the shooter. We welcome him to contact us.  I need this to happen.  
‚ÄúUPDATE: An anonymous Reddit user was misidentified in an earlier post‚Äù Woooooow worst backpedal ever. Maybe put that at the too? Also not anonymous when they say his username in the post...  
So how do you feel about the NRA claiming Gaming Headphones to be the real reason people died? Do you agree they aided your killing spree by making it harder for people to notice your rampage? Or do you think the NRA is trying to discredit your streak? Article Reference here: https://www.rawstory.com/2018/08/nra-tv-host-warns-gamers-deadly-headphones-make-harder-hear-gunshots-fired/?utm_source=fark&utm_medium=website&utm_content=link&ICID=ref_fark  
I read your post history (sorry), and realized we are similar and browse a lot similar threads. Started to think I was a murderer. Thanks for saving me from weird thoughts lol  
Not sure if you know this but the one guy, Ian Miles Cheong, is covered in ants. He's always online, he's always posting, and it's always either weak-ass right wing propaganda or complaints about the ants crawling on his corpulent body. Doesn't that freak you out?  
Just wanna comment and say hi to the Gateway Pundit because they‚Äôre probably reading this.  Y‚Äôall are fucking stupid   
Sup not-Katz. When did you first hear the news?  (Or rather, when did you first realize people thought you were Katz?)  
Are you going to be bringing lawsuits against some of the websites that spread this defamatory information?  
Did you know that your posting history made it onto the Rush Limbaugh show today?  Sometime in the first hour he mentioned your Trumptards comment.  
Have you contacted the article that posted said it was you?  Ya gotta get the "oops we goofed" money from them.   
What ‚Äòproof‚Äô did they have that you were the shooter?  
--Username references Baltimore Ravens --History suggests he lives in Maryland --History suggests he plays Madden 19 frequently It could have been literally anyone from Maryland who plays Madden 19. Which is probably like 20 people who aren't the shooter, and 1 guy who was.   
Please please please light those GatewayPundit retards up. I'm sure you'll find a lawyer that will work on a contingency. Cut their fucking balls off.  
Aside from being targeted by the dumbest people on America right now, what other dumb shit has happened to you lately?    
Are you now, or have you ever been, a mass murderer?

IF THE GLOVE DOESN'T FIT  
How exactly did everyone, including multiple news outlets, come to the conclusion that you were the Madden shooter?  
 multiple news outlets  Most of the news outlets were shit. For instance including this episode Gateway pundit has misidentified the perpetrator of a terror attack 4 times in the last 20 months https://twitter.com/oneunderscore__/status/1034270115255279619  
Damn, the altreich's narrative would've gotten away with it too if not for that darn meddling u/ravenchamps  
People in cringeanarchy such as u/libtardslivfembenis spammed comment such as this:  ravenchamps SJW Response: "No it's fake he was a Trump supporter, r/politics and ShareBlue told me so." - /u/Kanarkly and throwaway_999912, unironically.  Hey, u/libtardsluvfembenis how does it feel knowing you‚Äôre an absolute moron? ü§£ü§£ü§£ Here‚Äôs the thread full of these geniuses: https://np.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/9aqca5/jacksonville_shooter_was_a_leftist_sjw_nutcase/  
what is your preferred skirt style ?  
This is the first time I've even heard of this rag called the Gateway Pundit. Do you think assholes like this purposefully do something as stupid as assume someone with an extremely generic username (no offense, the ravens are cool) is somehow connected to a shooting as a cynical ploy at self advertisement? And because they need a constant stream of misdirected rage to maintain viewership?   
What were your original plans for this evening before you found out you are a mass murderer?  
How many nasty PMs have you gotten and will you share each and every one of them  
Why did you do it  
how does it feel to become living proof that trumpian-americans are retarded?  
Doesn't your account being active already disqualify you as the shooter on account of the real shooter being dead?

WHAT THE FUCK  
Have you ever heard about "Death Grips"? It is a cool band, I promise! And also what is happening right now?!?!?!‚Ä¶!?!?!?!?????!!!??!?!???!?!!  
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO MAKE MIKE CERNOVICH AND IAN MILES CHEONG LOOK LIKE IDIOTS YOU MONSTER  
It‚Äôs disgusting that right wingers do this after every shooting.

15 seconds to go. 17 yards out. 2nd down. What's your go-to offensive formation?  
Do people not realize you are dead?   
Nice PC Bro. If the shooter had that PC I don't know why he would shoot anyone.  
Yes question, when fuckups and conspiracy assholes respond to this revelation by accusing you of being a "shill" and "deep state plant," attempting to dox you, issuing death anti-Semitic death threats, and violating TOS hundreds of times without any fear of disciplinary action rather than just admit that they are both wrong and stupid, how much hard drinking will you default to?  
What a shitshow. Good on you for not killing folks.  
Hey /u/Spez is it time to ban that shithole subreddit yet?  
There are still threads up from when they doxxed an innocent kid after a Trump supporter killed students in Florida. Him and his family couldn't even leave their house because of all the death threats they were getting.  https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7xlqmq/liberals_quick_to_call_nicolas_cruz_stoneman/ https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7xlq1y/nicolas_de_jesus_cruz_is_a_white_male/ They did the same after Charlottesville, Vegas and pretty much any major tragedy.   
So do you think this will become a meme, and your handle will be circulated after every mass shooting from now on?  
Why did ya do it? You had so much potential!!  
62K shares on that garbage page and who knows how many more permeating through the Facebook swamp. You should absolutely sue that dirtbag. This a community toxic enough to try to dox you. Since it's an AMA, how soon are you filing?  
Why do you think they presumed you were the killer?

The best part was watching trumpets and conspiracy theorists try to wrangle your posts up and create a narrative that would paint you as a violent shooter.

Have you even been to the basement of Comet Ping Pong Pizzeria?   
I‚Äôll admit that I was one of the guys that acted like an asshole and rushed to find some of your old posts to talk shit to make myself feel good. I‚Äôve deleted them but if they caused any distress I‚Äôm truly sorry.   
Man, I never get falsely accused of murder. What's your secret? Any tips?  
They updated the original article again and removed all mention of you this time. But nothing is ever truly deleted from the internet.  
Well now that you're dead, can I have your PC?  Or did you possessed it? If so, can I sell it to the next victim so there can be a Unfriended 3: Unfriendeder?  
What? Care to explain, I'm r/outoftheloop  
WHY DID YOU DO IT? This is undeniable proof that the shooter got away.  Right???  
WELL ARE YOU A TRUMP SUPPORTER OR NOT?!!/  
I agree with your username, the Ravens will be champs. Also this is your forever get out of jail free card if you need to be funny at a party. Just bring up that time that people thought you committed a mass shooting. People are gonna love it... just remember to tell them at the begging that you did nothing.   
Were your anti-Trump (and a few politically-neutral) comments deleted from when people still thought it was you?   
Parks and Rec or The Office?  
You‚Äôre such a fucking vape god, it‚Äôs unreal. Keep doing you, brother. Quick question though, how many vapes does it take to get to the center of the vape tank?

What site labeled you as the shooter first? I'm seeing it as TMZ being shitty again.   
This is the 2nd time in a year that Ravens fans were fucked over by the Bills via the proxy of an Orange     
Why do you think all of the Donald fan subs are locking their posts about you being the shooter? Could it be that they are thin-skinned and can‚Äôt take the ridicule?  
[deleted]  
Are you going to respond to the post made about you in r/subredditcancer? They still seem to think this account was the shooters.   
Wait what‚Äôs going on here? Why were you even accused? Where‚Äôd reddit even tie into this  
Wait im lost. You got framed for the whole thing??  
Did someone give you this account or has this always been your main account?

Man I'm glad this guy was the one those retards thought was the shooter, you're funny as fuck lmao  
So, did you just randomly sign on to this reddit account and discover you had been accused of this, or did you sign on because of the message /u/Splinterman11 sent? And if that is the case, when do you think you would have signed on to this account, you know? And if it is not the case, were you aware they sent you a message? HAHA

If I'm not too late and you haven't died, do you think the Ravens need to go 8-8 to save Harbaugh's job? Do you think Flacco needs to get to the playoffs to save his own?  
How did you get ‚Äúcaught‚Äù?  
Considering the fact that you are an awful person, why do you insist on ordering a Hawaiian pizza every time?  
Have you considered just replying to everyone threatening you with a link to goatse, tubgirl, etc?

Post history aligns with the shooter. Someone else, probably his mother, has his password, knows he was exposed and is now trying to save face for him. tl;dr: /u/ravenchamps was David Katz from the start, right now the /u/ravenchamps account is David Katz mother.

GUYS OP IS DEAD HE HASN'T POSTED ANYTHING FOR 6 MINUTES NOW  
[deleted]  
But you will tell us if you are dead, right?  
Why were you released so early, isn't 1st degree murder usually punished by life in prison? Also what happened to your relationship with your girlfriend and other people in your life? Other than killing the 73 year old is there any other effects that you regret?  
I‚Äôm not American. Different system where I am. I am still with my girlfriend now, most of my friends are guys I served with and we are still in contact. I regret the time I lost and I regret making such a mess. I believe the male I killed deserved it, I simply wish I‚Äôd killed him in a manner that hadn‚Äôt uprooted my life and lead to another man‚Äôs death. Not that his death was anyone‚Äôs fault but my own. I pulled the trigger, I have to own that.  
Personally I don't believe anyone deserves to die but if anyone did deserve it, it was that raping son of a bitch. What he did to your girlfriend was disgusting and horrible and I hope he is burning in hell but I still wish that he could have gotten his just desserts some other way and without the death of another man.  
How much time was there between the incident with the 31 year old man and his father? Were you just waiting around for someone else to show up, or did he show up there immediately after?  Also, What‚Äôs it like spending so much time in prison?  
I killed the 31 year old male within a minute, I sort of took it in before shooting his body. It was only a few seconds after I started shooting until the man turned up. All I saw was his gun so I killed him. Boring, very boring. Lonely at times too. World goes on and you‚Äôre stuck. I‚Äôm not saying I deserved better but the prison system is broken, 99% of the guys in there, petty crooks or serious criminals, come out worse than when they went in.  
Did you get out before or after Covid started? That would have been weird.  
What do you do now? Have you had trouble finding employment? What does your family/friends think? How old are you now?  
Bike mechanic. Yes and no, never going to be able to get a regular job but there are programmes in place that help people like me. Most of my friends served with me and don‚Äôt judge me for what happened. I don‚Äôt have any biological family. I‚Äôm in my 30s.  
 I beat him and he stopped moving. I knew he was dead after a few minutes but I wanted to make sure so I pulled out my gun and shot him twice in forehead and cheek, then I fired four more times into his stomach and neck.  You could have a promising career in a US police dept!  
So this guy from school was 31 12 years ago yet he was a guy from school? You must have knocked up a milf.  
Bicycle or motorcycle?  
[deleted]  
Thanks for the response. For what it's worth I'm rootin' for ya and I think most compassionate people would be understanding to the circumstances. You've done your time and it happened over a decade ago. I think most people would be able to recognize that.  
[removed]  
[deleted]  
Did you get any leniency based on the circumstances? Did you explain the nature of your motive in court?  
I was certainly treated better due to my service and certain actions I took during my service. Along with the fact my emotions were heightened due to what happened. However the latter isn‚Äôt a valid excuse. I knew exactly what I was doing and would gladly kill that male again. I wouldn‚Äôt say I enjoyed it but people like him need to be removed and I don‚Äôt regret removing him.  
[deleted]  
 Are you sorry for what you did? About those others murders... you said one was solved but what about the others? Why did they accuse you and did you do it?   
I regret killing the 73 year old man. He was trying to defend his child and he wasn‚Äôt responsible. I don‚Äôt regret killing the 31 year old male and I would do it all over again if I had a time machine. He deserved it.  
Sorry, just realised you never addressed my second question. Can you please?  
Sorry, forgot to address that. No, I didn‚Äôt kill them. I‚Äôm not a naturally violent person and would never randomly kill someone. What happened was a result of me wanting to get revenge and then getting caught up in the moment and firing without cause. I believe they linked me to the case because I was within the general area and they were also firearms related incidents. However I genuinely did not commit those crimes. I wouldn‚Äôt kill someone without reason, it‚Äôs illogical.  
Fair enough then. Last question I swear. You killed the first guy with your hands right? What exactly killed him?  
You're incredibly lucky... You had malicious intent (stalked the guy), broke into his house, beat the man to a pulp (your words in other comments), you were trained to kill (army training) then shot him repeatedly.. Then killed another man who was defending themselves from you. The fact that you even got out of jail is unreal to me. Have you met anyone in jail who's had a far worse sentence for something far less violent?  How do you cope with the guilt of shooting the old man? I'd imagine there has been lots of therapy involved. I'm just reading these comments, I'm honestly speechless. Like what if somebody sets you off, what's stopping you from killing again? You're obviously not a stranger to it.  
It's his sentence that makes me believe he isn't American.  Because in the States he would have probably been able to make a case for second degree murder for the son (even though it had some premeditation), but the father's murder would have been charged as the much harsher 1st degree murder (despite not being planned at all).  The reason for this is the father was killed during the commission of a felony (the felony being the second degree murder) which is known as "felony murder" and it is handled the same way as 1st degree.  
The fact that you don't regret it, is fucked to be honest. I know you'll never see it this way, but it's just not your call to make who deserves to live or die. It doesn't matter what they've done. You need help  
My dude you're telling a guy who spent 12 years inside for double murder that he needs help üòÇ you think that's news to him?  
So you killed two people and you served 12 years. Do you think six years served for each killing is proper justice? Oh, and you said you killed the 73 year old man because he was only trying to protect his kid. What were you going to do to his kid? Kill them too, rape them or simply beat the living hell out of them? You are a repeat disorganized murderer and you will kill again.  
I love watching movies based on revenge stories, but the movies never seem to capture what happens to the person afterwards. It makes me think about RDR2 and the theme of revenge being an empty persuit. Did you feel vindicated at all, or did it do more harm then good to you as a person?  
I read that as R2D2 and thought, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember that from Star Wars...‚Äù  
Films are films. They make things seem cool that really aren‚Äôt. I felt glad he was dead, he didn‚Äôt deserve to live. I didn‚Äôt feel much else regarding him. I did to him what I intended to do, I knew what I expect.  
How was prison?  
First one was easy, posh, naive guards and lots of wannabe kids posing as gangsters. Second one was a bit rougher but I fitted in easily enough. Only ever had one fight and the other guy came out very badly. I had no other issues with people. Loneliness sucked though.  
Is it possible to make friends in prison?  
Not a question but an observation.  You come across as someone very in control of themselves and your answers are polite and dignified almost. And it sounds like life is good and I hope and pray it continues to improve and your gf gets better. Actually, I do have a question. Why are you doing an AMA? I'm finding it incredibly informative, so thank you. But what are your motivations?  
Thank you. Yes, I‚Äôd say I am. I don‚Äôt really get set off anymore and all these responses, good or bad, are justified.  Honestly, I‚Äôm not sure. I guess I just thought it would be interesting for both me and people on here to do one where I answer honestly. It‚Äôs not a common perspective.  Motivations for the AMA?  
Yeah, it's really interesting.  It seems a little risky with the details you've provided, don't you think? I hope you get to keep your anonymity anyway and you can lead the life you want with your girlfriend. Take care buddy and thanks for answering the question.  
Where does your calmness come from ? You said you read a lot of books, did philosophy ones help ? Do you plan on seeing a therapist for life in general? also did you see a therapist in prison and did it help?  
Do you ever struggle with the idea that you may be a bad person for what you did? How do you feel about yourself after everything?  
I know I am a bad person. In my life I‚Äôve killed 9 people. (7 were in combat and legal) I felt bad for two. I know what I am and I live with it, I don‚Äôt really feel much in the way of emotion anymore. I am what I am, these days I just want to live with what I have and not be bothered by anything dramatic ever again.  
Obviously you feel bad about the old guy, but you mentioned that you felt bad for two out of nine deaths. Who was the second?  
I killed a child. He was rigging an IED right near us, I yelled at him and told him to fuck off, we gave him a chance cause he was a kid. He stared at us and then started rummaging about in his pockets so I shot him. We searched him after and he had a glock and a dead cat‚Äôs head on him. He was a weird kid but still a kid, I wish I didn‚Äôt have to do that. I don‚Äôt blame him. I blame the animals who taught him what he did was the right thing to do.  
Honestly mate you saved at least one person from getting shot don't feel as bad. Yes I know it was a kid but being brutally honest he'd would be dead on the next few years anyway.  
Your taking responsibility. Not to make light of your situation, but that's kinda funny because of your username. Jokes aside, it's not easy to admit to yourself that you did what you did. Can you tell yourself, honestly, that you regret what you did? If you can, then you've grown as a person. I hope you find a future out there. Good luck buddy. Make amends.  
Are you certain the cat was dead?  
A little off topic, but I imagine killing a child was very traumatizing. Do you believe the US' presence in the Middle East is justified?  
9? 7 were legal? How so  
[deleted]  
Yes, had a few rocky moments while I was in prison but neither of us ever cheated or ended things, hopefully we‚Äôll get married once things clear up.  
[removed]  
Nah, man, in my opinion both killings were justified. The first, because, well, the case. The second one could still, surmising only from the points presented, as a case of self-defense. The justice system is weird.  
Agree with you there. If the court system handled it, 31guy would get 3 hots and a cot for a few years then get released to go ruin someone else's life. In a different comment, op mentioned how someone reported their attacker and got killed later, I don't think op wanted that possibility. Not saying murder is okay for every crime but I can't really blame op for popping 31guy. Not so much about 73guy though.  
My brother in law was shot outside a bar. The shooter had a beef with some people inside (no one knew my BIL). Bro was outside having a smoke and the shooter thought it would be smart to shoot in to the crowd. BIL died outside before the ambulance got there. This was barely 4 years ago. Shooter got 10 years and just got turned down for day parole. I‚Äôm in Canada and our justice system is a joke. I‚Äôm not sure when it stopped being about justice and more about the rights of the guilty. I think if I was in this situation I‚Äôd do the same. Someone has to protect the most vulnerable.  
 please, ignore those who say you need help for not regretting killing the rapist. He did deserve it  This reminds me of the time on a talk show. I forget who. Back in the day of Sally Jesse and Jenny and all that. A guy was in prison for beating his brother to death for raping his kid. I was like why???? He deserved to be killed.  
First and foremost I am sorry what happen to your partner and the pregnancy. No words for that. Please don‚Äôt feel you have to answer these questions. But I will pose them anyway as I am curious.  What are you able to discuss in regard to the rape and beating? Why were your partner and this person in the same place? What triggered the violent attack? Do you ever worry that something may have been going on between them? You will never get the other side of the story. Also, could you partner be scared of what you may do to her, if the truth, if any, was revealed? Just my curiosity. With little details provided these questions arose in my head. Again, not saying your partner, who was the victim of a horrendous attack had any part in what took place.  
Thank you. They were at a mutual friends house. He was drunk and my girlfriend is an attractive woman, he decided he wanted her and took that because he was an animal. No, if my girlfriend wanted to cheated or leave me she had countless chances. I once basically yelled at her to leave me, begging almost, she didn‚Äôt. I did get the other side of the story. There was a witness but she never came forward because my girlfriend asked her not to. I know she didn‚Äôt cheat. It‚Äôs simply not in her nature. And no, I would never hurt her. I‚Äôve never once put hands on her and never would. Interesting questions though, thanks.  
What was the legal process after your "red handed" arrest?  Did you plead guilty, did a lawyer negotiate a deal, or did you put together a defence and try to get off (or any other options in your country)?  
I didn‚Äôt say anything to the police ever, I only spoke briefly during sentencing and pleaded guilty. I did it and lying and saying I didn‚Äôt would just look stupid. I had the motive, means and I literally had blood on my hands. I knew I wasn‚Äôt getting off.  
How are you adjusting to regular life? For all it's worth, thank you for your service. That's a crazy situation.  
I think lockdowns helped. I went from cells to having to stay at home. Adjusting to friendly chat with strangers is still difficult. Appreciate it but don‚Äôt thank me, I didn‚Äôt do it for my country I did it because it seemed fun and paid well, most military guys join for the benefits. We shouldn‚Äôt have been in that sandpit.  
You don‚Äôt have to answer these questions, but I'm genuinely curious and without judgement: I read in your comments that you deliberately decided "this person needs to be erased". While not many people go through what you did (hopefully!), I assume not all of them resort to killing. Even when they don‚Äôt trust law enforcement. What made you feel so strongly that he had to die and you were going to make sure he did? Do you think serving made it "easier" to decide someone's fate/right to live? Did you ever think about the possibility of some easing circumstances in his life? (I‚Äôm not at all agreeing with what he did! I‚Äôm a sexual assault survivor myself. I‚Äôm genuinely curious how you feel, since I tend to be too empathetic and forgiving sometimes) Thank you!  
He hurt my girlfriend. In my mind if you do that I will kill you. It may not be a legal justification but it‚Äôs what I go by. I was angry and I didn‚Äôt want him to live after what he did. I think knowing what killing was like may have made it easier but I‚Äôve had done it regardless. It needed to be done.  No, I didn‚Äôt and I still don‚Äôt care. You can be an angel who feeds every kid in Africa but if you rape my girlfriend I‚Äôm going to kill you, I don‚Äôt care what was going on in his existence. I‚Äôm sorry for what happened to you, I hope you‚Äôre doing better now.  
What did your girlfriend think of what you did?  
There was so much change over those months neither of us really processed it properly. We are still together now but it‚Äôs something we don‚Äôt discuss too deeply. Too much pain, for her especially.  
Do you ever worry that she may be afraid of you? How would you feel if she ever wanted to leave you, or if she cheated on you or something like that?  
No. I know she‚Äôs not afraid of me, I never would and never have hurt her and she knows that. Early on I told her to leave me because she didn‚Äôt deserve this but she refused every time I tried to bring it up, eventually she would go on a sort of silence strike where she wouldn‚Äôt say a word until I agreed to stop saying it. We both hate cheating and even if our relationship fell apart, I don‚Äôt see us doing that. We‚Äôd just cut out losses.  
When you came out of prison and back into the "real world" did some new thing sursprise you?  
Phones were better, motorbikes were easier to ride, people were basically the same. No real surprises though, we got TV in there and I spoke to my girlfriend for a few hours every day.  
That makes sense, you seem like a good guy I honestly wishe you were able to kill that 31 year old bastard who murdered your child in a way that would have left the old guy alive. But no use to cry over spilled milked, I wish you and your girlfriend years of happines. And thanks for the quick response.  
As do I. I could have as well which is the sad part, I should have shot him and left, or just walked away when I knew he was dead. Instead I didn‚Äôt and another guy lost his life. Maybe one day I‚Äôll get a way to make up for it, if it‚Äôs possible.  
Was your username your defence in court?  
Yes, it was a brilliant strategy and they almost believed me. Right until I stopped imagining it and said it out loud.  
Did you say anything to the rapist before you attacked him?  
all these replies are kind of sick, this isn‚Äôt a joke. three people were murdered and you all respond with this. i‚Äôm kind of disgusted  
I read in another one of your responses that your girlfriend was sorry the old man died- but was she happy that her rapist was killed?  What does her family think of what you did? When the 31 year old shat himself, did you smell it or see it first?  How far along was she when she lost the baby? By the way, no need to answer any of these questions if they make you feel uncomfortable. Thanks for taking the time to write this.  
Her dad is glad I did it, her mother was horrified but felt sorry for me and let it go.  Heard it, didn‚Äôt smell or see it. I did see his muscles relax though and heard gas release so it was obvious. 5 months 3 weeks and 3 days.  
I‚Äôm so sorry for your/you girlfriend‚Äôs loss, and the many years you lost. Is this the first time you‚Äôve used Reddit? Are you worried that what you write here could be used against you? (In the US we have double jeopardy laws protecting people from being tried twice for the same thing, but I‚Äôm not sure how it is there) What do you think of shooters and victory Royale games like Call of Duty, Fortnite, etc? Are they silly to you since you‚Äôve actually killed people, or are they still fun? Do you think the murder and ensuing sentence ruined your life? Do you consider yourself a happy person? Are you able to enjoy things?  Was there financial difficulty for your girlfriend? Was she able to get therapy or other help? Does she have lasting health problems from what happened?  
Yes. Though I‚Äôve browsed it before. I can‚Äôt be charged for admitting to anything they already got me for, I‚Äôm more concerned about my identity being leaked to the public again.  Call of duty is fun, it‚Äôs harmless. Very unrealistic though, you can‚Äôt run around like that and you can‚Äôt walk off bullets, I‚Äôve been hit before and my vest caught it but I was still a stumbling mess and broke two ribs, you couldn‚Äôt walk off a grenade like you can in that. I don‚Äôt know what fortnite is sorry.  I think it is what it is, it‚Äôs in the past. I lost almost 14 years. I‚Äôm not going to lose the rest of my life by dwelling on what will be a very small period of my life. No, she was okay financially thankfully. I‚Äôm not going to talk about her health as it‚Äôs her business but you can imagine what it would do to a person. She‚Äôs going to therapy soon, it‚Äôs been a long time coming and I hope it helps her.  
I remember this when it happened, and know who you are. Just gotta say, didn't blame you then, dont blame you now. What are your plans moving forward though?  
[deleted]  
I‚Äôd appreciate if you keep that to yourself then, I know it‚Äôs public but I kind of don‚Äôt want this linked to me. Plans are just to keep my head down and work. I don‚Äôt want any more drama.  
Military trained double murderer says ‚ÄúI‚Äôd appreciate if you keep that to yourself...‚Äù I think you should listen to him üòÇ  
That sounded a lot more sinister than intended. I just meant I‚Äôd kill him. Just for clarification. That was a joke.  
If it makes you feel any better, I've killed folks too while serving as well. And nobody in their right minds judges you first what happened. However, I wont disclose anything to anyone. Jot my story to tell. However, I'll heed your very clear warning, lol  
What are your thoughts on how you handled/what you did to the male that hurt your girlfriend?  Would you of  done things differently? How does your girlfriend feel about it?  
It was unnecessarily messy. I didn‚Äôt need to kill his father and I shouldn‚Äôt have stormed into his house guns blazing. In hindsight I would have killed him in a manner that would have resulted in me not being caught. Would have saved everyone a lot of stress. I‚Äôd have killed him regardless though, he didn‚Äôt deserve to live. She, like me, hates that an innocent old man died and she obviously didn‚Äôt like that I was gone for years but we are in a good place now.  
First of all thankyou for replying.  I read in one of your comments that you was deployed when the brutal attack on your girlfriend happened.   I'm wondering if you being away and not be able to respond instantly to it played a massive part in the severity of your response?  
Seems you feel quite a lot of guilt over the father. I've seen it in a lot of your comments. However, considering the son lived with the father, if you'd been more careful about him, it may have worked against you in a "passion killing" case (more calculated, more pre-meditated), assuming you got caught.  Likewise, if the father figured out it was you, he may have come after you or sent people for you, or your girlfriend. Or tried to keep you in prison.  How would you have done it differently?  
How much do you enjoy this AMA? Is it strange to relive it with strangers or does it help you move forward?  
It‚Äôs interesting to discuss this with the general public. I wouldn‚Äôt say I enjoy it but it‚Äôs interesting. I moved on a while ago, I just thought it would make for an interesting QnA and I‚Äôve always wanted to do one and get some perspectives, I just didn‚Äôt want to become famous for what I did or deal with the media so I never did it officially before.  
The world has obviously changed a lot during the past 12 years. What was the biggest difference from when you went to prison? What surprised you the most?  
Are you ok? Is your wife better?  
I‚Äôm actually okay. She‚Äôs still affected and can be a little clingy, to the point of always needing to be around me, I understand it given everything, she‚Äôs going to start therapy soon as I don‚Äôt want her to try and build her identify entirely off me. It was a tough conversation to have but I think it‚Äôs healthy, she needs to be her own person outside of us.  
It must be a complicated situation. I wish you and your wife some better days and I hope the will pay. She'll still need your protection. Be here for her even tho she indeed needs to be able to be alone without getting terrified. This is a very sad story.  
I‚Äôm always going to be there for her. I‚Äôm just trying to help her become her own person again too, I‚Äôm not an expert so she‚Äôs going to therapy. Even if she still stays dependent it will be good for her to get some help. She needs it.  
What other actions could you or would you have taken versus breaking into his house and killing him?  
Probably would have killed him with carbon monoxide or dissolved his body and buried his teeth etc under the grave of a dog or something. That way when sniffer dogs roll around they‚Äôll dig up the dogs grave and the police will move on thinking that‚Äôs all there was to find. You‚Äôd be surprised how easy it is to get away with murder if you just use your brain. I didn‚Äôt.  
Is it strange that I totally support you killing this guy for what he did, but would be appalled if you had also had killed an innocent dog to bury on top, in order to get away with it?  
I‚Äôm a strong believer in law above all, but in that case, I‚Äôd say the law failed your girlfriend and subsequently, you as well.  Now the question, How has this incident affected your relationship with your girlfriend? Would you say it strengthened it or was more of a hurdle in your relationship?  
[deleted]  
She didn‚Äôt talk to the police because the police are useless with this sort of thing. The last person in our area who told the police who raped her was then beaten to death by her rapist.  
Interesting, was that part of either of yours defence in court?  
Both. It was difficult but after getting through all of this I don‚Äôt see anything ending our relationship. Other than being unfaithful, but again, if we got through this without cheating I don‚Äôt see it happening now.  
Do you think you'd have done this if you weren't in the armed forces, and as such did the state effectively turn you in to a killer?  
Interesting question. I don‚Äôt think it would have changed what I did. It just made it easier. While I was serving I took the lives of 7 people, after the first few I learned to put it aside, I did the same here and it made it easier to deal with emotionally. I also believe my training may have made handling both men easier but with guns, especially up close, it‚Äôs not a huge factor.  
Do you think you let that guy that raped your GF off easy? I mean, he's dead - he didn't suffer or have the chance to feel sorry for what he did. I mean honestly if faced with life in prison or death, I'd choose death every time - it's the easy way out. Also, when are you going to marry her? I mean she stuck around for a long time and have proven herself to you. That right there, is wife material!  
I'm sorry if I come of as a bit rude in this it is not my intention at all. If you dont mind me asking, why could you not just call the police? I think for me I just wouldnt be able to deal with the guilt of killing a person whatever they did. Dont get me wrong that guy is disgusting but what would have happened if you took him to court? Would he get life in prison? Ig my question to u is why were you not satisfied by that and instead had to kill him? My other question is how do u know for sure that he did this? Isnt that the whole point of the system we have? To give everyone a fair and equal chance and a sentence that we as a society have determined to be appropriate not just one person(in this case urself).  
Do you think that rapists should be treated as troubled individuals and rehabilitated?  
What do you think are some of the biggest problems in the world?  
Acceptance. People sit by and allow shit to happen because it doesn‚Äôt affect them, after a while that piles up and before long everyone is fucked. Think of any shitty situation in the world right now, you can apply that train of thought to all of it.  
I know you can‚Äôt give too much away for sake of privacy, but could you comment on how the justice system treats people differently purely based off identity? (Race, sex, etc.) I‚Äôm interested to see here how it seems from a different, more up close and personal view  
If you‚Äôre not white you‚Äôre more likely to get the book thrown at you but once you‚Äôre in the system they‚Äôll try and keep you no matter who you are. Prison is quite literally, a waste of time. There‚Äôs no rehabilitation going on. If you lock up a dumb kid for drunk driving and put him in a block with 50 drug dealers it‚Äôs not exactly a shock when he comes out an addict.  
If you had a child/children would you still have done what you did?  Knowing that you would be away from your family for a large amount of years?  
How do you deal with the reality of your actions on a daily basis?  
[deleted]  
Do you cook with plastic or wooden spoons?  
Now that you've been to prison, do you think there's a better way to deal with criminals?  You've mentioned that you thought prison was a waste of time and there's no rehabilitation offered, so I'd be interested to hear what you think would be better.  
If somebody killed your innocent girlfriend in a fit of rage, would 12 years incarceration be a suitable punishment?  
How did prison change your perception of the world? Thanks for the AMA.  
How many people have you killed in your life?  
right now, what are you most looking forward to in the future? thank you for sharing, i know this kind of vulnerability can be very taxing.  
Did you get respect in prison for killing a guy who raped and abused a pregnant woman? I hear that in prison you usually get more respect if your crime didn't involve hurting women or children, so I'm betting that dude was way up on the worst-among-the-worst list.  I'm sorry for the loss of your child and what happened to your gf, honestly that guy deserved it. Its unfortunate about the father, but you wouldn't have killed him under normal circumstances, regretting it through years in prison was probably punishment enough. That must have been hard to live with.  
Is it true that many of the men in the prisons are homosexuals?  
No. I only ever saw one case of prison rape and once we all found out we handled the rapist. Prison is a very homophobic environment, I‚Äôm sure there were gay people with us but they didn‚Äôt advertise it. If anything went on it was done quietly.  
When you were accused of killing the 3 other people, we're you under the impression that the Prosecutor was just throwing the book at you, as it were, or do you think they genuinely believed that you killed those other people?  And for what its worth I understand why you did what you did, and I hope you can live the best life you can.  
The amount of people praising you and only mentioning the dad with a "oh well, couldn't be helped" "whoopsie too bad" saddens and shocks me so much. That was a sleeping old man in his bed that got woken up by loud noises and then gunshots. He ran downstairs to defend his family and was instantly killed. Nothing in this was justice.  
for real it‚Äôs disgusting. imagine your dad or mom coming out and seeing you getting mowed down on the floor with a hail of bullets and getting murdered in cold blood for trying to stop this guy. Then the guy only serving 12 years with little regret or trauma and saying if he could do it again he would melt the corpse in acid instead. Whatever country this guy is from that would let him go after such a short time for killing a completely innocent man, I need to never ever fucking visit  
Did the corona virus have any impact on your early release from prison? You're, understandably so, very careful about protecting your identity. Have you suffered any backlashes before from not doing so? This is one of the most interesting AMA's I've read. Thank you for doing it.  
Did you ever had dream about the father and his son?  
What happend to your then girlfriend? Did she move on? or are you two together.  
Has your sex life gotten back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and what was it like when you had sex after your release?  
What the fuck are these replies, you murdered people. You fucked up. You talk about it like it‚Äôs a movie and you‚Äôre a main character but you fucked up and you have issues. Have you seen a therapist? This isn‚Äôt good for your mental health just saying.  
Heavy narcissist vibes. He came here for validation, and the whole thing reeks of some kind of sick Punisher cosplay. And of course reddit is prostrating itself before their alpha male vigilante hero. What a strange revealing shit show this has become.  
You said you aren't in the US. Would you be willing to say what country? And I always associate owning a gun to be almost exclusively American. How did you acquire it? What type was it?  
Have you been diagnosed by a physiatrist for anything?  
Wow very interesting AMA. Sorry for you and your partner. Hope you have a good life with her. Are you still planning on kids later?  
Was your girlfriend close to her father? How did she react at first? Was she angry, upset, a mixture etc. Also what country do you live in and how does the community you're surrounded by treat you? And are you living with your girlfriend currently? Did you deal with covid restrictions in prison? How did it feel to emerge into society only to be greeted by a pandemic? Did you learn of the virus in prison? Sorry for so many questions!!!  
She is. She was upset because she knew I‚Äôd be gone for a long time. I‚Äôm not going to answer anything to do with locations, sorry. The community were generally sympathetic. Both guys I killed weren‚Äôt very well liked and I was sort of seen as a ‚Äúwar hero‚Äù as I was the only local guy to see action so those who still know me treat me with respect. Yes, we‚Äôre still together. No. Lockdown started shortly after I was released. It was good honestly, lockdown in a house with someone I love is nicer than 12 years lockdown in a cell. Learned about it over the phone but I didn‚Äôt really care honestly. It was very minor when I learned about it and I wasn‚Äôt focused on it. Now I of course wear a mask because I‚Äôm not a cunt.  
Would you do it again?  
Are you still together with the girl?  
You were right to kill the 31. Wish I could do something like that for someone, but I'm a coward.  
You‚Äôre not a coward for being unwilling to murder someone. Restraint is hard, it‚Äôs also a rare quality. Call it cowardice if you want but it‚Äôs not a bad thing.  
Im trying to understand the dynamics here, your girlfriends friend beat and raped her? Was it an affair that turned sour and got violent? Or did he stalk and then attack and rape her?  
I read the majority of this AMA and there aren‚Äôt enough motorbike questions.  Prior to prison, how much mechanic experience did you have? What did you think/feel when you got on a modern bike? Feel free to share anything else you want about motorbikes.  I have a 2015 S1000RR, hope you get yours soon mate.  
Did you read any good books while in prison?  
What is the worst thing u saw in prison?  
Sorry if it sounds cliche but do you imagine any kind of situation where you would be violent towards your girlfriend (except the case where she would attack you first)? Is there any reason she should be afraid of you like if she quitted you or something ? If you were experiencing ptsd or something similar would you be able to seek therapy in your country?  
How were the dementors?  
All these people in here sympathizing with a murderer. I think there‚Äôs a bunch of serial killers on Reddit just waiting to go off.  
can you please reply to this so I can tell people I have  talked to a murderer  
If death penalty was a thing in your country, would you have thought twice before killing the rapiste?  
So your girl gets all beat up and raped... surely the beat up would of left enough evidence that she could‚Äôve went to the police. Either this is a made up story or you murdered two people based on a lie your girlfriend told you...  
Table of Questions and Answers. Original answer linked - Please upvote the original questions and answers.    Question Answer Link    1. Are you sorry for what you did?  2. About those others murders... you said one was solved but what about the others? Why did they accuse you and did you do it? I regret killing the 73 year old man. He was trying to defend his child and he wasn‚Äôt responsible. I don‚Äôt regret killing the 31 year old male and I would do it all over again if I had a time machine. He deserved it. Here   What did your girlfriend think of what you did? There was so much change over those months neither of us really processed it properly. We are still together now but it‚Äôs something we don‚Äôt discuss too deeply. Too much pain, for her especially. Here   What do you do now? Have you had trouble finding employment? What does your family/friends think? How old are you now? Bike mechanic. Yes and no, never going to be able to get a regular job but there are programmes in place that help people like me. Most of my friends served with me and don‚Äôt judge me for what happened. I don‚Äôt have any biological family. I‚Äôm in my 30s. Here   How are you adjusting to regular life? For all it's worth, thank you for your service. That's a crazy situation. I think lockdowns helped. I went from cells to having to stay at home. Adjusting to friendly chat with strangers is still difficult. Appreciate it but don‚Äôt thank me, I didn‚Äôt do it for my country I did it because it seemed fun and paid well, most military guys join for the benefits. We shouldn‚Äôt have been in that sandpit. Here   That's too bad about the old guy. What became of you and your girlfriend? Are you still together? Yes, had a few rocky moments while I was in prison but neither of us ever cheated or ended things, hopefully we‚Äôll get married once things clear up. Here   How was prison? First one was easy, posh, naive guards and lots of wannabe kids posing as gangsters. Second one was a bit rougher but I fitted in easily enough. Only ever had one fight and the other guy came out very badly. I had no other issues with people. Loneliness sucked though. Here   Was your username your defence in court? Yes, it was a brilliant strategy and they almost believed me. Right until I stopped imagining it and said it out loud. Here   How did prison change your perception of the world? Thanks for the AMA. It didn‚Äôt really. The world is what you make it, most just choose to make it a shitty place. Prison just reinforced that belief. Here   How much time was there between the incident with the 31 year old man and his father? Were you just waiting around for someone else to show up, or did he show up there immediately after?  Also, What‚Äôs it like spending so much time in prison? I killed the 31 year old male within a minute, I sort of took it in before shooting his body. It was only a few seconds after I started shooting until the man turned up. All I saw was his gun so I killed him.  Boring, very boring. Lonely at times too. World goes on and you‚Äôre stuck. I‚Äôm not saying I deserved better but the prison system is broken, 99% of the guys in there, petty crooks or serious criminals, come out worse than when they went in. Here   Why were you released so early, isn't 1st degree murder usually punished by life in prison? Also what happened to your relationship with your girlfriend and other people in your life? Other than killing the 73 year old is there any other effects that you regret? I‚Äôm not American. Different system where I am. I am still with my girlfriend now, most of my friends are guys I served with and we are still in contact. I regret the time I lost and I regret making such a mess. I believe the male I killed deserved it, I simply wish I‚Äôd killed him in a manner that hadn‚Äôt uprooted my life and lead to another man‚Äôs death. Not that his death was anyone‚Äôs fault but my own. I pulled the trigger, I have to own that. Here   I‚Äôm a strong believer in law above all, but in that case, I‚Äôd say the law failed your girlfriend and subsequently, you as well.  Now the question, How has this incident affected your relationship with your girlfriend? Would you say it strengthened it or was more of a hurdle in your relationship? Both. It was difficult but after getting through all of this I don‚Äôt see anything ending our relationship. Other than being unfaithful, but again, if we got through this without cheating I don‚Äôt see it happening now. Here   Is it true that many of the men in the prisons are homosexuals?

Prison is quite literally, a waste of time. There‚Äôs no rehabilitation going on. If you lock up a dumb kid for drunk driving and put him in a block with 50 drug dealers it‚Äôs not exactly a shock when he comes out an addict. Here   Do you ever struggle with the idea that you may be a bad person for what you did? How do you feel about yourself after everything? I know I am a bad person. In my life I‚Äôve killed 9 people. (7 were in combat and legal) I felt bad for two. I know what I am and I live with it, I don‚Äôt really feel much in the way of emotion anymore. I am what I am, these days I just want to live with what I have and not be bothered by anything dramatic ever again. Here   How do you deal with the reality of your actions on a daily basis? Honestly, I don‚Äôt really dwell on it. It‚Äôs been over a decade. It sounds harsh but eventually you run out of guilt and shift to a kind of passive regret. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have killed that old man, he was innocent. Here   Did you get any leniency based on the circumstances? Did you explain the nature of your motive in court? I was certainly treated better due to my service and certain actions I took during my service. Along with the fact my emotions were heightened due to what happened. However the latter isn‚Äôt a valid excuse. I knew exactly what I was doing and would gladly kill that male again. I wouldn‚Äôt say I enjoyed it but people like him need to be removed and I don‚Äôt regret removing him. Here   Do you think you'd have done this if you weren't in the armed forces, and as such did the state effectively turn you in to a killer? Interesting question. I don‚Äôt think it would have changed what I did. It just made it easier. While I was serving I took the lives of 7 people, after the first few I learned to put it aside, I did the same here and it made it easier to deal with emotionally.

In hindsight I would have killed him in a manner that would have resulted in me not being caught. Would have saved everyone a lot of stress. I‚Äôd have killed him regardless though, he didn‚Äôt deserve to live. She, like me, hates that an innocent old man died and she obviously didn‚Äôt like that I was gone for years but we are in a good place now. Here    Source  
Honestly question, how did you not get the death penalty? You 100% deserve it, but you got to walk away while an innocent person is dead. It‚Äôs even more disgusting that Reddit is perfectly fine with this and treating you like some kind of hero. You‚Äôre a monster that deserves nothing short of death. You‚Äôre a piece of shit and I hope karma catches up to you.  
At the risk of standing corrected, I call bullshit on this story. First he says he arrived at his house at 7:57 PM and broke through a window, after which he killed him in minutes. In another comment you can trace in his post history, he says he entered the house at 2AM in Kevlar, so which is it? Did he wait in his backyard, or what? In another comment he says he won't mention the means to owning his guns, but later claims they weren't his.  
Did you say anything to the rapist befote rustling his raisins?  
[removed]  
I have never understood people's obsession with sex, esp rape. A mere 2 mins of pleasure, be it rape or sex. That being said, will all due respect,   Do you think killing someone would teach them a lesson or make them realize what they have done? We are all energy particles in human form come here to learn ( at least I believe so). Until we self realize things, learning doesn't happen quick.  Do you think had the person been alive today but in a bad physical/emotional condition (say you broke his arms/legs forever) would give him time to realize what he has done and ask for forgiveness from you girlfriend? I truly believe that when we forgive our predators we heal way way faster. But in this case, you and her are might weigh the killing forever. What I am trying to say is, would you seek others to do the say what you did? Do you think if firearms were illegal, you would have made different choice (I know knives are there) Have you thought about meditation? It helps a lot with bringing all the garbage to the surface.   All this being said, I dont mean to offend you in anyway and I cannot even fathom what you and your girlfriend must have been through. I am truly sorry.  I wish you both the best.  
How do you actually know that guy raped your GF? Many times people have faked being raped, did you ever think maybe she was cheating on your and instead of admitting it, she pretended she got raped so that you would go kill him?  She could have not wanted to tell the police because false rape charges will get you put in prison. You never gave the law a chance and murdered an innocent old man. You're a piece of shit too. Edit: OP has also killed children, major piece of shit.  
Thanks for doing this.  Since you said the worlds what you make it,  I‚Äôm curious about your view of the world. What gives you purpose in it?  Is it different now compared to before 2007?  
Did you get raped in jail?  
The fact that this got so much praise is beyond me...  
What does AMA stand for  
Why doesn‚Äôt your title say ‚ÄúI killed to people and was successfully...? The way you worded it made it sound like you didn‚Äôt do it.  
Why do you feel like you deserved to just spend time in prison for your crime and the other person deserved to just die, what makes you special that you thought you shouldn‚Äôt die for commuting the crime you committed?  
Does people got rape stereotypes true? (not you ofcourse but do you know somebody that did)  
Have you paid any retribution to the family of the 73 year old?  
He doesn‚Äôt care as long as his girlfriend isn‚Äôt hurt  
Haha redditors over here praising a killer because he said it was vengeance but the story doesn't add up plus it's completely one sided. Hey reddit there's a reason this guy was convicted there's obviously much more to the story that you aren't being told. I swear redditors minds are like clay.  
When were you released and if you could do it over, what would you do differently?  
Why was ur girlfriend with this guy in the first place? U think the rape was completely unprovoked? There‚Äôs a reason she didn‚Äôt report it to the police, she was probably cheating on u with him  
I'm proud of you. It's dark, but I think about how I would act in this situation. I have a little sister who is my world. I hope I would have the courage you did if that happened to her. I would proudly spend the rest of my life in prison just to tell her the man who hurt her is gone, and he'll never hurt anyone again. I wish you all the best.  
So your violent felon who took the law in your own hand  
You killed two people because your girlfriend said she was raped? How did you know she was telling the truth?  
Did you have words with the rapist before killing him? Did he know she was your girlfriend? This whole thing sounds like it could be made into a motion picture.  
Does it bother you to see so much of America side with criminals now?  
The tone of this q and a is very light hearted and misguided IMO. You are a murderer and should have spent far more time in prison. My question is: do you think you got off easy?  
Thank you. I‚Äôm literally scared at how many people in this thread are shrugging the killing of the old man off as an ‚Äúoopsies‚Äù.  
[deleted]  
He definitely got off easy (if true). Breaking and entering someone‚Äôs home and killing an innocent man deserves so much more than just the years he spent in prison. He clearly thinks that rape deserves death (without trial), so what do you think the murder of an innocent person deserves?  
damn dude that's rough. how are you holding up?  
I‚Äôve spent way too much time thinking about this post but I‚Äôve come to a standstill. So you said your gf was a a mutual friends house with the man when this happened. How did he manage to do this and no one notice or do anything? Wouldn‚Äôt they see her bloodied? They obviously know who the guy is so why wouldn‚Äôt they report him? I‚Äôm confused how this guy walks away from that scenario initially.  
Wouldn‚Äôt it had been more fair if the father killed you? I mean that‚Äôs even. He killed your child and you killed his son, so he gets to kill you. No harm no foul.  
If you hadn't of joined the military do you think you could have still killed him. If you could, do you think you would have mentally handled it?  
[deleted]  
The murderer says he's now in his mid 30s yet he killed a 31 year old twelve years ago. So that would have put the murderer in his late teens or early 20s. And yet the 31 year old rapist was a "friend" of the murderer's girlfriend from the same school. Does that seem odd to anyone else?

What is it about wanting to kill someone for revenge? No disrespect. Just never understood it. You‚Äôre essentially putting that sick person out of their misery, I‚Äôd want them to suffer a horrible life. I feel like death is getting off easy, as dark as that sounds.  
I would certainly have left you in prison.  
My mother was brutally raped when I was 14.   My stepfather was angry enough to kill the man.  He tried to find him.   If he had killed him it would have saved a lot of lives.  The man that raped my mother became a serial killer and currently sits on Florida's death row.  Your actions could have certainly saved many lives. I consider myself a huge bleeding heart liberal.  I don't believe in the death penalty.  That being said I understand your actions.  I have incredible respect that you owned up to your actions and continue to acknowledge your own faults.  You did say in one of the comments that you are a "bad" guy.  You are clearly not a sociopath.  You are someone who did a bad thing.  All of us have that potential.  I may have missed it but did you describe your actions immediately following killing the two men?  Did you call the police?  Did you hide?  How did they track you down?  
you seem to glamorize your ‚Äúhard‚Äù side a little too much given the circumstances.. stay humble.  
He‚Äôs probably from Texas or Florida. Either way happy chuck norris I‚Äôll handle this now gun slinger. Glad you got caught and served your heard earned wel deserved time.  
did you & your gf end up having another kid?  
I didnt have any grandparents growing up, and as someone who is deeply interested in history ive always wished I could sit down and have a cup of tea with my grandma and listen to all her life stories! Would you like to join me for some virtual tea and cake and tell me your favourite memory from when you were my age? (f22)  
Let‚Äôs see. 22. Oh my sweet child. Lol  When I was 22 I was literally a vagabond. I decided that I should spend some time adventuring, so that‚Äôs what I did. It wasn‚Äôt a popular decision at the time, but who the hell is going to stop me from doing it? Not a soul. So, I would pick up work in a town, which was enough to get me to another town and on it went.  I met the most amazing people during that time. Artists and musicians and diner owners and farmer‚Äôs wives. I really went out there and did it.  And I learned to be cold and hungry and self sufficient and happy. Lovely days those were. ‚ù§Ô∏è  
I can't imagine being able to just pick up work in a town, you know? I'm 29. It takes me 2-3 months to find a job on the internet.  
I know. Those were back in the days when you could just walk into a business and ask if they had any work. It so frustrating that so many people in my generation don‚Äôt understand how drastically different it is now before they start judging...  
I would have LOVED to do what you did. I have such a deep need for adventure. Before the pandemic, I was going to start taking a train into Chicago for Equity theatre auditions. Then I was going to move to LA to further my scene career... Sigh. Now I get to just stay home. Yayyyy. At least the internet makes staying home a little more bearable.  
‚ÄúCold and hungry and self sufficient and happy.‚Äù   Yep.  Nothing more liberating than seeing and feeling the fruits of your own efforts.  You rock Grandma!!!  I‚Äôd have a beer (or coffee) with you any day.  üíó‚úåÔ∏è thank you for taking the time to brighten so many youngsters‚Äô days.  
Hi grandma! I'm living in a foreign country now and suddenly came down with a terrible case of exhaustion a few months ago which put me in a wheelchair. I'm looking for some recipes for comfort food to eat when you're feeling sick and/or feeling blue. Have any good ones?  My husband is a great cook, so it doesn't have to be something I  personally (who can't stand in front of a stove) can make!  
I‚Äôm sorry to hear that, baby. The best comfort food of all time is homemade baked Mac and Cheese. I‚Äôd send you a link but it‚Äôs fairly straight forward with Mr. Google. Add more cheese. Gooey. Warm. Delightful.  Wishing you well, sweetie.  
Would you mind sending me the link too? Homemade Mac and Cheese is my number one favourite comfort food. I already have a great recipe but I'm always excited to try new ones :)  
Not OP but this is an excellent yet super simple base recipe. (as an aside: Betty Crocker recipes are fairly standard but they're foolproof if you follow them correctly, and often an excellent starting point if you like to experiment a bit.) We prefer a saucier mac, so when I make this I usually cut back on the pasta by about a quarter cup. It might look soupy at first but after it's been in the oven, the pasta absorbs some of the moisture and it's perfect.  The critical advice: Instead of using all cheddar, try 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 smoked gouda, and add a good dollop of sour cream to the sauce.  It's also ok to be a little heavier-handed with the salt and pepper, and even the Worcestershire. IMO the dry mustard is take it or leave it. Top it with a layer of panko before popping it into the oven. Heaven. I made my gouda version for a party and, no lie, people argued over taking home the leftovers. They passed up leftover cake in favor of mac and cheese, LOL.  
Hi! Culinary arts student here. Sorry for any mistakes, I'm not a native speaker. I was given an improved mac n cheese recipe that you might enjoy. Best one I've had so far and haven't seen a similar one You need 1/2 a pound of the tiniest elbow macarroni you can find, cooked (you can also buy directly boxed mac n cheese and use those noodles) 3/4 cup whole milk About a cup of whipping cream 3-4 thick strips of bacon, diced 3-4 thick slices of pork leg ham, or the ham of your choice, diced 1/2 a cup of each, cheddar, monterrey jack, and mozzarella cheese, grated (you can use any other cheese of your choice, those are just my suggestions, or you can use just two types of cheese if you're a bit on a budget) 1/4 cup of powdered parmesan cheese (I mean the not fresh one that comes in this grainy, almost powdery form, the classic one they use at cheap pizza places) 3/4 cup breadcrumbs Chives, for garnish Proceidure Mix and set aside 1/4 cup of the breadcrumbs and a small handfull of each cheese, including the parmesan. Mix the rest of the ingredients into a bowl until you form an even, paste like mixture. I recommend the macarroni to be al dente so that they don't break at this stage. Pour the mixture into a greased baking tray (I use a glass pyrex and it works wonders), even it out, and pour the cheese and breadcrumbs mix on top. Cover with aluminum foil. Bake at 180¬∞C (350¬∞F) for 10-12 minutes, then remove the foil and bake at 200¬∞C (390¬∞F) for about 8-10 minutes or until the top becomes golden brown. Take out of the oven, garnish with chives, and enjoy! Let me know if you try them :D I hope this is useful  
You're adorable.  I have 2 questions.  I love someone to death and she is my best friend. Her highschool is total shit and I am effraid she feels really down. She is the kind of person to not want to put her friends into her problems (english isn't my mane language so it might not be very cleaver) but I really want to do my best if I can help her. Do you have any idea? Other question: Do you have any recipe of chocolate and peach cake? I like recipes. (Without any robots except an electric egg mixer because I don't have any robots or machines to make food)  
If you‚Äôre just starting to bake cakes, literally use the Betty Crocker cookbook. They‚Äôre all online now, and they‚Äôre really self explanatory. You can make them all without any fancy equipment. As far as your friend goes, my only advice is all you can do. Just be there. Just be there to listen if she wants to talk, and let her know that you care.  
Thank you grandmother! I'll check this book out.  And I will try to be here for her as much as I can! It makes me feel like I'm not doing enough but maybe it is...  
Hey, you're absolutely doing enough. I've been on both sides of that situation, needing help and giving it. Without fail, the person in trouble needs someone who cares about them, someone who loves them dearly, someone who can pick them up whenever they fall down, even just someone to talk to. The fact that you're here asking how to help makes me think that you are that person, and that you can help. Take care of your friend, ok? Edit: forgot to mention this, but you said your friend doesn't like involving others in her problems, right? I would suggest not to ask them how you can help, because then they'll most likely refuse the help. Just do whatever you can, and if they ever try to refuse you can say that you're helping because you want to help. If your friend ends up asking for help, what could happen is they think they're forcing you to help them, which is why I'm saying to skip the asking them how you can help, and just skip straight to the helping, in whatever way that may be that you can help.  
Thank you very much. This advice is very good. I was thinking that asking her to give her help would not be a good idea because of this reason but I was lost. I'll keep being here for her. Thank you.  
Haha ‚Äúwithout any robots‚Äù blessed post  
I don't know how to explain myself better than this sorry haha  
Its ok. we understand, and It is really cool when people can speak multiple languages.  
Ok so im not a teenager but im interested in your recipes. üòÄWhat is your favourite recipe?  
Just ooi, does kiddos mean teens in the US? I am 36 with two tiny humans but assumed I would be included as I still sit at the kids table at Christmas for being the youngest sibling  
Kiddos means anyone younger than me, so that‚Äôs a wiiiide birth. Smooches, kiddo.  
My favorite recipe is for strawberry cobbler. It‚Äôs my favorite recipe because you get to just mix common ingredients in a bowl, and throw some strawberries on top of that shit and boom. 45 minutes later you have a desert that you‚Äôd be proud to take anywhere. It‚Äôs my favorite cheat. best cheat ever  
Yeah this is definitely a teenager pretending to be an old lady.  
Throw some strawberries on top of that shit and boom üòÜüëå‚ù§. I love this much.  
I never thought i would hear a granny say shit. Lifes good  
My mom turned 69 this year (obligatory "nice.") and she is both the sweetest and most badass woman I know. This generation of ex-hippy grannies is AMAZING!  
I can never get custard right, either never thickens up or turns into scrambled eggs. Can you help me? Edit: I did it! Using a double boiler and cream instead of milk made an amazing smooth custard! Thank you everyone for your great tips!  
Gonna weigh in here as a pastry chef, there's two primary types of egg based custard that immediately come to mind: cr√®me anglaise and cr√®me patissiere. Creme anglaise is thickened only with the protein and fat from the egg yolk and is actually meant to be sorta thin, like a melted icecream sorta sauce. Creme patissiere has either flour or starch added to the egg yolks and sets firm, much like pudding. The process people are talking about here is called tempering your eggs, and will prevent the scramble! I cook my custard in a pot over low flame. Hope this helps!  
What I'm trying to make is custard tarts, but I think I also got my proportions wrong. I was trying to divide a much larger recipe and something got lost along the way  
Are you using a double boiler? That‚Äôs the trick. Slow, steady, indirect heat while you gradually add components while you whisk like your life depends on it.‚ù§Ô∏è  
Thank you, wise grandma. I soon will have great custard  
teenager frantically googles ‚Äúcustard won‚Äôt thicken‚Äù to keep the role play going  
Not OP, but add a little bit of the hot milk mixture into the eggs in stages while whisking constantly to temper them before adding to the pot.  Should stop scrambling.  
Tried that, thats how I get a mixture that won't thicken :/  
Hmm.  Totally cheating, but you could maybe add about a tablespoon of corn starch?  
Ambrosia or asda pre made here in the UK. Less than ¬£1, better than any homemade I've ever had  
how do grandmothers make their houses so cozy? also, what‚Äôs the best place you‚Äôve ever visited, and why should i go?  
idk about you but my grandma  house when she still alive is near beach and its so fucking hot outside but inside i really cool and cozy,but after her death that house become uncomfortable and hot,so i always think that makes grandma house is so cozy is the grandma herself.  
Houses become homes if you give them some love.  You live in a house, but you build a home. My favorite place in the world is Glacier Park in Montana.  I was born and raised in the vast nothingness and everything that is the mountains of Montana. 5 out of 5, would reincarnate.  
From Kalispell myself! It is a beautiful place  
Woooooo...love me some MT! Dad‚Äôs in Great Falls, family all over-White Sulfur, Townsend, Elliston, Deer Lodge...all the big cities. ;)  
I always wanted to go to Lake McDonald there, what are some fun activities that you can do there.  
I was in Montana for a wedding last year. I dream of the mountains and going back. Everywhere is an oil painting.  
I visit the Waterton side every time I visit my Canadian grandparents! It‚Äôs beautiful!  
Funny, I was just missing my own grandmother (she lives halfway across the world). What is something that brings you joy?  
Flowers. Birds. Poetry. Music. Just lovely little things. My stupid, stupid but lovable animals. I swear to god if I ever had a smart animal the Universe would implode.  
Haha aw. Also, dogs or cats? If so, favorite breed?  
All of the animals. Just...all of them. I‚Äôve had goats, chickens, pigs, rabbits, snakes, you name it, I had it. And I guarantee you it was adorable and dumb as a stone. I seem to attract those  
Honestly my sister and I recently became grandmas and you sound like a mix of us both.We too have had ALL of the animals (apart from spiders, a mutual line in the sand lol) over the years, love to relax with a good book etc. I think as we get older our ability to see the great in the little things and just appreciate things and people for what and who they are becomes more important as we learn all the stuff we used to chase was just not important.  Hope you keep healthy and well through the current madness and as we know all to well, this too shall pass, and if it doesn't we'll cope with that too. Enjoy everyday and thanks for doing this, such a nice thing to do for total strangers.  
That's so cute. You seem so sweet. Thanks for making my day!  
This is why I know you're lying.  Nobody who has ever had goats has ever said they liked them even a little bit lmao  
What's your favourite type of music (or artist)? I'm 22 but I absolutely love the old rock from the 50s.  
I‚Äôve always liked rock the best. Zeppelin was a big favorite. But then I got a whole new set of artists in the 90s that I really liked. I‚Äôm lucky to have good kids that turned me onto Nirvana and the Pixies as they knew I might like it. Love me some Pixies...  
how do you feel about Frank Black's solo stuff?  Los Angeles is a jam  
Whats a favorite musician/band of yours that seems largely forgotten now?  
I thought you said Flurry was smart?  
The only smart animals that I've ever had ended up being completely evil. They can break in or out of everything. My current evil cat is still my baby, but he really is a jerk.  
What advice would you give to an teenager?  
Just remind yourself that it‚Äôs okay. Everyday and everything seems like an insurmountable obstacle at some times. It‚Äôs not.  Don‚Äôt forget that you‚Äôre a part of a lovely world. Find beauty in the little things.  
I saved this comment for future reference. I had a really crappy day today but reading this literally reinvigorated me on the spot almost.  
Sometimes even the comfort of your own bed is enough to make a horrible day better.  
I‚Äôm not the one who asked you but thank you for saying this. It really does help to hear  
Thank you, this is really something I needed to hear right now  
I swear grandmas are so sweet thank you  
Absolutely love this tip. No matter how bad a day I‚Äôm having, the smallest of things make it better.  
What's the most interesting technological advancement you have seen?  
Cell phones. By far.  I‚Äôve always enjoyed computers and coding, but if you had told me back in 1980 that I would have this processing power while sitting on my porch, I would have thought you were bananas. Like, we should probably call a professional level of bananas...  
That's really cool! I'm only fifteen years old, is there anything I should know that you wish you had known at fifteen?  
Just remember for all of life‚Äôs frustrations, there is literally beauty all around you. I bet you could find something pretty around you right now. It might be a color you really like, or a smell, or the way the light is shining through your window.  Just always find the beauty.  
Thank you nice old granny. It's been nice to talk to you!  
To everyone reading this, cherish people like this. I lost my mamaw (southern for grandma) a few years back and it's a hole that can never be filled. Greatest grilled cheese and homemade ice cream ever.  
Love you, honey. Truly.  
I read that in her voice. Thank you. I love you more!!  
Ditto.  Streams of tears are flowing as I read her responses and think of my dear mawmaw who just passed in December. Nothing can take her place. Glad for those who still have time.  
What was the most memorable historical event in your  life?  
Sadly, 9/11.  It was terribly surreal, and I think most everyone knows where they were when it happened. I wish it was something more jovially cool. Like where I was when first I watched Bob Ross...  
I miss Bob Ross and his happy clouds  
I was 13 and I remember that day as if I had just got home from school, that afternoon.  I already have a terrible memory. But this still burns, with loads of detail, in mind.  
This might be weird, but I lost my grandmother last year and I really miss hanging out with someone older. I used to volunteer at the old folks home in my hometown but now that I‚Äôm in college I find it a little difficult. I would really like to hang out with the elderly man next door but I don‚Äôt know how to go about it without being weird. Any advice?  
It‚Äôs not weird at all. Bring him a plate of cookies as a neighborly gesture and get a read how he feels about it.  
Can you share your favorite stew/soup recipe please  
My favorite is my maw maw‚Äôs potato chowder. It would take me forever to type it out, but this one is pretty close. Use real butter. No margarine.  Rip off Maw Maw Chowder  
Do you have any cool casserole recipes?  
Yaaaas. My winner for absolutely no nutritional value whatsoever but the best tasting casserole of all time is baked spaghetti. It‚Äôs just nonsense, but I‚Äôm never not in the mood for it.  Like, ever.sinful goodies  
Well, my grandma died from covid last months. I just wanna tell you to stay safe, and please keep spreading your good recipes! I love you üíï btw, what are some stuff grandpas like to talk about? Grandpa just moved with us, and he seems lonely and bored, can you suggest some topics?  
I think it depends on who your Grandpa is? Old people are just as individual as everyone else. Who is he? What does he like? Reach out to who he is and he‚Äôll reach back.  
I will stay safe. I‚Äôm masked up and fully sanitized at all time because I understand science. I‚Äôm so truly sorry to hear about your Grandma. Truly.  
As someone who works home health and deal with old people a lot, ask about his childhood and his parents. Most love to brag about shenanigans they got into when they were young. And there's almost always shenanigans.  
What's your favorite chicken recipe?  
BBQ in the oven. But there‚Äôs a way to do it juuuust right.  The trick is you just add the chicken to bbq sauce in a freezer bag and let it sit for an hour or so in the fridge. Then you cook it skin side up at about 400* until it‚Äôs cooked in the middle to 165* . But the magic is take it out and let it rest for about 5 minutes. Then flip it, put more bbq on it and BROIL it for 2 minutes. Take it out. Put BBQ on the top and broil it until crispy.  Best damned chicken ever  
Why do you think my grandmother is always negative and silently critical? She is 80 and lives with me. I feel guilty for not having more fun with her but I feel nervous when she walks into the room because I feel her judgement. We make everything so easy and nice for her. She won‚Äôt go anywhere or participate. What has happened?  
because she feels powerless and burdensome. Remember, she used to run a whole family and now she has no sense of purpose. Of course, she might've been judgemental her whole life but now she feels useless and no amount of "reassuring" will help. Instead of making everything flawless for her, ask her for help. Never imply she cannot do something anymore, instead change your thinking to "I couldn't do it without you". Whether it's whisking batter or helping with the wash, etc. Make it a little urgent, like, "I don't know how I'm going to get dinner on time if I don't get these towels done: You'd really be helping me out." And even if you know an answer, remember to ask her for advice. The loss of "being needed" is the greatest grief of all.  
That‚Äôs hard to say. Remember that people are just people. She may have been judgemental when she was younger too? I‚Äôm sorry that she won‚Äôt participate. Is there something she likes to do? A hobby or a game?  
Do you believe in God?  
I believe that we have very little idea how things work, so I think it would be presumptuous and egotistical to say yes or no with certainty. I just keep scooting along, trying to be a good person and enjoying the ride  
i am absolutely baffled by the fact that most person i can relate to is an internet grandma (which is cool but very surprising lol).  
Hey, my generation isn‚Äôt your Grandma‚Äôs Grandma. We went through the sexual revolution and psychedelics. We‚Äôre old. Not dead. Lol  
What‚Äôs your favorite psychedelic?  
Its so nice to see grandmas on Reddit. Could you please help me out with the basics of baking a cake from scratch because I can never seen to get it taste right?? :))  
My mum always taught me the method of half the amount of eggs as your ingredients in ounces. So you do 4 oz of butter and 4 oz of sugar, 2 eggs, 4 oz of (self-raising) flour but sieve it in slowly because you might not need all of the flour. Then you can add extracts, or cocoa powder (just make sure to add a little less flour if you add cocoa powder so it doesn't get too stiff). There's probably better recipes but it's always an easy one to remember if you're wanting to make one quickly.  
Use cake flower instead of all purpose and sift, sift, sift. ‚ù§Ô∏è  
Can I get a hug? I don't have a grandma anymore, and my mom died a few weeks ago. I really want a mom-like hug while I cry. :(  
Big old granny hug and a smooch to boot  
I lost all my grandparents before I turned 16. I turned 18 this year and I've been having a really rough time, health wise both mentally and physically. Do you have any words of inspiration and/or comfort?  
I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre coming of age in these times. That‚Äôs like rubbing salt in a wound. Just remember that it will be okay, in the long run. Find things you enjoy doing, and spend time doing those. Even if it‚Äôs just doodling. If there isn‚Äôt happiness around you, do your damnedest to make a wee bit. Love you  
What year were you born?  
Somewhere after 1920 and before 1980. No lady admits to their actual age, my love. üòâ  
We love talking to you! Could you give us some wisdom?  
Just enjoy your life, my dear. We worry too much about things we can‚Äôt change. Find the beauty that‚Äôs around you and don‚Äôt be quick to anger.  
What's one thing that made you laugh last week?  
My stupid dog ran into a beetle in the kitchen.  My dog is enormous. Think small horse sized. Lol. So, she ran into this beetle and had NO idea what to do. Just frantically running back and forth but completely unwilling to enter the kitchen with this stupid little beetle sitting there. I‚Äôm thinking, ‚Äúyou could take down a bear if you felt like it. But this is the deal breaker? A damned beetle?‚Äù  
This dog and my dog should never meet. The net IQ in the room would plummet into the negatives. But boy do I love big, dumb dogs.  
Is it a Dane? It sounds like a Dane. They are the biggest cowards. Source: I own Danes.  
Does fear of death ever go away as u get older  
I never really feared it. It certainly hasn‚Äôt gotten worse the closer I get to it. Like, I don‚Äôt mourn the fact that I don‚Äôt remember where I was before I was born or existed. So I think it will just be like that, you know? Going back to the source. No biggie. ‚ù§Ô∏è  
what is your favorite student recipe?  
Check up top for the cobbler recipe. It‚Äôs a good intro to baking and easy peazy lemon squeazy  
I'm a 30 year old childless bachelor, and at this time I am strongly leaning towards not having kids, but my parents are urging me to get married and have kids. What is your position on living a childless life? Is it wrong to not want kids?  
For what it's worth, I was the absolute same, without the lean. I was never, in a million years, having children. At 32 I fell absolutely head over heels for my bartender. At 35 I just bought a house with my wife and the most beautiful girl I've ever known - my 9 year old (step) daughter who is my whole damn world. You're old enough to know life tends to take you where it wants. Just be the best man you can be, and either it will or won't happen. Good luck man - when it comes to things like children, or your job, or marriage, the only wrong answer is the one you let someone else make for you.  
Not at all! You‚Äôre not a brood mare for heaven‚Äôs sake. It‚Äôs much worse to bring children into this world if you‚Äôre not 1000% on board. Only you know what‚Äôs better for you.  
Where do you get your grandma candy from? Like seriously does that shit just appear in a glass bowl when you get older?  
Hahaha. Right? The little strawberry candies with the ‚Äúgoo‚Äù always live in a dish in my home.  Now that I think about it, when in the actual he‚Äôll did I start buying those? Lolol  
Do you have a good kosher dill pickle recipe?  
No. I wish I did. I buy mine in the store because pickling shit is a pain in the arse.  I used to do it when I was younger, but now I‚Äôm like, ‚Äústore bought pickles as good‚Äù  
I lost my nana four months ago- she raised me to be a fierce, independent thinker and also managed to teach me the art of the backhanded compliment me at the same time (Jewish Bubbe, a lot of ‚ÄúOHHH shayna punim, you don‚Äôt look as thick in this outfit,‚Äù etc.) Anyway, thank you for being on here. And sorry if these have been asked before: How many grandkids do you have? Do you know a good brisket recipe?  And mostly: were you able to meet your own grandparents? If so, what were they like and what‚Äôs one thing you miss about one of them?  
I‚Äôm sorry you lost your Nana, but I‚Äôm super glad you have memories of her. That‚Äôs so wonderful. With brisket, the key is to sear it on the outside first. Just on a hot pan JUST until it browns. Turn it, and get all the sides brown. It locks in the moisture. Remember to let it rest before you carve it. I did know my Grandparents. My Grandmother was cold, but I forgive her. She had a rough life. My Papa was the absolute best. A gentleman among gentlemen.  But he was okay with me being a smart little tomboy. I adore him to this day.‚ù§Ô∏è  
Can I call you Grandma?  
As someone who‚Äôs older, you most probably experienced this more than once, how do you deal with grieving and loosing a loved one? Edit: (I meant no disrespect, lost a close friend recently)  
Time. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the only real answer. Just give yourself as much time as you need. It takes time to rebuild your new life knowing they won‚Äôt be a part of it.  
What is your favorite cheap recipe for dinner?  
Tuna casserole. For sure if you‚Äôre pinching pennies. Tuna, cream of mushroom soup, egg noodles, peas, crackers for the top. All cheap ingredients, but it‚Äôs always hearty and warm. ‚ù§Ô∏è  
Do you prefer coffee, tea or cocoa?  
Do you knit? If you do, how do you knit socks?  
I‚Äôm a shitty knitter. I have tried and tried and tried, so you most surely don‚Äôt want my advice lest you end up with 7 toes and no heel.  
Someone said something bad about my appearance today. Do you have any grandmotherly advice? I feel kind of bad.  
Let me tell you something. We ALL end up looking like wrinkled old Yodas in the end. Looks are fleeting, personality is forever. Just focus on being a beautiful person, okay?  
What is your biggest regret in life?  
I wish I would have traveled more. But it‚Äôs been a good life. I regret nothing, really.  
I never got to know my grandma-she passed away before I got to know her properly. A gentle hug to you, and it‚Äôs so cool you‚Äôre still on the Internet!  
Is there any advice you'd give to a teen worried if they'll be able to pursue their dreams? I don't know if I'm not working enough or I'm trying too much. Also, what's your favorite food to make when you're down or somebody else needs comfort? Any snack ideas? How did you choose your career?  
That‚Äôs a lot of questions. Lol.  First off, let me say that make sure the dreams you have are your dreams and not someone‚Äôs dreams for you.  That‚Äôs soooo important. I really like chips and queso when I‚Äôm feeling down. Why? No idea. I didn‚Äôt find what I was good at until I was much older than some. Remember that becoming yourself isn‚Äôt a race. As I grew older I knew lots of ‚Äúhighly successful ‚Äú people that were miserable. Give yourself a break, kiddo. Do your work well but relax a wee bit. ‚ù§Ô∏è  
Do you have any children?  
Three. Of varying ages, but all completely awesome sauce.  
You sound very cool and nurturing.  Being in my 40s I get similar vibes like I'm talking to my mother (who is totally awesome).  Good words you're giving to others.  Keep it up!  
She said she‚Äôs a grandmother so most likely lol  
I am a guy and grew up really close to my grandmother. She gave me my love for food - to eat and cook. I miss her quite a bit. While she didn't bake much, she gave me the love for being in a kitchen and led me to be an amateur / home baker. I would love to know your favorite recipe for 2 things:  Chocolate chip cookies Simple and quick cake   
This isn‚Äôt MY recipe, but it‚Äôs close-ish. Always add a bit of vanilla. Always. not Grandmas but close For cakes, you want to know the best cheat in the world? I learned this trick from an old Italian lady that made wedding cakes for a living.  You can do from scratch if you want, but if you add a box of instant (must be instant) pudding mix to the dry ingredients on a boxed cake mix, it will taste like you slaved over it. That‚Äôs it. Just dump a box of instant pudding mix in there. Unbelievable difference. Hope that helps. ‚ù§Ô∏è  
How are you?  
I‚Äôm fine thanks, honey. The weather has turned here and that‚Äôs wonderful. I can sit on my porch with my coffee and not feel like I‚Äôm in Dante‚Äôs Inferno  
how did u ever discover Reddit  
One of my kids told me that I might like it. They warned me about the bad parts, too. Lol

Please give me your cookie recipe.  
Are you really an old granny, I'm sceptical ü§îüòÇ  
I really am. Grey hair, thick old glasses and everything. Not all old people are mules, you know. We‚Äôre still people  
I know, I used to work in a nursing home even with some of the oldies in there they were always a good laugh, I used to help an old farmer get into bed at night and he would put 1 leg in the bed at a time, I used to joke with him about getting his leg over, it always used to make him giggle bless him, I used to love working there :) xx  
Do you have a recipe for meatloaf? For some reason I‚Äôve been craving it hard and I‚Äôve got some ground beef I‚Äôve been saving for it  
Are you accepting of LGBTQ people?  
Well, I better be because I‚Äôm a mom to one. Lol. Really though, I wish for my children to be honest, thoughtful, responsible and kind.  I could not care less what they want to do in the bedroom. Seems so stupid to me that anyone would care...  
How are you today  
Do you have a recipe for a casserole that doesn't involve condensed soup?

A person who I once really loved and trusted is now telling ugly lies about me so that his whole family hates me now for things I haven't done. It hurts a lot and I'm trying to ignore it and just move on. Can you give me advice?

What‚Äôs the best way for your kids to show you that you love them? I‚Äôm 30 and I‚Äôm noticing the aging in my dad and it‚Äôs so freaky. I live out of state so I don‚Äôt visit much and I‚Äôm super bad with emotional intimacy with family so I show everything through gestures (thoughtful gifts, surprise visits)

Poetry. Music. Just lovely little things.  My stupid, stupid but lovable animals. I swear to god if I ever had a smart animal the Universe would implode. Here   Ok so im not a teenager but im interested in your recipes. üòÄWhat is your favourite recipe? My favorite recipe is for strawberry cobbler. It‚Äôs my favorite recipe because you get to just mix common ingredients in a bowl, and throw some strawberries on top of that shit and boom. 45 minutes later you have a desert that you‚Äôd be proud to take anywhere.  It‚Äôs my favorite cheat. best cheat ever Here   Do you believe in God? I believe that we have very little idea how things work, so I think it would be presumptuous and egotistical to say yes or no with certainty.  I just keep scooting along, trying to be a good person and enjoying the ride Here   how do grandmothers make their houses so cozy? also, what‚Äôs the best place you‚Äôve ever visited, and why should i go? Houses become homes if you give them some love.  You live in a house, but you build a home.  My favorite place in the world is Glacier Park in Montana.  I was born and raised in the vast nothingness and everything that is the mountains of Montana. 5 out of 5, would reincarnate. Here   what is your favorite student recipe? Check up top for the cobbler recipe. It‚Äôs a good intro to baking and easy least lemon squeazy Here   What was the most memorable historical event in your  life? Sadly, 9/11.  It was terribly surreal, and I think most everyone knows where they were when it happened.  I wish it was something more jovially cool. Like where I was when first I watched Bob Ross... Here   Hi grandma! I'm living in a foreign country now and suddenly came down with a terrible case of exhaustion a few months ago which put me in a wheelchair. I'm looking for some recipes for comfort food to eat when you're feeling sick and/or feeling blue. Have any good ones?  My husband is a great cook, so it doesn't have to be something I  personally (who can't stand in front of a stove) can make! I‚Äôm sorry to hear that, baby. The best comfort food of all time is homemade baked Mac and Cheese. I‚Äôd send you a link but it‚Äôs fairly straight forward with Mr. Google.  Add more cheese. Gooey. Warm. Delightful.  Wishing you well, sweetie. Here   Can you share your favorite stew/soup recipe please My favorite is my maw maw‚Äôs potato chowder. It would take me forever to type it out, but this one is pretty close. Use real butter. No margarine.  Rip off Maw Maw Chowder Here   What's the most interesting technological advancement you have seen? Cell phones. By far.  I‚Äôve always enjoyed computers and coding, but if you had told me back in 1980 that I would have this processing power while sitting on my porch, I would have thought you were bananas. Like, we should probably call a professional level of bananas... Here   Do you have any cool casserole recipes? Yaaaas.  My winner for absolutely no nutritional value whatsoever but the best tasting casserole of all time is baked spaghetti.  It‚Äôs just nonsense, but I‚Äôm never not in the mood for it.  Like, ever.sinful goodies Here   Do you prefer coffee, tea or cocoa? Coffee with milk. üôÇ Here   Do you have any children? Three. Of varying ages, but all completely awesome sauce.

Greatest grilled cheese and homemade ice cream ever. Love you, honey. Truly. Here   Its so nice to see grandmas on Reddit. Could you please help me out with the basics of baking a cake from scratch because I can never seen to get it taste right?? :)) Use cake flower instead of all purpose and sift, sift, sift. ‚ù§Ô∏è Here   Are you really an old granny, I'm sceptical ü§îüòÇ I really am. Grey hair, thick old glasses and everything. Not all old people are mules, you know. We‚Äôre still people Here   Where do you get your grandma candy from? Like seriously does that shit just appear in a glass bowl when you get older? Hahaha. Right? The little strawberry candies with the ‚Äúgoo‚Äù always love in a dish in my home.  Now that I think about it, when I‚Äôm the actual he‚Äôll did I start buying those? Lolol Here   What is your biggest regret in life? I wish I would have traveled more. But it‚Äôs been a good life.

Hi! As a teen who loves cooking, what recipe would you recommend for me to make for my entire family?  
Hi! Not OP but as another young adult who likes cooking, I recommend roast beef, jambalaya, or sushi. Theyre all relatively easy and I find people are always very appreciative of them. They're my go-to for impressing relatives haha. That being said, try new things every chance you get! I recently got a spiralizer and wanted to use it to make something, but I wasn't wanting pasta, so I just spiralized potatoes and dumped them in a pan to fry. They ended up being DELICIOUS. I've found that being a little free with recipes tends to lead to better results, I came up with my jambalaya recipe by following a pinterest recipe but changing a few spices and ingredients.  
I agree that jambalaya is a great place to start. It‚Äôs almost impossible to mess up if you‚Äôve practiced it once or twice and it tastes amazing. It‚Äôs a good starter.  Also, everyone should know how to make a nice meatloaf.  
Good recipes, you say? Have you checked out r/Old_Recipes? I'm sure they'd love to see them.  
What are your views on video games?  
Does anyone else think this would be the best granny to talk to irl? Love the replies!

Well, you should follow his eye movements more than his hand movements which will help you predict where he‚Äôs gonna work next and you can stay one step ahead, it takes a while but once you get it it‚Äôs easy.

How‚Äôd you go about finding the screwdriver he asked you to get from the different drawer he told you they were in?  
That I can‚Äôt escape xD, it‚Äôs my fault he forgot where the screwdriver is and I get wrecked xD. But now I‚Äôm used to where the tools are so it‚Äôs not too bad  
Which is superior, angle of the beam or overall brightness?  
I‚Äôd say the angle of the beam, as long as the spot he‚Äôs working on is lit and he has no problem working on it, it‚Äôs fine  Even a phone flash is bright enough for most cases  
What repairs was he doing?  
He takes on projects and restores antique cars for the clients, honestly I don‚Äôt know much about what he does xD. He was working on the engine as that‚Äôs what he mostly does  
ask him to teach you.. youll thank yourself and him later for learning that skill. plus it‚Äôs a very good bonding experience  
Tell us your secrets, oh wise one!  
Practice, years and years of practice!!  
POINT THE LIGHT WHERE MY HANDS ARE WORKING. As for the question, did you have to hold a ladder for anything? That would be amazing not to screw up both things!  
Honestly, how can you screw up holding the ladder?  Ok I just realised, in India the ladder you use is not double sided you know, so one end is leaning on the wall so there‚Äôs not many ways you can screw it up....unless you want to  
How did it make you feel when it was over  
I was actually happy but I couldn‚Äôt boast about it to anyone xD, so I got on my phone all proud and posted it here  
How many years did it take for you to master this art, before achieving this without any complaints? Are there any caveats or things to consider before starting a career as dad's worst torchlight holder? Obviously, one should know just as much about the process of the task at hand as dad, but apart from that, do you have any other pro tips on how to master it? For the ones here in the thread that are the father of a son and who want to hold on to this tradition, what can we do to pass this on to our sons effectively? Is it really only about making them feel like a disappointment and about blaming them for any problems that arise during the procedure or is there more to it?  
Translation for Americans "torch"=flashlight  
i really thought this post was about some tribal fire ritual...smh  
I began to think about the Olympic torch  but holding the flashlight in a time like that, is just as important. I salute you.  
Imagine the Parliament song "Flashlight" if it came from the UK. ‚ô´ ~ .... toRCH ~ ‚ô™  
Thanks, that‚Äôs very disturbing.  
Lol, I just tried to sing it that way, and you ain't lying! ü§£  
Lol  
South East Asian here. Where I'm from we call it torchlight. Makes sense? lol.  
woah I never knew Americans had a different name for torches. I mean where I‚Äôm from we used both so I figured  
We call them flashlights. Because they aren‚Äôt actual torches, as in they aren‚Äôt burning pieces of tree giving off huge flames and smoke.  
We call them torches. Because they don't actually flash, as in they don't give out brief pulses of light by discharging a high voltage through a partially-evacuated tube with some xenon gas in it.  
We call them djeuhjeueu. Because they don‚Äôt actually oypulgirk, as in they don‚Äôt qtqtatdydhetdjgjrkdjgnkdjdhdjrjrj  
Some flashlights do pulse, some even pulse in Morse code for sos, very helpful if you need to get someone's attention without noise and you don't want them to think it's just a normal flashlight.  
Well, they do flash because the only proper way to use one is to turn it on for 0.1 seconds 2 inches away from your friends face after their eyes have acclimated to the darkness for an hour.  
We call them ‚Äòzaklamp‚Äô, which means pocketlight. There is so much wrong with the Dutch language.  
You might be right, but by definition a flashlight isn't a "torch" either.  
Might wanna google the definition of flash, lad.  
I am imagining an actual medieval torch, like a tree branch with a kerosene-soaked rag on it blazing up all kinds of flames.  
Not to be confused with Fleshlight.  
Unless you‚Äôve got the multifunction model  
Took me a second  
No no no He just held a fucking egyptian illumination item Keep it that way  
That‚Äôs because no American dad would let this happen. There‚Äôs always something you‚Äôre doing wrong (in their eyes)  
Then what to you call torches?  
Tbh it‚Äôs cooler if you just imagine it‚Äôs a normal torch  
I solely know this from watching Top Gear.  
What do other people call wooden torches? Sounds weird now. The kind that is a stick on fire, what is that called?  
Oh....thank you....that cleared my confusion .....  
He's too dangerous to be left alive

My Dad always used to shit on me when I helped, usually it was in a very friendly manner and I think he just enjoyed the interactions a whole lot. Your post reminded me of those times, so thank you!  
Interesting. Dad here, trying to figure out how to shit on my son in a friendly manner to create happy memories.  
Firstly, you are wholesome and with your attitude im sure your Son knows how much you love him. My Dad was a very loud man, and he could project well, he would often rib me about missing the spot he was working on with the light, and as I got a little older, he could get more creative with his insults. However i always knew it was jovial and not actually warranted. The memories are equal parts humour from his little chirps, learning about old school rock, and just the time and energy he put into our relationship. Even though he had 3 kids, he always had time for us as individuals too which made us love him that much more. I hope this helps Sir, and I wish you all the best and happiness with your Son!

Can I have my dad back?  
Holding the light without getting yelled at is pretty much impossible. So even though I want to believe, I just can't. Get your fantasy stories out of here.  
The ultimate gift for any dad is a magnetic base flashlight. This will strengthen the father/son bond and prevent any future angry conversations for sure.

I'm gonna need you to talk me through the whole timeline of this, your majesty.  
So this saga started on Wednesday. I called at my lunch hour around 1:45PM EST and asked to cancel my membership, the receptionist told me only the Operations Manager can cancel memberships and she is on lunch. I asked when she would be back, and was told 2:30PM. I called back at 2:45PM and was told she was still at her lunch. I called one final time on Wednesday at 4PM and was told by a different receptionist the same line of "Only an Operations Manager can cancel memberships and she is on lunch." I left a message with her and waited for a call.   At 3PM on Thursday I called once again and was told the same line. (Call 4) Me: "That is fine, I will hold until she gets back." Receptionist 1 (R1): "Are you sure? It might be a while." Me: "Yep I will wait." --- 5 Minutes Later--- Operations Manager (N): "Hi this is Naomi, how can I help you?" Me: "Hi Naomi, I would like to cancel my membership." N: ‚ÄúWe only cancel membership in person between the hours of 10AM and 3PM, Monday through Friday.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt going to work for me Naomi, I work.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúWell you can send in a form, but that can take weeks to process.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúNo, you are not charging me for extra time, we are going to cancel this now.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI cannot do that.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù N: ‚ÄúBecause we cannot verify who you are over the phone.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúBut you can through mail?‚Äù N hangs up.   I immediately call back. (Call 5) R1: ‚ÄúHi, this is LA Fitness, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúPlease redirect me to Naomi, thank you.‚Äù --- Hold for 10 minutes --- N: ‚ÄúThis is Naomi, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi Naomi, it seems like our call dropped, this is BabstheBeagle again. I would like to cancel my membership.‚Äù   -  Side Note: I know the call didn‚Äôt drop, I just have worked in customer service before and know that a nice person is more likely to get their way. N: ‚ÄúAs I said, we only do that through person or through the mail, I will not be able to help you today.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúYes you will Naomi, I will continue calling until you are able to. I know you can.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI was trained in December and that will not be happening.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúYes it will be, I do not care who you have to call to make this happen.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI will not be canceling this membership over the phone.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúThen we will be..‚Äù Boop, N hangs up again Me: ‚Äúspeaking a lot today.‚Äù     Call 6 R1: ‚ÄúHi this is..‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúTransfer me to Naomi.‚Äù Boop, R1 hangs up.     Call 7 ‚Äì 10 The receptionist never answered my call, they just put me on hold. I work in an open office space so all my coworkers have heard me trying to cancel this membership at this point. I borrow a coworker‚Äôs phone and call back. (Call 11) R1: ‚ÄúHi, this is LA Fitness, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi, can I speak to the Operations Manager?‚Äù R1: ‚ÄúSure! Let me transfer you.‚Äù --- Naomi almost immediately answers --- N: ‚ÄúThis is Naomi, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi Naomi, this is BabstheBeagle again.‚Äù Boop, N hangs up.   This is where I start to have fun. I borrow multiple coworkers phones, calling back and asking for Naomi. After 4 more calls, they eventually get me to Naomi. At this point it is around 4:50PM. (Call 12) N: ‚ÄúHi BabstheBeagle, you know I cannot cancel this.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúNaomi, you must know that I will not stop calling until you do. Why again can‚Äôt you cancel this over the phone?‚Äù N: ‚ÄúBecause I cannot verify who you are.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúI will shoot you a text with my fingerprints, face, nostrils, I will even buy you plastic surgery so you cancel this for me.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI cannot.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúPlease transfer me to your manager.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI already spoke to him, I am not allowed to cancel this.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúI do not care if you spoke to him, transfer me now.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI will not be doing that. Have a nice day.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúNAOMI DO NOT HANG UP ON ME.‚Äù Boop, she is gone again.    Call 13 ‚Äì 15 they keep on ignoring me.    Call 16 ‚Äì 5:01PM Receptionist 2 (R2): ‚ÄúHi, this is LA Fitness, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúI am just trying to cancel my membership.‚Äù R2: ‚ÄúWell we are unable to do that, only the operations manager can and she just left for the day.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúI do not care, I will continue to call until you find someone that can cancel this membership.‚Äù R2: ‚ÄúI am here until 10:30PM, talk to you soon.‚Äù Boop, hung up on again.    There is a funny thing about LA Fitness call system. When they put you on hold a message pops up saying ‚ÄúThank you for calling LA Fitness, your call means a lot to us, we will answer you shortly.‚Äù Every time I heard ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù I hung up and called again. This was purely to make sure that their phone was constantly ringing. This happened for call 17 ‚Äì 24.   Call 25 Ross (GM): ‚ÄúHi BabstheBeagle this is Ross, you have been told that we can‚Äôt cancel your membership unless the Operations Manager does it. She is no longer here. I am the General Manager and I can‚Äôt even do it.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi Ross, I have talked to your Operations Manager multiple times, I will continue calling tonight unless you cancel this membership. If you can‚Äôt do it, find someone who can.‚Äù GM: ‚ÄúGive me a minute.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúSure Ross.‚Äù --- Hold for a minute or two --- GM: ‚ÄúAlright BabstheBeagle, this is the number of another location. The OM named Caleb is expecting your call and he will cancel your membership.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúThank you Ross, you are clearly the only one there with brain cells.‚Äù GM: ‚ÄúHave a good one.‚Äù   Call 26 Receptionist 3 (R3): ‚ÄúHi, this is LA Fitness, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi, I am calling for Caleb, he is expecting my call.‚Äù R3: ‚ÄúYep, he is just with a client right now, please hold for a minute.‚Äù --- Hold for a bit --- Caleb (C): ‚ÄúHi BabstheBeagle, how can I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi Caleb, you have to cancel my membership.‚Äù C: ‚ÄúHave to?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúDo you know how I got to you?‚Äù C: ‚ÄúYes, you wouldn‚Äôt stop calling.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúWhat makes you think that will change just cause you tell me no.‚Äù --- Long Pause --- C: ‚ÄúAlright, let me verify some information and I will cancel this for you.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúYou are a saint among ding dongs.‚Äù   Caleb proceeded to unhappily cancel my membership. This call ended at approximately 5:30PM.  I did not curse once, but I think every employee at LA Fitness hates me now and I couldn‚Äôt care less.    Also sorry if this is horrible to read. I am a sucky writer and honestly have no intention of getting better. Edit: Formatting for easier reading  
 ‚ÄúThank you Ross, you are clearly the only one there with brain cells.‚Äù  Worked at LA Fitness for a year.  The one's with brain cells are the ones that turn over and find a new job the quickest.  
Clearly! My coworker used to work there and she said they definitely could cancel it over the phone.  
They either turn over, or they're sociopathic enough to advance in management with that company. Ross will probably be gone within a month.  Caleb is probably a calculating sociopath.  
Looking at L.A. Fitness' website, the cancellation song and dance requires a form which you can only access from your LA Fitness member online account to print.  Then they recommend you have to send via certified mail (because L.A.F is very careless with their mail, apparently) or obtain a receipt (yeah right...) from the Ops Mgr if you hand deliver it.  Even then, they might accidentally still bill you, in which case you need to notify them and they'll reimburse you, after you provide them proof.   What if I want to join, tho?  I can sign up online right now on their website with a credit card.   This is flat out dishonest business practice.   Thank you for sharing your experience, /u/BabstheBeagle.  If L.A. Fitness becomes the only gym left in the world, you have convinced me that I will never join.  This kind of sham practice needs to end and this franchise can go to hell.  
I was once being harassed by a gym to update my information. They were reaching out to me to ask me to pay some annual membership fee. I told them I hadn't been to the gym in a year and wasn't going to. They said that the fee was still required. I asked them if they had my credit card information. They said no, and I said "Good bye" and hung up.  
SiruisXM got that treatment from me. When I was on the fence about renewing, I changed the saved card info to one of those virtual card numbers you can get from your bank that's only good for a month. I called up a few weeks before the subscription ran out and told them to cancel it when the current sub ran out.  Almost as soon as the sub ran out, they called me asking for payment info. I told them "no thanks" and hung up on them.  
Every year I call SiriusXM and ask to cancel.  When they ask why, I say "I have other streaming music options, and my budget is $X (whatever XM's trial / initial rate is.). I'd like to keep you guys, but $Y (the normal rate) just isn't worth it to me.  I'll be happy to renew at $X, though, and will pay for that in full right now.". Always works.  They are sneaky about it though.  Three months before it's about to expire, you'll get an email saying "your trial expires in 90 days, at which point you'll renew at $Y". They hope you forget and, once you lapse into the normal rate, I think you're screwed.  Just set a Outlook reminder or something.  My renewal happens to fall on 4/20, so pretty easy to not forget.  
 Also sorry if this is horrible to read. I am a sucky writer and honestly have no intention of getting better.  A sucky writer??? Not a chance, this entire story was riveting from start to finish, and I honestly laughed out loud a number of times.   
Tell that to every English teacher I have ever had.   
well, then you have improved immensely since then. This was great. Besides actually getting your membership cancelled, what was the most exciting part of all of this?  
Former English teacher here. I loved it.  
You should call them back and tell them you changed your mind. Let's see how much verification they need for that.  
So my friend wants to call them up and say "Hi I am BabstheBeagle, some one cancelled my account without my authorization."  I thought that was pretty funny.   
You should have a male friend call, or someone with a very thick Russian accent.  
Reminds me of the story of the guy trying to cancel his planet fitness membership and they threatened to call the cops if he didn't stop calling. After the cops got on the phone he got his membership cancelled.  
I was waiting for that to happen but we didn't get there.   
Make sure you save the time and date for the cancellation for when they bill you next month. They are going to bill you next month...  
This was amazing! I applaud your persistence and patience! PS - Did you really tell Caleb 'You are a saint among ding dongs'?  
Yes, I did. I might have said dinguses.   
Are you sure the plural isn't dingi?  
Be careful - I went through something similar but actually did show up in person - THREE TIMES. Each time "the manager was at lunch" They ended up promising me they cancelled it and didn't - so make sure you check your CC statements! for the story:  I asked "what time should I come back tomorrow that she will be here?" each time I came. I would show up that time the next day and wait for 30 minutes.  All three times she wasn't there. The third time "she was off today". I called out the girl in front of me "you told me she would be here by 3:00pm JUST YESTERDAY. I showed up again, in person, and I'm moving across the country tomorrow do you realize how ridiculous this is? I'm just trying to cancel my account. Please help me or find someone who can"  Yes - I was moving across the country THE NEXT DAY when I showed up on the third day. They were quite literally fucking me over. When I finally, politely, demanded they cancel it and they "had to call a manager from another location"  same fucking spiel you got! This was 3 years ago! Maybe 3.5.  Well after a short conversation he promised me he cancelled it over the phone. I thanked him. Then I was an idiot and didn't look close enough on my CC statement and didn't notice they kept charging me 49.99 or w/e it was for 10 months. Ugh.  I had to dispute it with my credit card company. They LIED to me, made it so impossibly difficult to cancel my account I had to show up and waste my time in person THREE TIMES, and still didn't cancel it.  Credit card company made them honor half, and I was still out 4-5 months of payments. They closed the case with no further inquiries allowed. Which is bullshit because I was 100% ripped off, and was not only lied to but not even able to use the product I paid for because I was told I was no longer a member by an official account manager.  Fuck LA fitness, and you're my hero dude.   
Saving for the next r/AskReddit ‚ÄúWhat terrible customer service story do we have to read?‚Äù I‚Äôll make sure to link and not copy/paste for credit   
I will never, ever get a membership there based on this post alone. Fuck you, Naomi.  
Well just avoid Naomi. Caleb and Ross fixed things pretty quickly.   
I bet you still get billed next cycle.  
DON'T YOU WISH THAT EVIL ON ME!  
[deleted]  
You can preemptively call your CC company and let them know what the situation is and to disallow any charges from them.  I'm sure they deal with bullshit from those gyms all the time.

NAOMI DO NOT HANG UP ON ME.  
I've been slowly letting them want to kick me out for a while now. I still use it but when I decide to stop they will already want me out. My plan is to go there and be prepared to sit at the desk till closing and when they say I have to leave I'll say not till my account is cancelled  
Keep this up for a few weeks, those pieces of shit deserve all the aggravation. Maybe send some glitter bombs too.  
I have thought of calling back Naomi and saying "I WON!! HAHA!" and then hang up but I really do not want her to uncancel my membership.   
Once cancelled, they cant enroll you again without permission. Please call Naomi and record it for us.  
Do it.   
What I don't understand is it the OM was the only  one with authority to cancel it, then why'd she keep saying she couldn't? I mean  she'd have to anyway if OP went in person, right? She wouldn't be able to deny OP then?  
For what its worth, neither my girlfriend or I had any issues with just sending in the cancellation form. Just send it certified mail (costs a couple bucks at the post office) so they can't claim they never got it. For both my girlfriend and I, our memberships were cancelled within a week of sending the form, didn't get charged anything extra.   
I shouldn't have to pay to cancel a membership though! That is ridiculous.  
I'm not disagreeing with you, cancelling in person or over the phone should be super easy and painless if LA Fitness weren't such a scummy organization.  That said, you did pay to cancel your membership though. In the time and stress it took to do this. Isn't $5 and a trip to a post office "cheaper" than what you had to do?   
What's Naomi's number? I would like to cancel something, maybe my best buy rewards card.   
When I called their corporate office to cancel they gave me an email address to use. I think they said it only worked in certain states. But I did get it cancelled by just sending one email! Crazy what you had to go through.   
I can only find an abbreviated clip of it,but if you find Ryan Hamilton‚Äôs comedy special Happy Face he has an amazing bit about cancelling gym memberships that I‚Äôm sure you would enjoy after this experience.  
I don't understand the point of the whole "You need an OPs manager to cancel but she is out" if the OPs manager is just going to tell you that you can not do it over the phone. Why doesn't the receptionist just open with that line? Seems like the OPs managers job is to just hang up on you if you somehow get in touch with her.  
Naomi, I've come to bargain.  
Reading this in Ryan Reynolds voice just makes it so much snarkier. Well done sir.  
...Or you could have sent a registered, certified letter, with your 'cancel-by' date, and called your bank to stop payments on that date. Would have taken less time and aggravation.  
Thanks to this story, I want "because I can't verify who you are" to be the next Reddit meme  
[deleted]  
Just out of sheer curiosity and the possibility of going to downvote hell....why couldn't you cancel in person?  
You should really contact your state AG about this scam.  
Upvote for shitty writer pride!! Represent!!  
You do realize that the argument 'I work' lost a little credence after that?  
Cancelling my Crunch membership tomorrow after my workout, hoping it won‚Äôt be this bad.  
What's their number? I'll call right now to a cancel aswell   
This brings back memories of trying to cancel my 24-hour fitness membership.  I went into the place on my lunch since it was near my work. Like you they said it had to be done by a manager, which they called over. When he got to the desk he asked the person I was talking to what the issue was. When they told the manager that I was looking to cancel membership the manager just shook his head no at them, never once acknowledged my presence, and walked away. The front desk lady gave me an 800 number to call.  Of course I was on hold for an hour. At the time I worked a retention line for a customer service team so I knew the game that was about to be played and spent the time on hold developing a plan.  CSR: Hello, how can I help you today? Me: Yes I need to cancel my membership. I tried to do it at the location but they said I had to call this number.  Verify some information to pull up the account.  CSR: now before I continue I have to enter your cancel reason.  Me: I have diabetes and in two months both my lower legs and one of my hand will be amputated. I will be going through an rehab program and I will not longer be able to use the equipment available at your gyms. Short but noticeable pause CSR: Are you sure you will no longer be needing your membership.  Me: Yes. CSR: Ok, I will get that cancelled for you now.  Of course I think this is over, but was I ever wrong.  I went on with life not giving it another though, until a month later when I got charged again. I went back into the local gym and they verified there was a note to cancel my account added on the date I called. So the lady at the front desk, the same one I had originally talked to, said that she would clear it up but was not allowed to refund the last payment. I was like whatever, I just want it over.  And again, the next month, boom I get hit with a charge.  It took several more calls and going into the local gym while having the same conversation before it was finally done.  I WILL NEVER EVER JOIN A GYM OR SUGGEST TO ANYONE THAT THEY JOIN A GYM. Every now an then 24 hour fitness will come to the office to try to sign people up with a discount. Every time they do I go to my HR department and tell them my story that I am very upset they are allowed to swindle others. A few times that has ended up with them being asked to leave.   
The simplest solution is to dispute the charge with the credit card company. They go back to the company charging you and make them prove they have the right to continue the charges. If the same thing happens with the same companies over and over, the CC companies will stop processing any payments to the gym.   
Exactly this. I have no idea why people bother with the bullshit. All you have to do is call Visa or whatever, and they'll send the attack dogs. It's one of the only advnttages to paying with your credit card.  
 I WILL NEVER EVER JOIN A GYM OR SUGGEST TO ANYONE THAT THEY JOIN A GYM.  It's times like this that make me so happy that my job has an on-site gym.   
The conclusion I came to was that a membership cost about $400 a year. For that you can easily by a set of weights and elliptical after a few years. It is a much better option if you can find the space, unless there are other reasons beyond the equipment.  
dafuq? i would have disputed every charge  
Yeah dispute it with your bank.  You can dispute charges within the last 60 days.  You'll be given provisional credit in the amount being disputed (usually with in a couple days).  Then you get to go on with your life. If you're wondering what goes on behind the scenes: When you complete the dispute paperwork with the bank it assigns the bank as your champion in the credit pits.  The banks employ some of the best pitfighters who will dispatch the paltry fighters the gym can put up.  Your name will be chanted by the crowds (because fuck shitty gyms) and great honors will be won by your champion.  
Yeah I would have never let them get away with charging me after I‚Äôve canceled   
This is amazing!  By the end of it I would have enlisted a friend and tried something like this: ---- Receptionist: "Hi, this is LA fitness, how can I help you?" Friend: "Hi, my name is $FriendName and I'm interested in signing up for a membership" Receptionist: "certainly, let me transfer you to our operations manager" Operations Manager (OM): "Hi this is Naomi, how can I help you?" Friend: "Hi, my name is $FriendName and I'm interested in signing up for a membership.  I just have a few questions about your membership plans. " OM: "certainly, how can I help you today? " Friend: "<generic questions about facilities, membership benefits, etc>" OM: "<describing facilities, membership benefits, other selling points> Do you have any other questions? " Friend: "yes, there is one more thing you can help me with.  Since I'm signing up over the phone, will I be able to cancel my membership over the phone if I need to in the future? " OM: "yes, absolutely" Friend: "excellent, this is my friend BabstheBeagle who would like to cancel her membership.  Go ahead Babs. " OM: "..." ‚Äã  
Oh my.  You have the patience of a saint. I had a situation where I signed up for a free trial at LA Fitness and they wouldn't stop calling me. Repeatedly. I told them I worked at night and was asleep during the day, and they needed to stop calling me because they were waking me up (true).  Apologies, we won't do it again, blah blah....but of course, they kept calling. One day, I had enough.  After they called (during the day again, of course), I looked up the state law on telephone harassment. I printed it, highlighted the relevant portions (of which they were in clear violation), and I drove to the gym.  I asked the receptionist where Mr. XYZ was (I forget his name now), and she points in a direction and says "...but he's on a call right now."  Doesn't matter - I remembered the guy from when I signed up for the trial, so I walked over to his desk and he gave me the "I'm on the phone" finger. I slammed the law printout down on his desk in front of him and walked out. I never heard from them again.   
so whats the number to Caleb?  
I'm confused about the "buy you plastic surgery" peice..? What were you suggesting? Getting her a boob job in exchange for cancelation?  
You are a hero. My LA Fitness forced me to cancel my membership via certified letter. Oh, and four months later I realized they were still billing my card monthly for their garbage personal trainer. The douche who flirted with chicks and ignored me during my paid hour. They were like ‚Äúoh that‚Äôll require another certified letter‚Äù Fucking awful company.  
I love you hahahaha holy shit  
What's amusing is they're so eager to sign you up over the phone. I went to an LA fitness with my sister a few weeks ago and they WON'T STOP CALLING.  So--good for you. This story made me laugh.   
Sister: I'm sorry, I can't join a gym over the phone. LA Fitness: Why not? Sister: Because I can't verify who you are.  
Sister: Only my mom can sign me up for a gym membership. LA Fitness: That is alright! Could you hand her the phone ne so we can finish your gym membership? Sister: Well, she's not home right now.   
THIS.  This, ultimately, is a reason I've used to ditch ANYONE spamming by phone. And it's a policy.  And to answer the next questions they've asked... ... Decided by Security ... Which meets quarterly ... At a location not generally advertised ... Which is policy.. ... Decided by Security... Etc.  And get off my phone kthx  
My old lecture in info security would make us laugh with tales of cold calls he received. He would ask "But how do I know you are human? Can you prove it..? That's exactly what a computer would say!"' This was over a decade ago and he died recently. RIP Mike.  
"You can only sign me up in person, from 1:00-1:12 Mondays, Wednesday, and every other Thursday, in the parking lot of my place of business."   
The only person that can sign me up is my Operations Manager and she's at lunch.   
I‚Äôm just going to say this from now on idc if they don‚Äôt get the context  
I have tried mutiple times to explain that to charities that call me. They just keep repeating the same "reassure potential donor" script that anyone could recite.   
I think here we have a law that says that cancelling any service must be as easiear as singing up. Can you sing up via phone? you can cancel it via phone  
Fun fact, my bank is the opposite. I tried to cancel my card in person because I lost my wallet and therefore my ID as well and they couldn't verify without I'd BUT I could walk into the parking lot and call and cancel with no verification  
I got rid of an investment bank calling every two weeks by swiftly unlearning how to language. As long they are only wasting your time they will keep at it. When they feel it's their own on the other hand...   
Yeah, sometimes I try to sell them something back. Sales people sometimes don't understand 'no' but they understand that another sales person is not a customer. OK your gym sounds great but what you guys really need is an ALKALINE WATER SYSTEM can I schedule an installation for your FREE TRIAL?  
Gyms are hilarious when trying to get your business, trying to play on your vanity and flirt with you to sign up.   
Yeah‚ÄîI‚Äôm in the military and have access to a free gym (a really, REALLY nice one) on base, about 20 feet from where I work. Absolutely not interested in paying for a membership, so watching their sales tactics in full force is entertaining in a masochistic sort of way.   
Time to sign Naomi up for several gym memberships.

 Me: ‚ÄúDo you know how I got to you?‚Äù C: ‚ÄúYes, you wouldn‚Äôt stop calling.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúWhat makes you think that will change just cause you tell me no.‚Äù  Well done. üëèüëèüëè  
Yeah but honorable mention to   You are a saint among ding dongs   
First glance I thought those were corn.  Well done. üåΩüåΩüåΩ

I laughed so damn hard.  
Make sure to check your bank statements and make sure they aren‚Äôt still billing you. It took me 3 months and getting the better business bureau and a lawyer involved to cancel my Steve Nash membership, and they still continued to bill me afterward. With SN they just said they would cancel it multiple time and then never did, I ‚Äúcanceled‚Äù via phone, in person, written through email, filled out paper cancellation forms, talked to a manager, ect ect, and it wasn‚Äôt until I did the above until it was actually really cancelled, and even then they were still billing me. There are horror stories about people getting billed for years and not noticing after canceling shady memberships.   
Charter Fitness does this too. I moved out of State. They had no locations in my new State of residence. I called them and asked to cancel my membership, they gave me the same load of BS as BabstheBeagle. I told them I have every right to cancel over the phone, and that if they won't I would be contacting my bank and canceling my credit card under suspicion of fraud. Charter-Fitness-Manger-Guy laughed it off and said, "fine, but we're not cancelling your membership without a notarized letter or you being here in person." That same day, I called my bank (who amazingly WAS able to verify who I was over the phone), told them the situation and they agreed to cancel my cc. Months later, Charter Fitness sent the money they felt I still owed them to a Collections Agency. I had to pay the collections agency $60 to get them to leave me alone and stop harassing me. They were calling me and leaving messages every day. Never doing business with Charter Fitness again. I highly recommend none of you do business with them either. TL;DR - Charter Fitness is super shady too.  
This is the most incredible thing I've read in a long time and your persistence is admirable.  
Admirable but necessary. Here's how you deal with these pricks, short and sweet. You put it all in writing, they have a stupid form they want you to fill out to cancel so they can draw this out indefinitely and bill you another cycle or two. So put it in writing, I am cancelling my membership effective 9/30/2018, yadda yadda, send it signature required to "Naomi" or wheoever at your branch. Then you can either report the card you used for them as lost (and you get a new number) or take your chances and see if they try to continue billing you contact Visa fraud department and you already have all your paperwork in order.  
Ok I reread the section three times before asking this. They said their call was important to you? That sounds completely bass ackwards  
Not to be weird, but we used to have a beagle named babs. Do I know you?   
Holy shit. I was once a general manager at an LA Fitness. This type of thing was not super unusual. Im so happy you got them to knuckle under. Reminds me of this marine who got charged for his membership over an entire deployment after calling and telling them to cancel. They only let him do it after he asked if they really wanted a pissed off marine at their front desk that day. You are right she could cancel the membership. She just wasnt allowed to. Neither was the GM(they are not actually general managers just sales managers) according to their shitty rules. Its damn astounding how they do it that way. Cutthroat, unnapproachable ownership what I was told.  
There was a story on Reddit about six months ago about I think LA Fitness.  Customer tried to cancel over the phone twice.  So they called the police as "he was stalking them" fortunately ha had been recording the second call to the gym and could play it back when the police called.  The police were also able to cancel his membership.  
Long ago in Spain they approved a law that stated, more or less: " You have to be able to cancel any contract in the same manner you got on it", meaning if you got the contract over the phone they have to cancel over the phone (the standard procedure for cancellations up to then was "send a fax, wait weeks, send another fax.. etc"). When I called to cancel my cell phone they started that "fax" crap on me, I told them not, "I do not have to, I signed the lined over the phone and you are going to cancel it over the phone", it took almost an hour and a couple phone calls, but it was one of the best laws that government passed in 8 years!!  
Don't want to hijack your AMA, but I want to pop in and just say, FUCK LA Fitness. I took them up on their offer for a free 1 on 1 with a personal trainer. I knew they were going to try and rope me into signing up for it, but what I didn't expect was how aggressive they would be about it. It was frankly disgusting. I went to see what sort of routine one expects with a personal trainer and wanted to see what it was like. At the end of the experience, I told them I needed to go home and think about it, and they went batshit insane. They did everything in their power to keep me from leaving. They spent over 2 hours trying to talk me into it ("Why do you need to think about it? What is there to think about?" over and over and over); the manager pretended to call a "higher up" to get me a "better deal", which he faked SO badly. He tried to tell me that my girlfriend might leave me if I don't get in slightly better shape, and when that didn't work, he started to argue that eventually I might die from health problems ("No doubt in my mind you're probably pre-diabetic", despite the fact that my doctor said otherwise and I'm not even that obese...) and he literally, I shit you not, began to say, repeatedly, "I'm trying to save your life" and started to conjure up scenarios in which I was dead and how it would make my family feel. (edit: For the sake of clarity, the dude saying that was the manager on duty trying to sell me on the trainer's service, not the personal trainer himself. The personal trainer was, at worst, complicit with his boss's shady tactics, and while also a douche, was not overtly offensive like he was.)  That's when I was like holy FUCK I have to get out of here now. As soon as he walked away to help another customer for a moment I fucking bolted out of the gym.  When I came back two weeks later to cancel my membership - on the final day that I could before the next month started - they refused to cancel it. It was, of course, the same fucker as before; He told me they couldn't cancel it after 5 PM because no one there had permissions to do so. This is probably the first and only time that I lost my fucking shit. I went off on the dude, how he is full of total shit, how this is a fucking scam, etc. And this fucker decides to get mouthy right back at me. On the fucking job. He starts cussing back at me, dropping F-bombs, and at one point, he grabbed a box of donuts and sarcastically was like "You want one? You look like you could use it." So yeah. Didn't get to cancel until the next day at which point they charged me for the next month anyway, but the GM there who listened to my tirade was actually pretty nice and apologetic, said it was impossible to refund though. She said she would investigate the problems I went through and would take action. But yeah. Fuck LA Fitness. I hope these shady fucks go out of business. TL;DR - LA Fitness is skeevy as fuck and tried to shame me into signing up for their personal trainer and then made fun of me when I tried to cancel my membership.  
I've called my bank before and told them this charge was unauthorized and to not all any future charges from this company. You could have probably gotten your money back that way. Screw LA fitness. I had to do this when they "wouldn't cancel my membership" for whatever BS reason like much of this post. I called my bank. Things fixed. Then LA called me every day as much as 22 times. Finally, they gave up.   
Yeah in my situation the GM was the only one who was reasonable! He must have realized how persistent I would be.   
LA Fitness's cancelation policies were worse. They were sued and the whole form by mail or in person cancelation by an Operations Manager is what they are legally allowed to get away with. I was able to get corporate to cancel mine by telling them I had mailed the form in twice and the Operations Manager had taken the form in person.  
Do you think they actually cancelled it tho, or will you be charged next month and have to repeat the cycle. I've heard these guys just says 'yep, its done' and it's not done. ‚Äã Best of luck - hope they actually did it!  
Something similar happened to me with another gym. I went through the ordeal of canceling 2 times before they actually did it. Good luck, I hope it really worked!   
I got an email confirmation that they did.  
Hope it worked. They might still try to charge you. If they do you may be able to take them to court.  
[deleted]  
Oh I got them to stop when I lived in Boston and told them I didn't own a car.  
"have you tried our mobile app!?"  
I was so inspired by your story I called and cancelled Frontier Internet because they wouldn‚Äôt renew the introductory $19.99 rate. Operator John from Connecticut couldn‚Äôt of cared less. Golf clap to you.   
The only question I have is.. what is it like to be a God?  
So satisfying, never have I won so hard before.   
Buy a lottery ticket and win big fam because your on a roll  
I wanna quit the gym!  
I actually just started going to a personal trainer instead! Its so much worse!!!  
What's the highest level "perk" they offered to keep you a member?  
They didn't offer me anything to stay. They just tried to just get me off the phone.   
Annnnd you'll get charged next month due to this miscommunication among everyone.  
Then I will just get to make another 26 calls!  
You're an inspiration to us all!  
How did you survive the entire ordeal? Also, why did it take so long and so tiresome to cancel a membership?  
I survived by laughing about it. And it ruins their profits.  
[deleted]  
Is it easier to cancel in person ? I heard the trainer contracts are even worse. Also, could you just have your bank block them ?  
I pay for other peoples memberships and it might be? Idk, I dont have time to take off of work for this.  
No questions. I wanted to give virtual high fives! So impressed! I just cancelled two subscriptions to online clothing stores where you get charged every month unless you skip. They don't want you to cancel and hope that you forget skipping too. All this time, I skipped every month because I did not want to deal with customer service and was constantly worried that I would forget.   
You must not have been around during aol dial up internet. Why was it so hard to cancel?  
I was around during dial up internet!  And LA Fitness only allows you to cancel in person 9AM to 5PM M-F or through mail. Gym memberships are known to be impossible to cancel because they don't want to lose the sale.   
I would of just showed up to cancel. Canceling aol internet was phone only, and it used to take us a few hours to cancel.  
So I work an hour away from the gym. I would have had to take time off of work to show up. And I remember those days, luckily that is no longer the case.   
I want to play!!  What is their number?  
Oooooh I do not think it would be so nice to post their number on the internet. Just call your local one and piss them off!  
You seriously care about them after the hell they put you through?  
Honestly I live by the mindset that everybody is going through something, why not try not to make it worse.  
fuck this gym. fuck it all.   
Very impressed. I just mailed my letter via certified mail to my gym AND their billing company, just in case, with 90 days notice so they can't bullshit me. Wish me luck!  
Would you be interested in going into business with me? I have a fantastic idea for a business and we can make one million dollars.  I have a ton of cds that I‚Äôve acquired over the years, I‚Äôm talking a shitload of compact discs. I live in a 2 bedroom house and the second bedroom is nothing but cds and clothes.  Anyway here is how we can make one million dollars. We call people, this where you come in, and get them to sign up with us. They can choose 10 cds for a penny so long as they buy 10 more at regular price within X amount of time.  After they receive their initial 10 cds we will jack up the price on their 10 ‚Äúregular‚Äù priced cds.  If they don‚Äôt mail in the card saying they don‚Äôt want the ‚Äúcd of the month‚Äù we send it to them at full price.  With my thousands of cds and your wizardry on the phones we can make one million dollars.  What do you think?  
When they charge you for next month will you make another ama?  
Is it so hard to cancel ? Cancle all debit and credit cards and send them a cancellation letter, If its direct debit cancle that too. Or can they just keep on taking money from you ?  
I cancelled mine by printing out a form, signing it, and mailing it to them. So... I dunno what's going on here.  
Took me two extra months and many calls to get $ back that was charged automatically at Anytime Fitness.  What's shadier than these large gyms are the charge processing companies they use.  I was interested in Gold's Gym and sat down with the guy.  He kept pressing for a direct bank account and not my debit card.  Turns out they get an incentive on that.  Walked out and drove off.  
If you were this committed to going to the gym you‚Äôd be the world‚Äôs strongest man!   
are You captain America now ?  
Funny thing I actually want to enroll in an LA Fitness near me, what is the best way of doing that without getting involved directly with LA Fitness and just being able to cancel whenever I want.  
LA Fitness can cancel your membership in person at the front desk.  My g/f just canceled in person because her employer's health insurance plan offers a fitness program where she can use several commercial gyms for one monthly fee which happens to be cheaper than LA's membership fee.  She told them she was going to just sign back up again but under her health insurance fitness program and they happily canceled.  Several of her coworkers were having trouble canceling as well, but when you tell them you are just going to sign back up again using the fitness program seems they have no issues canceling you on the spot.  My guess is they view it as a new enrollment opportunity for sales goals/tracking.    
After reading many comments and other stories, I think i have discovered, unknowingly, the way to do this. I lost my credit card last year on the beach.  I ordered a new one from PNC and it would take a few days to get to me.  Of course, the old one was cancelled to avoid theft.  About a day or two later I got a call from LA Fitness telling me they could not process payment.  I was actually very wary of them and made them verify all my information before i gave them the new credit card number. SO, do we think its possible just to cancel the credit card and get a new one?  Once they call, tell them youve tried to cancel multiple times, they arent helping with that, so the card you were being charged on is no longer valid.  
I once called a car dealership 322 times over the course of 90 days until they threatened to call the police on me for harassment.   Long story, they didn't make good on promises IN WRITING citing that the sales person that made those promises had no authorization to do so.  When i asked why the manager signed off, i was told (and i shit you not) "the managers don't review each and every letter written on a "we owe you" form".   In the end, i got what was coming to me, but it took a lot of effort to do so.  I'm also the guy that never ever ever goes away.  I will happily spend more time cost than value if i feel like i'm being screwed.  I applaud you, OP.  
What promise did they not initially deliver on?  
1 month of free gas, 1 month of free car washes, and 3 oil changes. The gas was to come in the form of a gift card. Gift card never came.   
They did this to me, just tell them that you already went in person to cancel and it was a location you don‚Äôt normally go to, so you don‚Äôt remember the managers name. Tell them you are still being charged and that they can check surveillance tapes to see when you were there. They also told me and my gf that we were on a month to month personal training account, come to find out we were on one year contract. We were never told it was a contract, so my gf called to cancel, but they literally made her jump through hoops and gave her the run around. They even sent her the contract and all the paperwork for the personal training. Joke was on them though, when I mentioned that while my girlfriend‚Äôs name was all over the paperwork, she didn‚Äôt sign the contract, I did. We are not married, so they promptly refunded our money. Such a sleazy gym for sure.  
Congratulations, but they'll probably still charge your account next month ... Sorry   
Why didn't you read the contract and cancel over mail like you're supposed to? I did, and it took me a whole 5 minutes.   Club memberships with recurring dues may be cancelled by printing a cancellation form online. Click on My LA Fitness. Login, click on Account Information tab and then click on the "Cancellation Form" option on the right side of the screen. Mail the form to the address listed on the form or you can provide written notice to us at PO Box 54170, Irvine, CA 92619-4170. We recommend you mail the notice by certified mail and keep a record for your files. Or, you can deliver the notice directly to the Operations Manager at the nearest LA Fitness facility between 9AM and 5PM on Monday through Friday (the days and times for in-club cancellations are subject to change depending upon the availability of Operations Manager). If you deliver the notice in person, please be sure to get a receipt for your records. A cancellation postmarked at least 5 business days before your next billing date should result in no further recurring billing. If less than 5 business days, you may be billed one more time. If this occurs, LA Fitness will refund that additional billing. If you are still within the initial term of your contract, your cancellation will be effective when your term is over. If you do decide to cancel your membership, you can still use the club for the additional time covered by the pre-paid last month‚Äôs dues we collected at enrollment. Your last month prepaid dues will be applied to the month AFTER the month paid by your final recurring billing, and your membership will expire at the end of that prepaid last month. If your Personal Training membership is still within its initial term or if you have a Paid In Full membership, please contact your local club for assistance.   
That's really awesome. congrats, It's hard to do. Gonna give a shameless plug to my friend who setup a new business to do this very thing, cancelmygym.com which cancels la fitness and new york sports clubs.   
Someone should crosspost a link to this at  /r/liars  
I feel like this is the kind of thing any corporate ding-dong wouldn't want to ever have to see on a massively popular website like Reddit. Like, after reading this, who in their right mind would ever sign up with LA Fitness?  
Can't you press legal charges if they don't cancel your membership?  
Happy birthday! Turn on social media notifications and message your family. Tell them it's your birthday and you wanted to talk to them. Unless they're deadset arseholes in which case, just get by on social media and the new friends you'll make in your new area. Have you met any new friends yet?  
Thank you, I didn‚Äôt turn off the notifications, but the reminder Facebook does where it tells everyone it‚Äôs your birthday. I would have hoped my family remembered my birthday.  
LoL you know. I made the same think and almost no one send me a greeting. Then I changed my birthday to another day 02/29 . And when my Facebook contacts saw. Some really good friends but clueless about my real birthday date post about that notification was wrong. And that's what I was expecting.  Someone who can remember in a odd way. Anyway long story short. Happy birthday. From Campeche, Mexico.  
Hey, don't worry, at least you haven't been on that boat for years now.  
Its ok man people forget sometimes  
This is why you should stop using facebook.. I got so taken aback when nobody even DMed me for my birthday.. like they did get that notification.. but that makes us realise that, that's how much they think of us.. so don't waste your time on thinking about them.. move on..  
I go around and tell everyone it's my birthday. I know I'm forgetful as f. I'm not gonna get mad that someone pulled a me and I enjoy the attention of telling people.  But if you're a primary person in my life and after I told you that many times that it's my birthday and you don't get me a card, a flashlight or give me wishes, I might be a teeny bit miffed.  
How do you like Austin? I visited it once and LOVED it there.  
I stay in the downtown area. I‚Äôm still not used to how quiet and small it is, but it is comforting.  I just really like that everyone here is friendly.  
If you can afford a downtown apartment at 22, then you are doing pretty well...probably.  
I live near Austin! What company brought you here?  
This is surprising to me. I‚Äôve never been to Texas, but I thought Austin was a big city? In my experience the downtowns of big cities are very loud and large, does Austin have a reverse situation?  
There's a lot of people in Austin but aside from downtown, it's more like a vast, sprawling suburb.  If you ever get a chance to go there, and I know this sounds lame, but do a segway tour of downtown. It's a lot of fun and you get to see a ton of the city, which is really funky and eclectic.  
It's big in the sense that there are tall buildings but nothing compared to NYC, or Chicago. Another thing, in texas we often build outwards rather than up, so it ends up feeling a lot smaller! Loads of people though.  
The only good thing about alone is that you get to choose who you want to be around. I went through this a few years back was homeless and had no family willing to help. I genuinely hope your birthday gets better. Happy birthday!  
Thank you, I hope things are a lot better for you too!  
[deleted]  
Thank you! I‚Äôm happy I atleast got one happy birthday üòä  
And another - happy birthday! Hope you have a much better year ahead of you.  
And another

Happy Birthday, internet stranger ‚ô° Did you do anything to treat yourself?  
Happy Birthday! I hope your day turned around!  
HAPPY BIRTHDAY BEAUTIFUL had a similar experience growing up  My parents have a vacation property so I spent a lot of time home alone in the summer- they were home before my birthday and talked about going up while it was my birthday  It would have been my moment to say ‚Äúits my 17th birthday saturday‚Äù  Instead I didn‚Äôt say anything to see if they truly forgot. Had a sweet house party and ended up flooding the place - they asked why I did that  Me: it was my birthday  Them: silence oh yes of course!  Years later they‚Äôve done a wonderful job of forgetting the forgetting -_-  Parents: what did we do for your 17th? Me: I had a party :)  Them: silence oh yes of course!  We have our 16 candles moment and its makes our future biopics way more relatable anyways  if I could change anything I would want them admitting they forgot even just to validate it always feels a little empty that I didn‚Äôt get the ‚Äúsorry I forgot‚Äù moment  And you could be passive aggressive and say ‚Äúits okay hundreds of strangers ended up wishing me happy birthday anyways‚Äù  thats what my unhealthy butt would say   
I hope that you call your family anyway, and that you have a Happy Birthday. Maybe challenge yourself to do something that you've never done before for your birthday. What is something a little crazy that you've always kind of wanted to do, but haven't?  
I definitely would love to try scuba diving, my only fear is getting stranded :)  
As someone who recently got their scuba license, DO IT. I was always curious but kind of terrified. My god it's a feeling that's out of this world. You feel like you're on another planet, weightless and silence all around you. It is honestly one of the most peaceful experiences you can have. Turns out I also had nothing to be afraid of, it was just beautiful. If you really want to try it out I highly recommend it.  
It really is like being on another planet, in another world. It‚Äôs unreal.  
[deleted]  
Same here! Once I tried it out for the first time, I was hooked. I only got my open water diver license but hoping to get more certifications in the future!!  
Happy birthday. What are you most exited for in the coming year?  
Definitely the politics! I love that election time brings out the best (and worse) in our democratic Republic!  
Cool.  
What was your favourite subject in hs?  
I‚Äôd say math, I was already great at it. I loved math because it allowed me to understand how things work.  
So what made you want to move to Austin? Job?  
Yes, I was looking for a CS job in Chicago, and I was offered one in Austin for 70k/y entry level. I had to move but after months of job searching I was just happy to get an offer.  
70k starting for a customer service job that‚Äôs insane. Unless I‚Äôm just retarded and don‚Äôt k ow what cs means. Is it going to be a temporary job?  
Favourite season? And why?  
I would say spring. Spring has the perfect weather for running!  
Spring in Austin and the surrounding area is awesome. If you can get out west a little I highly recommend it during the next couple months. Or at least down near McKinney Falls SP. And (late) happy birthday!  
Cool! I presume you like to go for a run, do you like also other sports?  
I am Groot!  
Thank you üòä  
I am Groot.

We are Groot  
HAPPY BIG 22ND BIRTHDAY MY DUDE!!!  
Thank you soo much! üòä  
You're very welcome my dude!!! üòä I hope you have a good rest of your birthday even if nobody didn't send you wishes.  
Happy birthday boss  
Thank you!  
Happy Birthday!!!!!!  
You have to tell yourself that this doesn't mean people don't love you and don't care about you.  My dad is TERRIBLE with dates. I know it's much worse when nobody remembers.  But to be quite honest with you, if I don't add people's birthdays to my calendar under their contacts, I'll forget about 90% of them.  So the reason you didn't get calls and texts is because your family didn't realize it's your birthday and quite frankly forgot what day it is. It'll hit them randomly soon and you'll get apologies.  
Yep I was about to say this OP, I rely so much on my fb reminders that it‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt care about someone who turns off their reminders, I‚Äôm just forgetful.  That also includes my sister, who is 18. She‚Äôs the youngest and I spoil her so much, I buy her things from makeup to pads to giving her advice from friends to boys to having to pick her up from the police station when she didn‚Äôt want to tell parents that she got in trouble. I take her to school, I tutor her, I pay for everything I‚Äôm always telling her she‚Äôs my expensive part time job. But I forget her birthday every year.  I think maybe your loneliness is making you feel this is an indicator of love when it‚Äôs not.  You will make friends, find hobbies you love and do them so it‚Äôs more natural when you form new bonds. I believe in you  
Agreed. I highly doubt their family was like "oh it's so and so's birthday, can't be fucked messaging though". They forgot it's your birthday, and to be honest if i turned my reminders off I would expect the same from most people except maybe my grandma who has it on her old-school hard copy calander. And if most people in my life turned off theirs I'd probably forget theirs too. But then again birthdays just arent a big deal for me so maybe everyone's different, but imo don't go turning off your reminders if you want people to remember your birthday, that's what they're for.  
This is me!!! I put a lot of effort into gifts/cards/surprises well in advance, for people I love so much and who mean everything to me, and then suddenly it‚Äôs a day or two after and I‚Äôll be like ‚ÄúNOOOOOOOOOOOO!‚Äù I absolutely need to keep dates in a calendar.  
[deleted]  
Yeah, I honestly don't care about my Bday. Just another day. And I'm the same with others, unless it's someone super close to me, I suck at remembering dates. That's why I send presents for no reason presents.What's not cooler than getting a present just because? Screw holidays.  
Happy birthday , we love you  
Thank you so much!  
Happy Birthday üéâüéà Hopefully your new job and the move was a good decision. Im sorry you had a lonely birthday. It's whatever!! Technology enables us to become dependent on it rather than connecting with humanity the way it once was. As long as you don't forget their birthdays, you're good.  
Thanks however it looks like the job move wasn‚Äôt worth it. I got laid off with the whole pandemic situation and the company couldn‚Äôt afford to lose 2 weeks of business. On the brightside side they gave us a 2 month salary bonus to ‚Äúsurvive‚ÄùüòÇ  
This plandemic craziness is too much already! A 2 month salary bonus sounds sweet!! Hang in there...  
It really is, however it‚Äôs like the next two months are on me to find another job and relax. Hopefully it won‚Äôt take longer now That I have expirence  
You can do it üí™ This too shall pass...  
Man, I live in Austin. If I weren‚Äôt in bed already (3kids) I‚Äôd say let‚Äôs go get drinks. Happy birthday. Go to Rain on 4th st. Tell even one person there it‚Äôs your birthday and next thing you know you‚Äôll have 37 friends kicking it with you. ‚ù§Ô∏è  
Same. I‚Äôm 29 going on 70.  Avoid 6th street. It‚Äôs so loud that it‚Äôs impossible to connect with people.

Keep Austin Weird  
I live in Austin and it‚Äôs great.  
I too turned off social media reminders and none of my friends knew about my birthday. When they asked me later about the date and understood it had already passed, they were very "angry" (in a kind way) at me. My best friend said : "You can't just be silent and not let us be there for you. We love you but we can't show it or be part of your life if you don't open up. It's important for us too, we really want this. Promise me you'll remind us next year". We were both pretty drunk at this point but I nearly cried. I think social media are kind of a trap those days but it's not a reason to keep all of your friends out of important events. If you don't want the fake one, don't use it, but just tell the important people around you, or even just people you want to get to know better, that today's your birthday and you'd want them to be a part of it and do something together ! You can even do it late, next week-end. Enjoy !  
Happy 22nd birthday! I'm sorry you're lonely. Sending friendly and comforting hugs!  
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!  What was your favorite memory of your 21st year?!  Mine was when I studied abroad in Italy - the whole semester, really, but specifically when I had my end-of-the-semester oil painting class showcase. My grandma had passed away while I was abroad, so I decided to paint three portraits of her as a child, grandmother and spirit. I did it as therapy for myself and as an ode to her life. My Italian host mother and American mother were both there the night of the student showcase, and they met and embraced one another before my trip of paintings. They both knew my grandmother in that moment as a uniting, strong individual that was so special to me and my life. We all cried for her, together. It was remarkably emotional and beautiful.  I hope you have a wonderful 22nd year, you are so loved!  
Happy birthday twin it's my birthday also!  
My bday as well! Happy Birthday to you both!  
You too  
One of the few times when replying to "happy birthday" with "you too" makes sense lol.  
Haha yeah  
Happy Birthday to you too then!  
Why did you turn off your reminder? Maybe 10 or 20 years ago people remembered everyone‚Äôs birthdays by marking it on a calendar, but for me, outside of my GF and one of my brothers whose birthday is exactly a month before mine, I don‚Äôt remember anyones. Personally, I don‚Äôt care at all for birthdays and could care less, but if you wanted people to notice why block the most common avenue that people use to remember?  
Grab a case of beer, head to franklins in the morning and make some friends in line. Then buy $50 worth of smoked meat and enjoy your birthday weekend.  
I'm in Austin, shoot me a DM and let's figure out a good way to celebrate!  
Happy Birthday from Chicago!!! So sorry your family didn't call, but your Chicago family is here!!! üéÇüéâüçªüéàüíêüéäüíú  
In hindsight, would you have felt better if you left the social reminders on and subsequently received genuine birthday messages from people who otherwise  legit forgot/didn't know it's your birthday?  
Aint no thing buddy. My family loves me and ive had more than one birthday pass by without notice. Itll become the norm as you age unless you have your birthday tattooed on your forehead or something.  
Happy Birthday https://youtu.be/UOzgpn7qv5g  
Thanks for the minions! I wasn‚Äôt expecting that üòä  
First off, Happy Birthday!! The dark silver lining FWIW if you're American, 22 is legit the most meaningless birthday age of all birthday ages. 1-6 you don't remember 7,8,9 you're cute and young enough to not be expected to work for it but old enough to understand advertising, ask for shit, and your disappoinment if you don't get it is enough for your parents to get it.  10 is double digits  11,12 still too young to work, but also young enough to make it a spectacle and get a party. 13 you're a teenager  14,15 you're still in high school so you have enough of a friend base to make it a celebration and have people show up because parents will make them so they don't look mean. Still in presents territory. 16, 17, permit, license.....16 is a spectacle if you're a girl.  18 "legal" 19,20 are pretty lame you're still going to a bowling alley or some shit but you're probably sneaking weed or alcohol so fucking yolo 21: duh 22 is when you realize nobody gives a shit and your friend group dwindles due to college, work, etc...even if you do something it's likely your least lucrative and flashy bday ever. 23 and 24 suck but you're used to it from 22 25 is halfway through your 20s  26-28 are meaningless but you likely (hopefully) have bills and a full time job so if nothing else it's a day to take off work (I work in the restaurant industry so as long as you're not born on Valentine's day, new years, Thanksgiving Eve, mother's day or Father's day, you can just ask to be off) 29 last birthday of your 20s 30- a new decade The rest are just kinda sad if you're single until the 5's and 0's. Even if you're taken, a shitty girlfriend or boyfriend can and will fuck your birthday up, and since they have first dibs on being the first invite, who you can and can't invite, and sometimes the one planning it, its super boom or bust. I dated the same person ages 26-30 and she made 2 really wonderful but legit made 2 the worst of my life, and I don't remember the others.  Anyways, shake it off. As you age you'll appreciate a day off and alone time more and more.   A good idea which I did was pick a quirky but unassuming venue that doesn't require a ton of money, any certain activity, no dress code and closes late. If you have one super fun one, next year invite everyone to the same spot and they'll likely remember the previous year and show up. Like, bad = bowling, Dave and Buster's, fancy dinner, painting parties, etc I found a bar by me that closes at 2, cheap, and has a huge outdoor area with tvs and music, tons of patio tables, a canopy to protect from the elements, 6 beer pong tables, and a window you walk up to and ring a bell and they bring your drinks right to you.  Nowadays, I'm 34 and haven't celebrated my birthday since my 30th but I have a fucking awesome dog I couldn't live without. His birthday I take off work, as well as the day after, have it catered (well....delivered and I set it up in my one bedroom apartment) tell everyone you are forbidden to bring any alcohol or food as I will provide it all on my own dime, but you're not allowed in without something for my dog. He was the runt and got bullied, peed on, and wasn't allowed a nipple (litter of 8, mom had 7 working) and seeing his huge stupid smile all night , running around, everyone petting him And giving him treats toys and bones and singing Happy Birthday and seeing him passed out, tongue out, breathing heavy in a room littered with toys.....man, that's better than anything. I guess I'm rambling because I'm pretty lonely too. I've just learned to accept it and actually prefer it. Anyhow, if you're ever down in the dumps you can PM me. I'm up super late every single night and love to bullshit. I'm super well liked and popular at work and get invited out all the time but I'm not allowed because I'm a manager, and since friends my age nearly all have kids or awful girlfriends , and my schedule is sideways, I don't really get the luxury of being social outside of work, or the occasional bartender I like to talk to. Anyways, again, happy birthday! Oh, and if all else fails, if you still use social media, just randomly change your birthday to the current date once in awhile. Sad but effective sobs  
Hey dude, please dont take it too hard. I can tell you my sisters birthday (including year) in a heartbeat and vice versa, and we're extremely close (traveling together, a million inside jokes, and can spend days on end togethwr) but this year BOTH of us forgot each others birthdays and were only reminded bc we literally live together and had to tell each other. I know it sucks, but please dont think this means your friends or family don't care about you.  And happy birthday ofc :)

Hey happy birthday your existence made the world a better place and we wish you a long live.. ‚ô•Ô∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è  
It's my birthday today too.  We're birthday siblings.  I'm 11 years older than you so you must have been a happy surprise!  If you ever feel lonely, hmu here and I'll give you some advise (good it bad) or a good ear to talk to.  Cheer up and happy birthday, because you just gained some more family.  
Happy (belated) Birthday OP!! üéÇüéàüéÅüßÅ  Just try to remember that you are still loved and cherished by your family. I know that moving to a new city can make you feel alone, especially when something like this happens. Don‚Äôt let this discourage you. On a different note, what do you do for work?  
Happy birthday! It was just mine too on the 6th. Also 22! I hope you feel less lonely now, the world is full of really good energy and I can only hope it's in the cards for you to experience soon. How are you today?  
What‚Äôs your number  
Dude.  You are TWENTY TWO.  You are responsible for your own happiness.  If you want people to be excited that it's your birthday, TELL THEM IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.  It's really that simple.  
Hey friend, don‚Äôt do this to yourself. While we wish our loved ones didn‚Äôt need an internet reminder to remind them of a birthday unfortunately it‚Äôs the way the world operates now. For the past ‚Äúx‚Äù number of years social media has reminded them to call you on this day. It‚Äôs basically trained them. You changed a common trigger and are surprised and upset it worked.... you‚Äôre helping to make your own fears come true. As a world we need to be kinder to ourselves and others. If you knew them not calling would hurt you take steps to protect yourself from that pain, not increase the chances of it coming true. Call them 2-3 days before and talk about your day so it‚Äôs in their minds. Leave those reminders on. If it‚Äôs getting late on the day itself call them to ‚Äòjust chat‚Äô so they‚Äôll remember. This is for you looking out for you. It‚Äôs maturity to admit you want it for your mental health and take action to make it happen. It‚Äôs immaturity to go out of your way to potentially make a bad situation worse. Most importantly, Happy Birthday! I hope reddit can help fix that loneliness you‚Äôre feeling.  For the question, as someone else born this month, what do you like about having your birthday this time of year?  
hey man, just wanted to say happy birthday and send some love your way. i've been there before -- although i live .5 miles from my mom and siblings, so im not sure if that makes it better or worse, lol -- and i know it sucks, so im not going to try to sugar coat that aspect of it. but what i will do is tell you that you rock, and somebody cares about your happiness, even if its just some weird random internet stranger.  hopefully you got out and were able to do something for yourself today, or will in the days to come! and if not, let me know; i cant offer much, but off the top of my head i know i have a few free movie credits for Cinemark theaters. if you have one in your area (a quick search shows Southpark Meadows being 2 miles from Austin, but im not sure if thats convenient for you or not), let me know and i'll send you 2 tickets for you and a friend to grab a movie of your choice (or 2 movies if you prefer to go alone!) standing offer, so feel free to PM me and i'll find a way to get them to you (they're digital, so it shouldnt be too difficult to figure something out)... edit: deets.  
H A P P Y  B I R T H D A Y ! üôÇüéâüéà Despite it all, you're a year stronger, wiser! Pat yourself in the back and do you! I hope you have a great day!  
Get used to it. Family is just a word that means nothing. You can choose who you love and call family. I spent every major holiday alone this year after my fianc√© left me. My family and I don‚Äôt speak, and my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù are surface level and without substance. There are several people I care about, but even they aren‚Äôt that close to me these days. If I can give you any advice considering I‚Äôve done this all ass-backwards because of my distorted reality... go make authentic relationships with new people. Not these one-sided relationships that leave you empty and alone... Wondering what‚Äôs wrong with you? There is nothing wrong with you! People out there will be able love you more than anyone you‚Äôve ever known. Just don‚Äôt give all of yourself away too freely, and stop expecting others to care about you the way you need. Assuming that family and friends have the emotional capacity to tend to your basic needs is simply unrealistic. Good luck out there.  
Happy late birthday first of all! Hey, I can completely relate haha. I haven't gotten a single gift in years and birthday wishes are scant too (I think even my parents forgot last year). It's probably worse than I'm a girl in a high school with a bunch of social media-obsessed robots (girls love posting long montages and stories for birthdays). My family never really celebrated birthdays, I'm shit with dates so I forget all my friend's, and I rarely go on social media and turn off social media alerts.  Honestly, it's a little depressing at first but I've come to terms with it. You'll always be alone in life, sooner or later you gotta accept that. And 95% of happy birthdays others get are generic, basic, and fake anyways, it's just external validation. You gotta love yourself and just know that even if people don't remember your birthday, they still love you/care about you.  
Happy Belated Birthday! üéÇüéÅüéâü•≥ Family can be weird, just know it‚Äôs not about you. Hope you had a wonderful day!  
Social media is fake birthday posts? and your complaining about no one saying happy birthday? Come on man.  
Happy birthday, friend! I've had similar experiences. Being in a new city is really tough. I've spent the last 2 years in a brand new city with 0 people i knew, but soon you'll make new friends and build relationships. It was super lonely and depressing at first but it will get better. When that time comes you'll be able to look back and acknowledge what you were able to get through on your own and have a new appreciation for all the new people who do care and think about you who've come into your life since the start of this new journey. So, happy birthday and I wish you a wonderful weekend and another successful year just ahead.  P.s. try to go out and treat yourself to something nice this weekend. Splurge a little bit on #1 in your life... You!  
This exact situation happened to me too. I wasn‚Äôt using social media much so I turned off bday reminders. And then, the only greeting I got was an automated email from my dentist. Super lame! I would never have expected to take it so hard but it got me down in the dumps for daysssss. I‚Äôm so sorry. It‚Äôs one of those things you will move past, and realize it‚Äôs not the worst thing (and doesn‚Äôt mean what you think it means! People do care about you! They‚Äôre just lazy/crap at remembering!). You will also have birthdays ahead of you where people in your life‚Äînew or old‚Äîwill put in lots of effort to make you feel great. I‚Äôm sorry it was a bummer. I hope you did something nice for yourself to celebrate YOU. If not, you definitely should. You‚Äôre worth it!  
Happy birthday!!  I'm so sorry no one texted you.  That's so disappointing.   But there ARE people here who care about you and are so glad to know it's your birthday!   You're the same age as my son, in fact (off by just about 2 months).  22 is tough, no matter how you slice it (cake pun intended).  No one knows if they should treat you as an adult yet, but you're expected to do a lot of adult stuff, like, uh, pay your bills, rent , buy food, etc.  And yeah, everyone wants to be remembered on their birthday -- that never goes away. So from one of your thousands of internet moms, let me say again HAPPY BIRTHDAY!  I'm really proud of you (a job in Austin?? Wow!) and hope you have a fantastic year.  
Keep in mind that, although it is understandable you feel lonely, knowing that if you had your date of birth on FB/Social media you would get tons of attention- I don't have a FB anymore and nobody wishes me a happy bday besides some family.  I remember the first year I was off FB, I felt bummed and realized I had this bizarre relationship to 200 ppl I didn't really know well wishing me a happy day, it's nice but also know that social media platforms have this contradicting affect on our expectations in terms of attention.  Happy birthday, use it as a day of reflection and go walk around Austin.  If you like music - Elephant Room downtown is rad, live jazz and amazing atmosphere.  Cheers!  
Atleast you turned off facebook reminders and arent getting fake happy birthday wishes from complete strangers out of pity. Atleast you have that.  
What the hell is a fake happy birthday? Who gives a fuck if someone doesn‚Äôt remember a date, that‚Äôs literally what reminders are for. People set alarms to wake up at the same time everyday... he played himself and is being a whine-ass about it.  
Happy Birthday Bro!! I'm a little late but i hope you had a great time! Cheers From Holland!  
You should call them and let them know that you are upset about this and explain to them why.  
Hey I‚Äôm 22 too! I‚Äôm sorry that you‚Äôre going through this. And I hope your family just slept in really really late or their phones broke or something instead of them forgetting. But honestly if somehow weirdly my phone broke I‚Äôd do anything to make sure you got the message lol!!  I hope you have a good birthday and you should totally go out to eat or order in from like 5 different places and get desert too. I also love those eat in theaters!! That would be good!!  I hope your next birthday is better and your family either repaired things and apologized to you or you found new people to call family that won‚Äôt forget your birthday!! Love you :)  
Happy birthday! Sorry you had a lonely one. =( Turning off the social media notifications is an understandable move, but it probably had a lot to do with it. One would like to think people can just remember your birthday and you get genuine responses, but it doesn't really work that way anymore.  In the same way that remembering phone numbers has been exported to our phones, remember birthdays has been exported to social media. This doesn't mean that people don't care at all. It just means that information is not stored in our brains anymore. I'm guilty of it too. Try not to hate people too much for it. It's just how our brains work.  
I hope you have a happy birthday regardless from us Internet people, really, take comfort in the kindness of strangers. My birthday is in 5 days and I'm facing the death oh my most beloved grandparent and most of my friends a snubbed me when I tried to organise something, but people who I don't consider friends have been consoling me and it really does show that people want to make a difference is random peoples loves because they know how much of a positive impact it can have, so please have a drink on me and treat yourself. Where your family have failed you, your Internet family will ways be there.  
I don‚Äôt know your family, the dynamics, or you.   I‚Äôm not on the FB, so my family simply knows to share those reminders with me so that I don‚Äôt miss birthdays.  Why?  I don‚Äôt do so well with the calendar.  I‚Äôll buy a birthday present anytime I find one.  I‚Äôll think about my sibling‚Äôs bday for an entire week leading up to, and then finger to call on the actual day. I love my family so much, and they know it.  I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôll call anytime so that when I forget to call on a birthday, that‚Äôs not taken as a reflection of their value to me. Here‚Äôs hoping you are loved by them on other days of the year.  
Happy birthday  I‚Äôll meet you on 6th street in an hour and we party our ass off!  
Happy birthday dude, sorry to hear that you've went forgotten this year, I've done the exact same thing, turned off my social media notifications, I hated the fake birthday wishes from people I didn't even talk to in real life, now every year nearly everyone forgets my birthday, even family, but it doesn't bother me, and try not to leave it bother you, just save yourself money every year on birthday gifts for your family from now on. Hope you feel better and don't let this play on your mind. And in the spirit of the sub reddit, what's your favorite food?  
Happy birthday. Unfortunately this is part of growing up. I don't use Facebook so I don't get happy birthdays. If I do, it's never on the actual day of my birthday. There is nothing wrong with reaching out to family and friends on your special day. Not to remind them, but to include them in your life. As adults everyone has their own stuff going on. On the rare occasion that my siblings or parents do remember my birthday I feel grateful but it's not worth beating yourself up over it if they forget.  How do you plan to celebrate this weekend?  
Im in the same boat! Moved from SoCal to NorCal five years ago and my birthdays are always the hardest especially considering I always go all out for my loved ones. So what I started doing was going all out ON ME! I now get myself whatever my heart desires! This year, it‚Äôs a trip to Spain! I suggest you‚Äôd do the same, take yourself out! Whether it‚Äôs a small trip or shopping spree or whatever it is you enjoy, but do something for yourself! Sending you a big ole hug because I know the feeling!  Anyway, question what‚Äôs your spirit animal?  
Im not sure that profanity is allowed but fuck them man.  forge your own life if i was in your place id be with you. I currently have depression so i know how it feels. If they dont care about you the fuck em. Whats your number ill call you if i can.  you are an amazing person being away from your family is a tough choice. You have succesfully done that. God is with you. We are with you. The world is now connected even if you are far. Dm me your facebook or whatever account you have. Ill call you. Ill be with you.  
Happy birthday!!! Like you, I moved away from family and friends for school too, and it's totally normal to feel lonely. I've had people forget to wish my happy birthday as well, and I know how upsetting it can be. Point is, your best friend will always be yourself. I learned to appreciate myself and I realize that the only person I can truly rely on is myself. I'm not gonna sit and here and pretend that it's easy, but it definitely helps me feel better when I'm feeling lonely! Anyways, have a great day :)  
Celebrated my birthday alone in a hotel room this year. It's cool man  
Happy Birthday I hope you have a better second day of being 22. When I was in my 20s, I once tried to organise a meal out with friends for my birthday and nobody replied to my invitation. It was not a good birthday, but I made it my resolution for the next year to use one of my hobbies to make new friends. I‚Äôm now part of a sewing group that meets every month or so and I‚Äôve made some really great friends. Do you have a hobby you could use to make new friends so that next year is better?  
Those aren‚Äôt fake birthday posts. They really help people remember your birthday. I‚Äôm terrible with dates and it‚Äôs helpful to have that as a reminder. Every birthday post I‚Äôve gotten has been really genuine and have given people a chance to catch up. Don‚Äôt think too much into it.  I just had a birthday and live 3000 miles away from my family and friends. I‚Äôve since made new ones, but I know how hard it is in the beginning. Hang in there and don‚Äôt think too much into it.  
Hey buddy. When I first moved out I didn't have a livingroom, and my roommate smoked indoors, so I couldn't invite my family. After I asked them if I could celebrate my birthday at one of their places, no one replied. I know how you feel, man. I don't have facebook so I don't expect any messages from people. You'll come to realise that people who care about you might not care about remembering birthdays, or using their agenda for that type of stuff. Treat yourself :)  
Happy birthday! I know it sucks when they forget. I've had it happen to me too. No matter what kind of family you have, remember they're just human. Not an excuse, but I doubt it's deliberate from their side. Do you know someone where you live now? Call one or few out for a beer. Just say "hey, want to go for a beer? It's my birthday and I just didn't want to sit at home". Worst case, you'll just get a greeting. And no, it's not sad. You're far away from home.  
Happy bday keep your chin up! Push forward and get what's yours!  
That happened to me in feb. Except some of my family live in the same city as me or at most the next city over. Basically at most a 1 hr drive. Not a single person wished me happy birthday. But you know what? I've been happier since I learned to forget those who dont care and appreciate and love better the ones that are really there for you. Happy birthday sending positive vibes your way hopefully it makes your day luckier.  
Well, I‚Äôm very sorry no one remembered your bday.  When I turned 23 I was with a group, on a trip in Europe.  It was the first time I was away from family on a birthday.  Same thing you described.  No wishes of happy birthday.  It was definitely a drag.  30 years later, I still remind my immediate friends or family a few days in advance with - ‚Äúhey, don‚Äôt forget my bday‚Äù! So anyway.  Wishing you a very happy birthday. :-)  
Happy Birthday....and at some point on life, your own celebration of your birthday, not what others do, will be what is meaningful.  Past birthdays of mine that sucked: My dad passing away one year and on another birthday year getting a verbal warning, when my boss knew damm well it was my birthday. Then made sure I got a cake, lol. This year I rescued a stray kitty.  As you get older, it's what you make of it.

It‚Äôs probably not your birthday anymore for you but happy birthday!! :) I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre feeling lonely, I‚Äôve felt that too for sure. I hope you feel better soon! Birthdays suck for me as well. I still live with my family, but I still have no friends or anyone to celebrate with. I typically just gorge myself with cake and call it a night. The point is, you aren‚Äôt alone, even if it feels like you are right now.  
Happy birthday!  I‚Äôd say leave the notifications for people on!  I make it a part of my day to wish everyone that comes up a hapless birthday no matter how close or not we are.  I know I appreciate each and every person that wishes me a happy birthday, so I like to show some love that way. It can be hard to remember every single persons birthday - I honestly only remember my parents and siblings and that‚Äôs it!  
Hey, happy belated birthday, and just wanted to say good for you for reaching out when you‚Äôre in need. Takes stones to admit when you‚Äôre struggling, even emotionally.  Much love, and hope this is an incredible year that gets filled up by good people who will be for you on the next birthday. ‚ÄúWhat shall I do with the stranger? Welcome him into my home, and treat him as a brother, so he may become one. . .‚Äù  
Happened to me on my birthday, lost in touch with all my  college friends, due to some reason. Surprisingly enough my colleagues wished me, and then some very old school friends, i was feeling pretty awful on that particular night,  and friends not remembering my birthday just put a cherry on top. Then i told my old friends they called me and we talked for like an hour. So, it got better eventually.  
Not sure why this is an issue. I dont celebrate  birthdays unless is for someone 12 under or unless its a milestone.  Its just another day, just treat yourself to your faviurite things, appreciate gestures your shown but  its  childish to insist everyone drop what theyre doing because its your birthday. Youve had a lot of them in the past and theres more in the future...  
Happy birthday! I hope you‚Äôre enjoying your new job & that it made all the upheaval worth it. Moving is stressful at the best of times but the added worry of the job, new people, a whole new life- it must‚Äôve been tough. You‚Äôre very brave to have done that on your own, especially at only 21! Hope you have a great year & your next birthday is much more fun for you.  
I am officially estranged from my family, and this birthday, like all my others hurt very much. No call/text/etc.  I‚Äôve found that reddit is such a great place and I hope all these kind strangers brought happiness to your day, which is supposed to be all about you.  Treat yourself to something you love, and hope your day was fantastic!  You truly deserve it ‚ù§Ô∏è  
Felt very similar when I moved to Philadelphia from Minnesota. Right around that 4 to 6 months. Granted you kind of got screwed and I'm sorry you had to deal with that, happy birthday :). But push through. In a few months you'll either feel better or otherwise you can always go home! Don't be afraid to reach out to a stranger. You never know you who may meet!  
Happy birthday! ü•≥ So you've been able to drink and drive for a year, hopefully not at the same time. Okay, my jokes could be better, anyway what's your favorite sub? Take that as you please, a sandwich, a reddit, a train. Your birthday may be a day when people usually show that they remember you, but know that they're still there and you got us over here.  
birthdays are a propaganda devised by the government to have you spend more money on gifts. birthdays don‚Äôt mean anything. you are just a year older, a year closer to death. it‚Äôs like any other day. you don‚Äôt suddenly get smarter or fitter or earn more money on your birthday. we should erase the entire concept on birthdays. also happy birthday buddy  
Happy Birthday! I‚Äôm sure this won‚Äôt mean a lot from a stranger that doesn‚Äôt know you, but just wanted to say to be living on your own after relocating states away for (presumably) your first big job at just 22 is damn impressive! You should be proud! I hope your family comes around and is apologetic for forgetting your day.  
im sorry. i cant say i completely understand what you are going through but i do feel you till some extent. HAPPY BIRTHDAY !!!! 22 thats amazing, id say spend the day for yourself, order some pizza, wear your favorite jammies and get in bed to watch your favorite movie/show. thats what i do and it makes me feel better. :)  
Happy belated birthday. I hope the day after you woke up refreshed and had a nice boost from all these people here. It‚Äôs the first ‚Äúgrown-up‚Äù birthday. The ones where you realize that even if people don‚Äôt remember the date they still love you and you‚Äôre super valuable. It‚Äôs still really nice to be treated special though.  
Happy birthday all the way from Mauritius! Don't feel bad my mum forgets every year and I forget most people's own too if it's not on my calender. They love you and once it hits them expect to be flooded with lots of calls and offers to be made up to. Happy birthday once more have a fun filled and successful year.  
Happy Birthday from a cake day 4 year old..  
Aw I feel really bad for you. But remember you are loved by these people, birthdays are just forgotten sometimes, there's always something there like social media or the person who's birthday it is to remind people. I myself have forgotten my mums birthday and nans before and apologised later. it just happens.  
Happy birthday, OP! I've been on my own in New York for over five years, and I seldom get birthday wishes of my own. If not for the folks at my job, I'd be prone to forget my own birthday.  I suppose my only suggestion is to just celebrate yourself however you want. You deserve that much, to be honest.  
Even if this AmA is long gone by now, happy birthday to you! As stupid as it sounds - and as unlikely it is you will ever read this - don't care about people who doesn't care about you! I don't know you, but I wish you the very best and hope you are or will become the person you always wanted to be  
Happy birthday! Sorry to hear about the inconsiderate people in your life. I get it and have Been there a bunch. It‚Äôs okay though. This is how we get through life.  Treat yo self to some bbq and go to salt lick.  Also, maybe go on tinder or bumble and update your bio to say it‚Äôs your bday  
Happy birthday.... Much love from hereü•∞  
I know it's late but happy birthday (:  
Sup mutha fucka. Happy birthday! Shit mate fucking Austen, almost stopped through there was me upon a time, hear they got good music. Any punk or metal? Anyway, wishing you well, may your day be filled with pleasant food. Ice music and assorted forms of moderate hedonism. ‚úåÔ∏è  
A day late but happy b day... And....... how do you turn off your b day notifications? I‚Äôve always hated that because like you said the fake b day wishes and shit. I would always deactivate my account for my birthday month cause of that. This sounds like a better option lol  
Dude, Happy Birthday day. That‚Äôs pretty shit that you‚Äôre family didn‚Äôt call you on your birthday of all days! I hope you treated yourself on your birthday. Sometimes when no one is there to something for you then you gotta love yourself and treat yo self. all love brother.  
Trust me, if nobody calls me on my birthday, I am OK with it. I rather watching TV or something rather than celebrate my birthday. Anyways, happy birthday to you!  Btw, have you ever had a feud with your family or something? If so, this is why they didn‚Äôt call you.  
Happy Birthday !  I did the same thing no birthday notifications on Facebook and no phone calls for my birthday.  Don't really care that much as it just shows that people's memory is as good as their social media. Any way an awesome.day ! Best wishes from Germany.  
Happy birthday, man. I know how that feels, you're not alone. I'm sure your family loves you, it's just sometimes people forget even the most important days. Hope you're feeling better, I wish you all the best and hope your future is brighter than your present  
Happy late birthday! My question: what is your favorite thing? just anything, a food, drink, object, animal, word, planet, even. Just anything in existence in our strange extra-multiverse ( I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs called an extra-multiverse but let‚Äôs say it is)!  
I feel you, I live not far from relatives but I never get anything for my birthday. It‚Äôs hard to deal with the fact that people don‚Äôt care about you enough to get you a present or say happy birthday, so I‚Äôm gonna change that for you at least! Happy birthday <3  
Happy birthday!!! I know exactly how it feels to move away from family! I've lived away from my family for the last 10 years to include different countries.  I truly feel your pain.  It sucks, and it only gets better if you find friends to distract you  
Happy late birthday, that sucks :(  
HAPPY MOTHER FUCKING BIRTHDAY!!!!!  
Happy birthday. In my experience this is kind of normal as you get older. I‚Äôm not on Facebook or any social media that tracks your birthday. Other than my wife,  I haven‚Äôt been told happy birthday from anyone in my family in probably 20 years.  
The real issue is how to gently (impossible to let fly on this) remind your family that family matters a lot. Note we don't know any details, if there are reasons or who if anyone is to blame. I'll make a guess and say there are some issues.  
Happy birthday! May you achieve more success and happiness. And I'm sorry that it happened to you, I know exactly what you feel but don't fret I'm sure it's because of social media. Family will more likely remember it next time.  
Happy Birthday - I manage to send you a little present through the wonder of Reddit! Now - as it‚Äôs a AMA .....in the event of a death match, how many Oompa Loompas do you think you could take down before they overpower you?  
Why didn‚Äôt you do a /r/roastme post instead, for a little ‚Äúkick me when I‚Äôm already down‚Äù? But seriously, happy birthday.   Sometimes they‚Äôre good ones and sometimes they‚Äôre bad.   Hope people made this one better for you.  
Happy birthday mate! Why don‚Äôt you treat yourself go out and buy yourself something silly treat yourself, it is your day after all.  Hope you have a lovely weekend and if you‚Äôd ever like to chat you can message me anytime.  
I never post comments on Reddit but Happy birthday. My family is in the same state and neighboring state and I know how it feels. Hope you have a dogs day and your following day makes up for what could have happened today  
Happy birthday OP! I also turned 22 this year, and it was my first birthday after cutting off contact with most of my family. It sucks ass to be alone, but on the bright side you don't have to share your cake with anyone!  
Happy birthday my darling Xxxx  
Happy birthday!! I send you a hug from here! Omg I feel you, my father forgot my bday, congrated me a week after and he thought I was one year younger than what I actually am. So yeah, family can be terrible with dates.  
Hi friend. I‚Äôm in Austin, too! Just north actually. Pretty weird day for us Austinites, huh? Happy Birthday from across town, id clink glasses with ya if I could. Hang in there :) it gets better, being in a new place.  
Yeah I hate those fake birthdays too - but it is super hard to remember everyone‚Äôs bday which is why I started writing them into my phone‚Äôs calendar. Make sure you don‚Äôt forget your friends‚Äô/family members‚Äô birthdays.  
Happy Birthday!!! Best wishes!!!  I had the same feeling when I first disabled my social media birthday notifications... It got better and better afterwards. People started to put the date in their calendars I guess üòã  
Happy birthday boss, why are you that far? I'm in the same situation, I'm 458 miles away from my family. I moved away because of business opportunity, I'm in the process of owning my own dispensary. How old are you?  
That‚Äôs so terrible! My grandmother who lives really far away always calls to wish me and my brothers happy birthday! Now the question is, would you ever consider replacing this terrible family? Also happy birthday!  
Since you revealed that is your birthday to us today, isn't every single "happy bday wish" in here just as fake as the ones you'd have gotten from people who bothered texting you after a social media notification?  
Happy Birthday fellow Fishie!  
I feel you. My birthday last year was the loneliest. I had to literally post it to Facebook and Instagram and barely any replies... This year I'm not even gonna worry about it. I'm just going to watch trains.  
Creo que es egoc√©ntrico pensar que la gente recordar√° tu cumplea√±os.  Eres parte de su mundo, nada m√°s, as√≠ que no te sientas mal, habla al menos con tu familia y cu√©ntales qu√© pas√≥.  Quiz√°s solo lo olviden.

Happy birthday from your neighbor in SA! I've done a very similar transition from the upper Midwest to south central Texas, so let me truly welcome you to Texas! Many hugs and well wishes to you!  
Assuming this is true, are you now scared of vaccines that you actually need? Vaccines you get as an adult still (tetanus for example)? Also, can you please elaborate on the Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© Syndrome? Is it painful? Do you have bad nerve pain from it? How is it on a day to day basis, is it always bothering you or only during flare ups/relapses? Thanks! I hope the best for you and that it leaves you alone man/girl. Stay strong =)  
Given that I have an auto-immune disorder and could potentially be sensitive to all vaccines, I've been advised not to receive any more. So I haven't been vaccinated since I was 14. It's very possible that another adverse reaction could kill me and even doctors don't think that it's a smart risk to take. Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© Syndrome is an extremely complex disorder that would take a really long time to fully explain, so the best information on the disorder itself can be found on medical sites. That said, yes, it's painful. I'm always in pain, even when I'm not flaring. I get random neuropathy, mostly in my extremities. Sometimes, it's just irritating. Other times, it's very painful. The daily non-flare/non-relapse issues are mainly generalized weakness, neuropathy, and severe fatigue. I have back and neck problems from it and I get headaches constantly. I have horrible allergies, which is pretty typical with auto-immune disorders. I still occasionally use a wheelchair depending on the situation I'm in and how my body is feeling that day. Flare-ups usually cause those daily symptoms to get a whole lot worse. My arms and legs will decide not to work. They aren't paralyzed, I still have sensation, but the muscles decide to tap out for a while. The fatigue is extreme and I spend most of my time sleeping. And yeah, the pain is a lot worse, too. Relapses......well, the last time, I was so weak and my nervous system was so messed up that I couldn't even sit up for more than five minutes at a time. I had to learn how to do tasks while lying down, using a pillow or something to prop my head up enough to see/eat/drink/etc. Any time I had to actually get up to do something, I'd usually end up lying on the ground gasping for air after a couple of minutes. It's extremely hard to breathe. Temporary paralysis happens. It's just not a fun time. And thank you for the well-wishes, I appreciate it a lot. :)  
Wow, thank you very much for taking the type to give such an extensive elaboration. I'm sorry you have to live with that, guy/girl. It sounds horrible. Do you at least take medicine for it? Gabapentin or pregabalin maybe? I imagine they'd help better than opiates for the actual neuropathy, gabapentin helps my neuropathy like magic. Much respect mate.  
No problem at all! There really isn't any medication for GBS. The mechanism of the neuropathy is difficult to address. I rarely take any painkillers since the daily amount of pain is manageable. I'm on psych meds and painkillers don't always mix well. It's an annoying balancing act. But I do take some on the occasions that the pain gets bad enough that I can't move, or if the intensity makes me vomit. Thankfully, that doesn't happen too often.  
Is IviG a possibility? My dad has Chronic GBS and the iViG has saved him.  
Not sure if it helps to add this, but Gabapentin is also used off-label as a psych med. My friend was prescribed it as part of her regimen for anxiety and bipolar disorder.  
So now you must rely on herd immunity to stay alive.   I wish anti-vaxers realized that there are people that are immune compromised that need those of us that are healthy and able to be vaccinated so they don't get sick.  
Have you tried gabapentin for the pain? Ive had nerve issues for over a decade. Then a new nerve issue arose and they gave me gabapentin. I'm almost back to pre nerve pain normal. Just a sharp pain here and there vs all day.  
I take Gabapentin for pain issues cause by Ehlers Danlos Syndrome as well as endometriosis and it's various complications. I wouldn't be a functional human without it.  @HighlyIronicAcid asked about dosage, I'm on 600 twice a day, and I do have some memory issues but the brain fog from being in pain is way worse for me than whatever the meds are doing to my memory. Plus it helps with a lifetime of anxiety and insomnia. I'm sorry if it negatively affected one of your loved ones! It helps me live more normally and my younger brother live with fewer seizures.  
How are you doing?  
Honestly, life is a real struggle. I never know when my GBS is going to decide to flare up and there's no way to tell how long the flare-ups are going to last. I could also have another relapse at any time. Living with so many unknowns isn't the easiest. It's hard to make commitments, and when the symptoms are combined with those from my other health issues, it's impossible to work any kind of regular job. I struggle mentally, emotionally, physically, and financially every single day. It's hard to do everyday tasks. I have to give myself pep talks and take breaks to get through a shower. If I go anywhere that requires me to walk for an extended period of time, I do have to use a wheelchair. But I've also had some incredible life experiences that I wouldn't trade for anything. I've lived and studied in Japan, spent a few weeks in England, worked for a video-game developer (as a customer service and tech support rep, but still) during a "good health" stint, met a lot of my personal heroes, and done/experienced a lot of other really cool stuff. I won't lie about it being hard, but I've still gotten to live a lot of life that even perfectly healthy people don't get the chance to. I don't remember what it's like to not be weak and in pain, even on my good days, but I've adapted. Life goes on and sometimes it's really good.  
I was diagnosed with GBS one year ago next week. I believe mine was from an antibiotic that I was given after a procedure, but did you have facial paralysis? I don‚Äôt know a lot of people with GBS, let alone those whose faces went numb. Mine is still numb, was just curious. Stay strong, us GBS fighters have to stick together and know how strong we really have to be! üê¢üíô  
Your honesty and positivity are inspiring.  
If ya ever need to vent, my inbox is open.  
You are a hero!  
I love this response...  It frames you as a person with ups and downs like everyone else. Unlike some other people wich their disability/shortcoming defines them.  
But thats okay right? You like livinf with a disease that encapsulates uncertainty. You would do the vaccine again, and different ones. Better alive than dead, right?  You know what the definition of insanity is right? Look it up, might find a picture of your face in the front.  
Hi! I decided to click on your profile and I saw that you posted in r/OffMyChest about putting in an offer for a house ‚Äî I wanted to comment there, but I‚Äôm banned for some reason. I just wanted to say that I‚Äôm glad to hear that you‚Äôre doing well and that I‚Äôm so proud of you for becoming a homeowner!  
How do Karen‚Äôs look at you knowing that you have been hurt by vaccines but still support them?  
They actually accuse me of being a well-paid shill for big pharma. My bank account balance says otherwise.  
Strange. My mum likes to use vaccine-injured people like you as a reason to propagate her anti-vaxx beliefs.  
Surprisingly, I've rarely had people use my story as validation for their fear of vaccines. Anywhere I could see it, at least. But I've made my stance on that line of thinking very clear. One person having a reaction like mine is so much better than 999,999 others being unprotected against preventable diseases that can and will kill a lot of them.  
I commend you for being able to see that. It sickens me how my mum talks about vaccine injuries as if the people who experience them are just props for her ideology. Unfortunately you are at a good position to propagate unhealthy ideologies but instead you promote what‚Äôs right, which is actually very powerful. I hope that someday you can find something that improves your quality of life, maybe a new kind of therapy or even a general improvement in your health. And hopefully incidences of vaccine injuries can be reduced even further in the future, or at least have them occur with much less severity.  
This mentality makes you a hero. even though you didn't seek out being this one person for the sake of the others, you're being amazing.  
Does your mom drive a car? Because she's a huge fucking hypocrite for using something that injures way more than 1/1,000,000 without campaigning against it.  
r/insaneparents  
oh so they pay you in cash then?  
I was going to make a joke about having fat wads of cash hidden under my mattress, but now I'm just sad that I don't have fat wads of cash hidden under my mattress.  
You should have big wads of cash, though. Or a fat bank account. The rest of us owe it to people like you. There should be insurance for cases like yours built into vaccination. Not something people have to pay for, but something provided by universal health care. Getting vaccinated is a service to self, as well as a service to others. We owe a debt to those who incur injury in the process, especially as life-affecting as yours.  
If it makes you feel better, a lumpy mattress probably makes for bad sleep.  
[deleted]  
If anyone from big pharma wants to send some money my way, I definitely won't complain!  
Isn‚Äôt there a government fund that provides support for legit vaccine related injuries?  
There is, but, unfortunately, I didn't know about it until my period of eligibility had expired.  
Someone once told me I work for the Anunnaki then I said okay well pay me more and I'll tell you the Earth is flat whatever  
This gave me a good laugh.  
[deleted]  
I mean, I wouldn't protest if they wanted to offer me the position.  
Are you in any way affiliated with big pharma?  
I like you! I like your attitude and I like the way you write. I think we‚Äôd really get along in real life. Announcement over.  
Were you told you‚Äôre not allowed to receive certain shots in the future? My partner was recently diagnosed with GBS and was advised not to get the flu shot again. Also I thought GBS eventually goes away and if the symptoms continue to flare up it‚Äôs most likely CIDP?  
Yes, I was. Doctors have advised me to not receive any more vaccinations at all due to the state of my immune system. Which is really scary, especially right now. You're correct, 70% of people with GBS recover within three years and never experience any symptoms again. Technically, GBS never fully goes away and can be triggered again by another extreme immune response, but most people never have an issue with it after they recover. CIDP is very similar and symptoms that persist absolutely can be a sign of CIDP. There are, however, a slim minority of GBS survivors who continue having symptoms of GBS and even experience full relapses. There isn't much knowledge on it yet. I think that I've read every study on it that's out there. But it has been observed in some particularly unlucky individuals like myself. Also, I wish your partner good health and a speedy full recovery! GBS is no fun but recovery is very likely!  
Thanks for your reply. I‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôre one of the unlucky ones with ongoing issues. My partner is already onto his third dose of ivig since he got GBS in July so drs were thinking it might be CIDP but the lumbar puncture results still suggest GBS. I can already see what a toll this horrible syndrome takes on people :( as he is struggling a lot emotionally as well as obviously physically. Do you get ivig when you have flare ups or one of the other treatment methods? Wishing you better health for the future too, hoping you can eventually overcome this nasty condition.  
So far, it's been the opinion of the doctors that I've seen that I've had GBS for so long that any treatment would be ineffective. If I do have another complete relapse, though, I will definitely pursue IVIG treatments. If there's even a tiny chance that it will hope, I'm happy to try it.  
I assumed GBS that keeps giving you flare ups My daughter has CIDP.  She was diagnosed with GBS and when it came back they rediagnosed her with CIDP. She got it when she was 4 and she‚Äôs 11 now. She does really well with ivig treatments, along with iv solumedrol and CellCept. The damage might already be done for you, but it may be worth a shot to get on an IVIG regimen.  The combination of solumedrol and ivig really made such a huge difference for her. I know how nasty this disorder is. I hope you find relief soon.  
Did you go to "vaccine court" aka National Vaccine injury Compensatory Program? Were you awarded any money? What was the process like?  
I wish I had a more positive answer to this, but no, I didn't. As a kid, I had no idea that the program existed. Unfortunately, my parents didn't know, either. It wasn't as high-profile 15 years ago as it is now. By the time that I learned about it, the period of eligibility had expired. And, while I think that it's kind of ridiculous for there to even be a period of eligibility for something like this as long as there is a history of medical documentation to prove a patient's timeline, the rules are the rules and my hands are tied.  
I am so sorry to hear that.  
It's honestly okay. As much as I could use the money, I could REALLY use the money, I'm not too upset about it. It is what it is. I don't blame anyone for what happened so I don't feel like I'm owed some kind of compensation.  
Do you at least receive disability benefits?  
Your post triggered me, as I'm (Dutch, f, 33) also one of these 1/1mil üòä and strongly pro-vax! So afraid I'll get sick, because other people don't vaccinate...  You wrote, that you're always in pain. I know what you mean. Hopefully, you'll learn how to deal with and accept the pain. My therapist once asked me if my pain was only negative, but it also made me stronger and makes me see the world in a different way. How do you feel about your pain, for that matter? Very trivial, but how do you feel about traveling? I find it kinda sad, that I'm not able to visit countries where you'd need to be vaccinated before visiting them.  
The pain can be hard to handle sometimes, but I don't have overwhelmingly negative feelings about it. I've accepted my situation for what it is and I do the best that I can. Honestly, I don't even give it much thought anymore. Focusing on the negative makes everything seem negative. I'm definitely not happy to be in pain but I don't let it have much power over me. I ignore it as much as possible whenever I can, but I also accept that I need a lot of rest and if the pain is telling me to stop something, I should stop it, at least for a little bit so I can recuperate. I'm sorry, that isn't a very clear answer. I think that the best way to explain it is that I've accepted the pain as a part of myself and my life. It doesn't make me happy but I don't resent it and I don't dwell on it. I love traveling so, so much. But yeah, I also find it sad that there are places that I can't visit. At the same time, I know that it's for the best, both for me and for the people in those areas. I would hate to unwittingly carry a harmful disease into am area where people are particularly susceptible to it. The rules are there for a reason and I won't try to break them. There's still a LOT of the world that I can visit and that makes me very happy.  
Exactly! I feel the same way! I would love to visit Cuba, but not until it's safe for both me and the people in that environment to go there without being vaccinated (maybe one day, there will be pills to take).  And the pain is something you get used to, isn't it? I know it's there, but mostly I kind of block the negativity, just like you said. So I think your answer is very clear ;)  Good luck!!!  
Can you recall exactly what happened that day?  
Yes, I remember it vividly. Not the appointment itself, but what happened afterward. It started with my arm swelling up so big that my swim teammates were teasing me about doing steroids. It was probably three times its usual size and it really hurt. Then I started having serious breathing problems somewhere from 24 to 48 hours after the injection. From there, it was a rapid decline into a very severe illness that I genuinely can't fully remember because I was pretty messed up. But I do remember that my muscles seemingly atrophied overnight (it was a problem with the nerves, not the muscles, but that's what it felt like) and I had extreme breathing difficulty. Then the paralysis attacks started. And stroke-like symptoms. And I was suddenly hyper allergic to everything. It was a lot for 14-year-old me to handle.  
Do you remember what other, if any, vaccines you had that same day? You mentioned that you were behind in vaccines and I'm wondering if it could've been triggered by having several in one sitting. Pro-vax, just curious if this is plausible.  
I only received the TDaP. It was the only one that was required by the school so it's the only one that I got.  
I'm curious on this as well because I have a friend who is anti-vax and this is a common argument. I often find myself needing to look shit up and then she questions my knowledge on it and starts going down the "see I've spent a lot of time researching this and..." so I'd appreciate OPs input here.  
How did your parents/guardians react to what happened? Do they continue to support vaccines with the same humble reflection that you show?  
Oof, that's a complicated question. My dad has Asperger's and he doesn't always process emotions well or know how to handle intense situations, so he became pretty much absent and never expressed how he felt about any of it. My mom..........is a complex individual. She's also a bit of a Karen. My doctors at the time were pretty terrible and I didn't get a diagnosis for a while so my mom became obsessed with figuring out what it was. She spent just about every waking moment doing research on the internet, which we all know is a fantastic idea, especially for a Karen. It was a weird time and I was pretty much on my own when I wasn't at some kind of specialist appointment. Nowadays, my dad is pretty clear that he supports vaccines. He had a relative with tetanus back in the day and it made a huge impression on him because of how horrible it was. Also, since he's on the spectrum, he finds the idea of vaccines causing autism to be pretty funny. My mom is a difficult to answer for. I think that she's come around from thinking that vaccines are dangerous poison, and she's smart enough to recognize that the measles outbreak is a direct result of people not getting vaccinated, but I doubt that she'll ever fully abandon her Karen ways. At the very least, she does NOT go around spouting anti-vax propaganda or spreading misinformation on vaccines, and she definitely doesn't tell people not to get their kids vaccinated. So she's a pretty harmless Karen.  
My little brother had a reaction to the TDaP vaccines as well and ended up not speaking for two years when he was younger. He‚Äôs healthy now and able to take vaccines again, but that combination is unhealthy itself. I don‚Äôt know that much about it, but I‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôve been struggling with this for so long!  
Thank you! And I'm very happy that your brother is healthy now!  
[deleted]  
I regularly joke that I won the lottery twice.  
most children have had two tdap vaccines by the time they're 14. did you have any reactions to the ones you received before that? if not, what do doctors say about you not having a reaction to the previous ones? or did you not receive them and if not, why not?  
I did receive a TDaP shot when I was very young. I don't personally remember anything about it but my mom told me that I did get very sick afterward and nobody knew what was wrong. I don't remember exactly when it happened but it was probably in 1990 or 1991. At the time, vaccines weren't really considered by most doctors as a cause for seemingly random illnesses so I don't think that it was even on their radar. And I did eventually get better, so they wrote it off as a "who knows?"/"babies are weird" kind of situation. I also remember getting some kind of vaccination when I was just old enough to remember anything, and I only remember it because I hid under a chair in a brilliant attempt to avoid the doctor. I don't know what it was, though. I do, however, know that I was not up to date on my vaccinations when I was 14. I don't remember what I'd missed, but I would assume that I received the TDaP shot at that point because I wasn't caught up. It was part of a physical in order to get the okay to swim for a local highschool's team and it was the only vaccine that they absolutely required me to be up to date on.  
Did you die?  
I woke up dead the next morning.  
Here is a gold to pay for funeral, thank  
My family and friends appreciate.  
[deleted]  
If it's possible, absolutely. I believe that they eventually will, I just don't know how long it will take. And it will never be 100% accurate because nothing is 100% accurate. But if they can find some way to determine who is predisposed to have an adverse reaction, that would be wonderful.  
I‚Äôm so sorry that this happened to you. The same thing happened to my best friends son 2 years ago. He was 8 years old and woke up one morning and couldn‚Äôt move his legs. He was also diagnosed with Guillaine-Barre Syndrome. He spent the next 2 months at Children‚Äôs Hospital LA learning to walk again. It was the saddest thing. He has since recovered but my best friend is in constant fear of him relapsing.  
I'm sorry to hear this. It was hard enough at 14, I can't even imagine going through all of it at eight years old. But I'm so glad to hear that he's recovered. Your friend's fear is valid, but, if it helps at all, usually only about 3% of GBS survivors ever relapse, so it's extremely likely that he'll live a long healthy life and won't ever have to worry about GBS ever again.  
Good work for soldiering on mate. I can't even begin to fathom what it would be like going through all of that. I get a lot of inspiration from people like you who have the most horrifying conditions that make life unbearably hard, but you still live life to the fullest.  
I'm not going to lie, I've had my moments of wanting to give up. I've had some very dark times. But I hold on to all of the good that I have in my life and I keep trying. I still have dreams and passions and as long as I'm still breathing I know that there's still more that I can do.  
What would you say to vaccine-injured people who are anti-vax?  
I've never met any, to be honest. All of the vaccine-injured individuals that I've talked to have understood the importance of herd immunity and agree that the risk of an adverse reaction is negligible compared to the risk of deadly consequences from a preventable disease.  
Help me. I had an adverse reaction and my mom had took it upon herself to become an anti-vaxxer. Why do you think that vaccines are helpful? Please, I need to persuade her.  
I'm just going to say right off the bat that changing an anti-vaxxer's mind is nearly impossible. Their beliefs are very important to them and they tend to immediately write off any argument against them. The best that I can do is say that, yes, vaccines come with a risk. All medical procedures come with a risk. That's the nature of modern medicine. But it's a low risk, and it's negligible when compared to the threat of preventable diseases. We have vaccines because a lot of people used to suffer from horrible diseases like polio, tetanus, smallpox, diphtheria, tuberculosis, etc. Even today, with all of modern treatment options, the mortality rate of tuberculosis is around 15%. The mortality rate of paralytic polio in adults is anywhere from 15% to 30%. And, despite what a lot of anti-vaxxers like to say, the mortality rate of measles is also around 15%. And, as the World Health Organization says, "As for vaccines causing death, again so few deaths can plausibly be attributed to vaccines that it is hard to assess the risk statistically." Anyone who is able to get vaccinated but chooses not to puts themselves and the people around them at serious, potentially deadly risk. There are immunocompromised people, such as people undergoing treatment for cancer (and especially children doing so), who rely on herd immunity, which requires those who are able to get vaccinated. Yes, vaccines come with risk, but not getting vaccinated comes with a much scarier and more harmful risk. For both individuals and the public as a whole to be protected from all of those diseases that have practically been eradicated, people need to get vaccinated.  
Hey there, I also had a reaction to a vaccine, but I‚Äôm not sure it caused any permanent problems. When I was around 12 I want to say..I went and got some of the required shots, I still don‚Äôt remember which shot it was, possibly measles? Nonetheless, over the next week I had severe cramps in the leg I got my shot in and I was unable to walk whatsoever, if I put even the tiniest amount of pressure onto that leg, I would fall on the ground screaming from how badly it hurt. Just curious, what were some of the first symptoms you had experienced from the shot/shots?  
First, my arm swelled up about three times its usual size and was very painful. Then, somewhere in the time frame of 24 to 48 hours after the shot, I started having serious difficulty breathing.  
Wow. That is terrifying, I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that you unfortunately were dealt that hand, but I am happy to know you‚Äôre making the absolute best of it. You‚Äôre the same as everybody else out there, just stronger to be honest for being able to deal with everything the way you do. Mad respect to you!  
Hi, I think I've seen some of your tweets before. Massive respect to you for being so open.  My question is not about anti-vaxxers, as I've argued enough with them in my time!  I have spoken to staunch pro-vax people who flat out refuse to believe that anyone has genuinely been vaccine injured. Do you often get people trying to "debunk" your injury and argue with you? Edited to add another question as it's just popped into my head. Do you have a child/children? Or plan to have children? If so, would they be susceptible to a reaction too? Or is it in no way genetic?  
Yes, I've definitely had this happen and it's frustrating. Thankfully, it's only been a few people. I find it foolish to believe that any medical procedure is 100% safe, but I've found that arguing the issue with them is as pointless as arguing it with staunch anti-vaxxers. I say my piece and then I move on. I don't have children and I don't think that I ever will. But, if I did, there's definitely a possibility that they could be susceptible to an adverse reaction. There's no definitive conclusion on whether or not it has a genetic component, but, from what I've read, it's been accepted as a possibility.  
Have your parents/friends view on vaccines changed because of your reaction? How's life like? Work? Home? Relationships? The fact that you still support vaccinations is brilliant and deserves way more that shinny Reddit things.  
My mom's views definitely shifted more toward the anti-vax camp, but she unfortunately fell into the rabbit hole of online "research" on vaccines and, as I've mentioned before, she's a bit of a Karen. But I've done my best to help bring her back around as much as I possibly can. Nobody else's views changed. All of my friends are strongly pro-vax, as are my dad and brothers. One of the top replies on here has a pretty good explanation of how my health issues continue to impact my daily life. Please forgive me for not repeating all of it; I'm not trying to be lazy or short, my thumbs are just tired from all the typing. I don't work at the moment. I'm on disability. But I've had many, many jobs before and I have a good resume, so if my health allows at any point in the future, I will definitely return to whatever work I can reasonably do. Home and relationships......are complicated, but surprisingly not as impacted by my GBS as one might think. A lot of people nowadays are pretty understanding when it comes to physical disabilities. I mean, there's a lot that they don't understand, but they're willing to try, and that's all I ever ask. I definitely feel like a burden to the people closest to me from time to time, but I've learned how to manage my condition as well as I can and I don't put any expectations on them for helping me. I'm beyond grateful for all of the help that I do receive out of the kindness of their hearts, but I also know how to take care of myself most of the time. Open communication is vital and I've learned a lot of communication skills over the years. That's definitely helped me to maintain the relationships that I have.  
Wipes Forehead woah, I almost thought it said anivax  
Hahaha, when I first told my story on Twitter, I learned my lesson about specifying right away that I'm pro-vax. Thankfully, most people took the time to read the whole thread, but I got a lot of "they had us in the first half" reaction gifs.  
Is anyone in your family antivax and if so why?  
My mom has been a little anti-vax because she's a little bit of a Karen, but she's mostly come around. And, very thankfully, she never tries to discourage anyone from getting their kids vaccinated.  
But would you support more effort being put into vaccine safety seeing as how you are living proof that there are still issues with something they want literally every single person on the planet to get? And FYI  the stats on vaccine injuries are little higher than 1 in a million, but even at that number you are looking at 7.5 million children who will experience some or other problem associated with vaccination and when  you look at the reality of the actual numbers as opposed to the percentages, it suddenly looks a whole lot less like nothing and lot like something you can't blithely ignore.  
I have looked at the stats on vaccine injury and I have done a lot of my own research. I see nothing compelling that leads me to believe that the majority of reported "vaccine injuries" have anything at all to do with vaccines. But I'm not going to spend much time going down that road because I've found that arguing about that specific topic is a huge waste of energy for everyone involved. But, to answer your question, no. Any medical procedure comes with risk. Medical professionals can never guarantee how anyone's body is going to react to anything and we can't expect them to. It's unrealistic. People die from everyday procedures all the time, ones that should be "safe." There is no way to guarantee absolute safety. Do I think that they should always be looking for the safest way to do anything that they do? Absolutely. But there will always be people like me no matter what they do. We have to accept that.  
Here is my issue with this argument. There is a difference, and hopefully one you can appreciate, between something only given to someone if and when they need it, and something that is being made mandatory for every man, woman and child. Imagine if we woke up tomorrow and air was toxic for 1% of the total population. Everyone has to breathe it, but some people can't. Would you genuinely shrug it off as an acceptable risk   because  well you know everyone else gets to breath it safely? To make matters worse, you aren't allowed to object to lack of air safety - you will be vilified and legislated against. You won't be able to demand an alternative or use clean bottled air because what is wrong with you 'air is safe', and the systems to ensure air safety will look like something from the dark ages.  But yes, let's go with the acceptable risk argument. It makes perfect sense.  
Breathing air is very different from having a medical procedure performed. Medical science is extremely complicated because the human body is complex and unpredictable. What we know for certain, though, is that these vaccines were developed due to a legitimate need for protection from dangerous diseases that are now, thanks to those vaccines, largely preventable. The minimal risk that they pose is absolutely one that I find acceptable.  
you are dodging my question. If vaccinations were optional, I'd agree with you, but governments all around the world are removing your right to choose to take the risk or not. All other medical procedures you are comparing it to are by choice. And you sign a consent form after long discussions with the doctors about all the risks and the alternatives if any etc. None of this happens with vaccines. Your choice is gone, the informing part is either not done, or vastly underplayed, you certainly are not properly informed as to what you should look out for if there is a reaction. In addition anyone who questions the safety of vaccines (and the track record is not amazingly fantastic here with all kinds of mistakes and poor quality control etc) is vilified and threatened with legal action in some countries over and above other serious consequences. So my air analogy is far more valid than your medical procedures where the choice is often dying or take a chance.  You  yourself weren't in any immediate danger of dying, your parents didn't have to make that kind of choice. They were told that vaccines were perfectly safe and probably were not fully informed of the risks and you've been left with a life-long chronic illness (and TBH you got off lightly, other parents have been left with disabled, comatose and severely sick children) yet somehow you are incapable of agreeing that vaccines should absolutely be held to the highest possible safety standards without exception.  
Do people use you/your story in anti-vaxx  propaganda?  
Not that I've seen. And I'm very grateful for that. I've had a handful of individuals say something along the lines of, "This is why people are scared," but I've shut that down as best as I can. I understand parents being afraid of something happening to their children, but they need to be afraid of the preventable diseases that are making a comeback due to their anti-vax nonsense.  
I agree, anti vaxxers scare me. My son has a few congenital defects and we have to be careful of respiratory viruses as he can‚Äôt really handle any extra work of breathing. He got influenza last month but it was a strain he was vaccinated against a few months prior and it was mild. I feel lucky almost. It could have been a different type.  
If you had the power to get all of the Karens to get their fucking shit together with a snap of your fingers, would you do it? Also, much respect to you.  
Yes. In a millisecond. I'm fine with people having conspiracy theories or being irrational when they're not harming anyone, but the anti-vax movement is so dangerous and it needs to end.  
Has there been any research as to what was in the TDaP vaccine that your body reacted to, such as preservatives, etc.?  (Pro-vax here, btw)  
No definitive research, no. But it likely wasn't any particular ingredient that caused it. GBS can be triggered by any strong immune reaction. At least 50% of GBS cases are triggered by a viral infection like the flu. I've heard of cases of GBS being triggered by pregnancy. For whatever reason, my body had an unusually strong immune reaction to the vaccine, and that was the trigger. The exact cause of GBS isn't understood well right now so it's impossible to know if my body was particularly weak to that specific vaccine, all vaccines, or if I'm perhaps allergic to an ingredient. There are a lot of unknowns right now but I'm hopeful that they'll find answers in the near future.  
Fascinating AMA by the way. In Japan they stopped giving the trivalent MMR shot in favour or single valent versions of each because of what seemed to be significant increase in GBS among MMR recipients. The theory was that the combination vaccine was just too much all at once for naive immune systems, so spreading the vaccinations out over time would help. In light of this, do you think that DTaP might be better administered in three single valent shots spread out over time rather than the combination shot all at once?  
I don't have enough medical expertise to know exactly how separating the vaccine into single valent shots would affect the average human body, but it's definitely possible that it could have better results and lower risk. I'm all for trying things like that if it will be safer.  
I don't mean anything negative by this. And I hope what I'm trying to say comes out right. But I'm happy you have experienced beautiful moments in life even though you've had a hard time. What happened to you wasn't fair, and you didn't deserve it but if you think about it, maybe because of what happened to you, many other were saved from the same disability. I'm sure you agree that even if vaccines might hurt us in some ways, they save us in many other ways. Sometimes one people get some kind of disability, or maybe someone dies because of a medicine but at the same time thanks to that person doctors might be able to save thousand of others from getting the same disability or dying by changing what's wrong with the medicine or vaccine. Even though I don't know you, I'm proud that you're trying so hard in life and not giving up and I want to thank you, because like I said, how your body reacted to the vaccine might have saved many others from going through the same hard things you went through. Have a nice day and be proud of yourself.  
So are you on disability? Who helps take care of you when you can't sit up for example.  
Yes, I am on disability. My family has been a huge support in this whole situation, and I've had close friends help, as well. I still do most things for myself, but I also have a support system for the times when I'm physically incapable of doing anything. I'll soon be moving in with my best friend who is an angel and is willing to help me whenever I need it. I'm extremely grateful to everyone who's helped to keep me alive all this time.

I'm very artistic, but I don't think that the vaccine had anything to do with that. But, on a serious note, no, I'm not on the autism spectrum.  
I read last night that someone was recently awarded millions to be paid out over the next handful of years based on a case where their asymptomatic 18 month old (now almost 30 years old) received a vaccine and was later diagnosed with autism. The article says that while the case was settled outside of court and the records were sealed, the doctors involved explicitly stated that the vaccine itself never caused the autism, only that it may have agrivated some dormant mitochondrial dna or something like that. I feel like this sets a dangerous precedent for anti-vaxxers of basically "it doesn't matter if we're wrong, if we don't stop fighting, the government will get annoyed and pay out, which we could go on to say 'I was right all along'."  What are your thoughts on this?  
Oh dear. I would have to read up on the case to give a fully educated opinion, but the idea of that happening disturbs me. Anti-vaxxers assume that a civil judgment in favor of a parent claiming vaccine injury indisputably proves that vaccines caused the problem, and that's just not how it works. Those kinds of judgments make them feel vindicated and gives them the boldness to shout even louder. It's troubling, to say the least.  
Surely it's even less than 1:1,000,000. If that's the number, there are 7,500+ people in the world that this happens to.  
It could be less! That's just the most widely accepted number in the medical community at the moment, from what I've read and heard from doctors.  
So there are some vaccine-injured kids that are actually fine (not implying that you're one of them at all, keep reading). My friend has a son who "reacted poorly" to one of the routine vaccines as a toddler. Apparently, after having the shot, his sleep patterns changed and he was cranky that day. Because you know, toddlers are never simply cranky sometimes and sleep very regularly without deviation. She now uses that as justification to not vaccinate the rest of her kids. Anyways, is it annoying that so many Karens will conflate literally anything around the time of vaccinations as evidence of vaccine injury, seeing as you've actually suffered? For example, if I broke my neck and became paraplegic after falling down the stairs, I'd be annoyed if some Karen came up to me saying that her son is just like me, because as a toddler he walked down some stairs once and later that day had a few tantrums. I'm just imagining myself trying to deal with garbage like that. Does that kind of thing ever bother you? Or have you learned a lot of patience over the years?  
Shit man, get on Ellen to share your story. There are so many anti-vax people out there that it‚Äôs posing a serious risk to the future of our species.  People would rather let their kid catch, communicate and die from preventable diseases than risk their child having autism, GBS or other conditions. It‚Äôs sickening. There are parents who are so scared of having a special needs child that they‚Äôd rather let their kid catch smallpox and kill half a country.  
So sorry to hear about this, my grandad was diagnosed with this a few months before he passed away, he got it from a simple common cold. Unfortunately he never got to make a full recovery and sadly passed away from complications in February 2018. I‚Äôm from a small town in the UK and nobody had ever seen anything like it in the local hospital, experts were being brought in from everywhere and it took them weeks to diagnose it as guillain barre syndrome. My family now regularly fundraise for the gain charity who support people with this. Check them out - gainGAIN  
What are you taking for the pain? Have you tried weed?  
I‚Äôm related to your evil alternate persona, where instead of being pro-vax they became pro-TERRA and it‚Äôs the worst thing ever. They aren‚Äôt even so permanently afflicted. But damn if that dumbass MLM didn‚Äôt take over their life.  What do you say to people like that?  
Was this due to a flu shot? My grandpa had that happen to him many years ago. I am pro-vax, but I‚Äôm a little scared to get a flu shot. I‚Äôm not sure if I would be at a higher risk since he had it, so I‚Äôm a little too scared to get it myself.  
Have the anti-vax movement tried to use you as some kind of symbol?  
Why do you still support vaccines even though you were injured in pro vax too but is it because of the fact that it‚Äôs rarer than getting sick when did you notice do people accuse you of being paid by big pharma?(why did someone downvote this is it because of my bad grammar)(I‚Äôm j‚Äùnot anti vax)  
Yes, it's because vaccines do much more good than harm and the risk of having an adverse reaction to a vaccine is much, much lower than the risk of being harmed by the diseases that vaccines prevent. And yes, people love to accuse me of being paid by big pharma.  
I want to thank you for taking the time out of day to respond and I feel horrible you that people have the audacity to use people like you to use it for their own propaganda I wish you the best  
There are a lot more. Statistics are falsified / unreliable. https://youtu.be/KOK_rgr5U7w https://vaccineimpact.com/2017/gardasil-killed-my-16-year-old-daughter-she-died-the-most-excruciating-painful-death/  
Someone should let the health insurance industry and life insurance industry know. Having worked in analytics departments in both, every single model we produced (updated weekly/monthly depending on the specific model) showed that vaccines led to better health outcomes and longer lifespans, even after controlling for all other factors. I mean, you clearly know what you're talking about and could save these multi-billion-dollar industries a lot of money. You should waltz into one of those companies right now and tell them that all of their analysts are doing the math wrong, and to rely on you. You obviously know more about statistics than those have have multiple degrees in that very subject, such as myself and other colleagues I work with. What you have goes against what every single health insurance company and life insurance company has independently found about how safe and effective vaccines are at improving life outcomes on a large scale, or in other words, how benefits massively outweigh the costs. So by all means, go and try to convince one of these companies to hire you. Billions of dollars of profit are at stake (not dying = profit for life insurers, not getting sick = profit for health insurers), and these companies continually try to find and maintain a strong competitive edge. I maintain subscriptions to industry news, so I'll be waiting to read about a revolutionary predictive model about how vaccines are dangerous and to trash all our data because [random citizen] knows better.  
So what you're saying is, vaccines increase the profitability of insurance companies, because they don't pay out as many policies?   Welp, time to become an anti vaxxer then.  
Oh no.  
Yeah, for every reply I will add a report on a vaccine injured / killed person. This is for you: https://vaccineimpact.com/2017/gardasil-killed-my-16-year-old-daughter-she-died-the-most-excruciating-painful-death/  
This is not the place to spread misinformation, and beyond this reply, I will not interact with it.  
As much as my brain is telling me to argue this ridiculous story, I'm not going to even give it the time of day.  
This is the same story as you posted above, fucktard  
The anti vax movement is most likely responsible for more dead children then vaccines ever will be.  Please re-examine your moral compass.  
 Oh no.  I hear your "Oh no" and raise you an "Oh dear" and an "Oh my".  
posted this on my main account at first but thought that it'd be better to post it with another one dont know if u will see this, but i've actually wanted to post something similar to your post since im pretty much the same lmao. i got a pandemrix shot though, i think i've also gotten it twice in my life, as a really small kid, and as a like 6-7 year old.  not sure if anything happened the first time but the second time was pretty bad. no one knew what it was about, but i've had a lot of issues with my stomach since around the 2nd time, no one even thought about them being related to each other. then i also started having a lot of headaches and sleepiness etc. , we went to some doctors but i guess nothing was really found. then there was like 1 year of almost nothing, i was basically perfectly healthy. but then when i was 10 or 11 i got a really high fever, probably like 40-41¬∞c (104-105 F) and was really sick, and on the worst night i started coughing blood. we went to a hospital, i cant remember anything about actully being there but i remember me and my mom meeting my dad there, whose finger was literally cut in half when he was working overtime. ok back to the actual story. after that night i've had a lot of different diagnoses, mostly from private hospitals / clinics, because the public hospitals here, for one reason or another, didn't admit that anything like this existed. basically they said that all of my symptoms were psychological and neurological at all. my symptoms include: migraine, awful fucking stomachaches, sleepiness similar to narcolepsy, and ive been using wheelchairs and crutches from time to time, in total for probably 3 years, because i havent been able to walk due to no-fucking-idea, probably some stuff to do with nerves, and i haven't been able to attend school normally for over 5 years because of all these. my parents have spent at least 20k ‚Ç¨ to get me treatment from private hospitals and the treatment would totally be available for free from public hospitals, if they only would give it. but we do also get some money for my disabilities, not much tho. but yea, so far my 16 year long life has been quite hard. accusations of basically faking not being able to walk properly for at least 4 years and the rest of the stuff. at least im now diagnosed with CFS, which has symptoms that i do have, but still nothing even close to the full illness. haven't lived a normal life for 5 years, but i've also had some experiences I'd never give away, with of course the addition of experiences that i gladly would erase from my memory. probably forgot some important stuff but that doesn't matter lmao.  well it seems like i wrote a whole book worth of text, but wanted to also share my experiences. i wish u good luck in the future! edit: forgot to mention that there have been similar cases to mine here where i live, so its not like im the only one that the doctors don't believe  
Is there not a way that doctors can work with people like you, and identify the genetic markers that might highlight who would be adversely affected? Have you ever been approached for something like this?  
I'm not familiar with the terminologies. What tests are available to check if someone can take the TDaP vaccine?  
Whats it like having to stay away from potentially dangerous areas? (like places you might get a disease you‚Äôre not vaccinated for)  
So are you unable to get ANY vaccinations ever again? Or just Tdap?  
Have they ruled out cidp if you're experiencing a significant number of flares?  
What are the symptoms of GBS?  
The NIH has a good overview of GBS. I would just add that, for me, breathing difficulty has been one of my most severe symptoms. https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-sheets/Guillain-Barr√©-Syndrome-Fact-Sheet  
How are you feeling today?  
I'm very fatigued and have the terrible exhaustion headache that I'm all too familiar with. But the response to this AMA has me feeling so grateful and blessed, so the exhaustion isn't bothering me too much.  
I'm glad the AMA is working out for you! You have a favorite movie?  
Yes! My favorite movie is The Fall. It's beautiful and has a lot of personal significance for me. If you haven't watched it yet, you definitely should!  
I don't think I know it at all. I'll make sure to give it a watch. You have a favorite movie genre?  
how many karen-fangirls you have?  
Do you know if they are researching a way to test if someone will have a "reaction"(?) such as yours??  
Did you ever have the flu before getting the TDaP? It has a higher occurance if you did. Just curious  
We all appreciate the fact that you still realise the good in vaccines. It must be horrible having such a severe reaction to it so good luck on it getting better in the near future. I‚Äôve never really thought about it but I‚Äôm lucky with vaccines and my body in general because I never get ill and have only been ill a few times in my life and so thats why I really feel for you man. Have a good day :)  
Does it annoy you much that some people choose not to vaccinate, reducing herd immunity and putting you at risk?  
hi... do you watch anime?üòÅ  
Have anti-vaxers used you as evidence/proof?  
Makes sense as you depend on herd immunity more so than most  
[deleted]  
How was it seeing an NFL player deal with the same syndrome you have? Was it comforting knowing that elite athletic ability is still possible with the syndrome?  
I'm assuming you have to live out in the country to avoid Major illnesses like the Flu, Malaria , etc  
I had a ‚Äúvaccine injury‚Äù as well when I was 13. (Dysautonomia from Gardasil. I had a much higher than ‚Äúnormal‚Äù chance of that happening because of a congenital disease I have as well as from having scarlet fever as a child. Unfortunately, I got the vaccine in the first wave of it, before the link to my other condition and the scarlet fever had been studied...) I still get all the inoculations that are available and vaccinated my kid, but I‚Äôll admit to being probably WAY too helicopter parent when it came time for her to have the same vaccine I reacted to. Thankfully, my common sense won in the end and she was fine.  I‚Äôm extremely pro-vax (is that even a thing or should I just say I‚Äôm a decent human being...) and I always feel like I can‚Äôt tell anyone what my neuro-damage was from because I don‚Äôt want them to latch onto my EXTREMELY rare case as an excuse to not vaccinate their kids. I am also immunocompromised, and my father figure died from complications of him being immunodeficient as well, so I am INCREDIBLY determined to protect as many people as possible and if that means not mentioning what caused some of my problems, then so be it! (Just FYI, I am clear with doctors and any other medical professionals about what happened, I just do t tell Karens on the street.)  
I have no questions but I just wanna say as a person who is awaiting to be of legal age to go out and vaccinate myself, as my mom of course never did, that you few people are the people that truly would have a reason and that it‚Äôs not just some religious, autism/ADHD and or allergic reaction that can be tested before hand despite being fully able to get me allergy tested which she should have done weeks ago for a different reason regarding some meds I had to take which she never took me to. Still to this day the doctors are a last ditch effort with essential oils coming first which last year left me deaf in my left ear for 2 weeks because she let a nasty ear infection sit with a little bit of OnGuard oil instead of bringing me to the doctor after I asked her for so long. Sorry if this is a tangent, but every time I‚Äôm reminded of this I just have to get it off my chest again.  
You're one in a million!  
So you‚Äôre telling me there‚Äôs a chance!  
r e s p e c t  
My son was injured by vaccines, and people get super pissed at me. I'm strongly for common sense. We give so many shots, so quickly together, and so early (In the US anyway) and no other country does this. It's honestly insane to think about. I'm not saying all shots are bad, I'm saying we need to wait until the kids are a bit older, spread them out more, etc. But when I say things like this, people freak out- clearly I want my kid dead because he's not getting vaccinated.  
I am so sorry that this happened to you. I am also pro-vaccination but always acknowledge and fear the risks when vaccinating my children. For this reason, we don't get flu shots or other less necessary shots. Unfortunately, there's always the risk with those which seem most necessary and other which are required, as big pharma and human biology are fallible, and I always hold my breath. I hope that you recover and will not have to deal with this in the future.  
Wow! I‚Äôm a RN and I‚Äôve only heard one story like this. When my old boss was a brand new nurse she gave someone a flu shot (who was also a nurse) and she developed GBS! We give them to each other in the hospital and it‚Äôs mandated.  Did you ever talk to the person who administered it?  (Obviously it‚Äôs not the fault of the person giving the injection but I imagine they felt guilt. My old boss said it took years to get comfortable with it again.)  
Bless you for still being pro-vax. It‚Äôs terrible that you went through that, but it‚Äôs pretty telling when even someone who actually was negatively effected by a vaccine still supports vaccinations in general.  
Table of Questions and Answers. Original answer linked - Please upvote the original questions and answers.    Question Answer Link    How do Karen‚Äôs look at you knowing that you have been hurt by vaccines but still support them? They actually accuse me of being a well-paid shill for big pharma. My bank account balance says otherwise. Here   How are you doing? Honestly, life is a real struggle. I never know when my GBS is going to decide to flare up and there's no way to tell how long the flare-ups are going to last. I could also have another relapse at any time. Living with so many unknowns isn't the easiest. It's hard to make commitments, and when the symptoms are combined with those from my other health issues, it's impossible to work any kind of regular job. I struggle mentally, emotionally, physically, and financially every single day. It's hard to do everyday tasks. I have to give myself pep talks and take breaks to get through a shower. If I go anywhere that requires me to walk for an extended period of time, I do have to use a wheelchair.  But I've also had some incredible life experiences that I wouldn't trade for anything. I've lived and studied in Japan, spent a few weeks in England, worked for a video-game developer (as a customer service and tech support rep, but still) during a "good health" stint, met a lot of my personal heroes, and done/experienced a lot of other really cool stuff.  I won't lie about it being hard, but I've still gotten to live a lot of life that even perfectly healthy people don't get the chance to. I don't remember what it's like to not be weak and in pain, even on my good days, but I've adapted. Life goes on and sometimes it's really good. Here   Assuming this is true, are you now scared of vaccines that you actually need? Vaccines you get as an adult still (tetanus for example)? Also, can you please elaborate on the Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© Syndrome? Is it painful? Do you have bad nerve pain from it? How is it on a day to day basis, is it always bothering you or only during flare ups/relapses?  Thanks! I hope the best for you and that it leaves you alone man/girl. Stay strong =) Given that I have an auto-immune disorder and could potentially be sensitive to all vaccines, I've been advised not to receive any more. So I haven't been vaccinated since I was 14. It's very possible that another adverse reaction could kill me and even doctors don't think that it's a smart risk to take.  Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© Syndrome is an extremely complex disorder that would take a really long time to fully explain, so the best information on the disorder itself can be found on medical sites.  That said, yes, it's painful. I'm always in pain, even when I'm not flaring. I get random neuropathy, mostly in my extremities. Sometimes, it's just irritating. Other times, it's very painful. The daily non-flare/non-relapse issues are mainly generalized weakness, neuropathy, and severe fatigue. I have back and neck problems from it and I get headaches constantly. I have horrible allergies, which is pretty typical with auto-immune disorders. I still occasionally use a wheelchair depending on the situation I'm in and how my body is feeling that day.  Flare-ups usually cause those daily symptoms to get a whole lot worse. My arms and legs will decide not to work. They aren't paralyzed, I still have sensation, but the muscles decide to tap out for a while. The fatigue is extreme and I spend most of my time sleeping. And yeah, the pain is a lot worse, too.  Relapses......well, the last time, I was so weak and my nervous system was so messed up that I couldn't even sit up for more than five minutes at a time. I had to learn how to do tasks while lying down, using a pillow or something to prop my head up enough to see/eat/drink/etc. Any time I had to actually get up to do something, I'd usually end up lying on the ground gasping for air after a couple of minutes. It's extremely hard to breathe. Temporary paralysis happens. It's just not a fun time.  And thank you for the well-wishes, I appreciate it a lot. :) Here   My little brother had a reaction to the TDaP vaccines as well and ended up not speaking for two years when he was younger. He‚Äôs healthy now and able to take vaccines again, but that combination is unhealthy itself. I don‚Äôt know that much about it, but I‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôve been struggling with this for so long! Thank you! And I'm very happy that your brother is healthy now! Here   Were you told you‚Äôre not allowed to receive certain shots in the future? My partner was recently diagnosed with GBS and was advised not to get the flu shot again. Also I thought GBS eventually goes away and if the symptoms continue to flare up it‚Äôs most likely CIDP? Yes, I was. Doctors have advised me to not receive any more vaccinations at all due to the state of my immune system. Which is really scary, especially right now.  You're correct, 70% of people with GBS recover within three years and never experience any symptoms again. Technically, GBS never fully goes away and can be triggered again by another extreme immune response, but most people never have an issue with it after they recover.  CIDP is very similar and symptoms that persist absolutely can be a sign of CIDP. There are, however, a slim minority of GBS survivors who continue having symptoms of GBS and even experience full relapses. There isn't much knowledge on it yet. I think that I've read every study on it that's out there. But it has been observed in some particularly unlucky individuals like myself.  Also, I wish your partner good health and a speedy full recovery! GBS is no fun but recovery is very likely! Here   wow you even hit the double 'jackpot' as GBS seems to be only 3%-10% chronical.  Big F   edit: just got vaccinated today. wish me luck :p I regularly joke that I won the lottery twice. Here   Good work for soldiering on mate. I can't even begin to fathom what it would be like going through all of that. I get a lot of inspiration from people like you who have the most horrifying conditions that make life unbearably hard, but you still live life to the fullest. I'm not going to lie, I've had my moments of wanting to give up. I've had some very dark times. But I hold on to all of the good that I have in my life and I keep trying. I still have dreams and passions and as long as I'm still breathing I know that there's still more that I can do. Here   Can you recall exactly what happened that day? Yes, I remember it vividly. Not the appointment itself, but what happened afterward. It started with my arm swelling up so big that my swim teammates were teasing me about doing steroids. It was probably three times its usual size and it really hurt. Then I started having serious breathing problems somewhere from 24 to 48 hours after the injection. From there, it was a rapid decline into a very severe illness that I genuinely can't fully remember because I was pretty messed up. But I do remember that my muscles seemingly atrophied overnight (it was a problem with the nerves, not the muscles, but that's what it felt like) and I had extreme breathing difficulty. Then the paralysis attacks started. And stroke-like symptoms. And I was suddenly hyper allergic to everything. It was a lot for 14-year-old me to handle. Here   Did you go to "vaccine court" aka National Vaccine injury Compensatory Program?  Were you awarded any money? What was the process like? I wish I had a more positive answer to this, but no, I didn't. As a kid, I had no idea that the program existed. Unfortunately, my parents didn't know, either. It wasn't as high-profile 15 years ago as it is now. By the time that I learned about it, the period of eligibility had expired. And, while I think that it's kind of ridiculous for there to even be a period of eligibility for something like this as long as there is a history of medical documentation to prove a patient's timeline, the rules are the rules and my hands are tied. Here   Do you think medicine should figure out a test they can do before giving vaccines to determine if someone is the 1/1mil? If it's possible, absolutely. I believe that they eventually will, I just don't know how long it will take. And it will never be 100% accurate because nothing is 100% accurate. But if they can find some way to determine who is predisposed to have an adverse reaction, that would be wonderful. Here   Did you die? I woke up dead the next morning. Here    Source  
People like this man are why I have so much faith in the Karen War. This guy got vaccine injured but still supports them because science says so. What an icon.  
I commend your positive attitude towards vaccines. The fact that you are still in favor of vaccines even though they caused you to be permanently ill is quite astonishing. Thank you so much for being strong and facing your adversities headstrong instead of clinging onto the hate towards vaccines.  
I'm 1/ 1mil also. Don't have GBS though. I did scare the nurse and my girlfriend at that time. Recieved 3 epi shots before I recovered.      If your 1/1mil and I'm 1/1mil does that = 2/2mil?  
Oof I‚Äôm allergic to basically everything about getting them, sterilization stuff check, lasted gloves check, the real fucking vaccine? Half the time yeah. This is because I have Massed Cell though  
I was diagnosed with the chronic form of Guillian Barre, CIDP. Apparently it's extremely rare for it to lt to last this long so it's cool to see another unicorn in the wild. Thank god for IVIG's!  
Oh shit. I‚Äôve been recovering from GBS for almost 5 years now. Messed up my hands pretty good, and I‚Äôm still working on trying to walk again In my case, I‚Äôm not sure what happened. I think it had  two or three years since I last had the flu vaccine Kind of surprised that people didn‚Äôt latch onto this one. I‚Äôm still pro vaccine, but I wouldn‚Äôt wish this upon anyone, I came really close to dying, And it‚Äôs turned my whole world upside down Sorry that happened to you. It‚Äôs crazy how you can just live your life and three days later everything has gone to shit  
Cum?  
You are a hero. If I were wearing your shoes I doubt I would still be a pro-vax. What.a.legend. Hoping life treats you well however it can!  
You‚Äôre not alone. I had the same thing happen to me and I got CIDP. I wish you the best on your journey  
I have had the same problem with a booster shot at age 4 and additionaly pro Vax as well as I now know the problems with not vaxanating your kids as it not only put your kid at risk but people like you and me. Any ways, can you get other shots? Like the shots you get to numb yourself during surgery?  
Who do you work for?  
I‚Äôm so sorry you had to be that ‚Äúone‚Äù, but I commend your continued support. Admirable.  
I'm glad you're able to talk about and be accepted on reddit. I'm also pro vaxx and injured from the Gardasil vaccine, and every time I've tried bringing it up on reddit I've been shut down. We need more awareness, our stories are valid and real.  
Takes a lot of guts to be the sacrificial lamb, you're a good person OP  
You're the reason why anti vaxers are so dangerous, not everyone is able to get vaccinated. A very small percentage, like your bad reacion, or otherwise weak immune systems arent able to take it. People like you need herd mentality, because when anti vaxers start getting infected, guess who is unable to fight the disease?  
My mom is a doctor and my wife is a nurse so we appreciate your support for vaccines.  On a side note I have cerebral palsy from birth. You can get bad shit without vaccines it's just the luck of the draw.  
Wow. Thank you for actively promoting vaccines after what you go through. Unfortunately I can only send you an internet hug and high five but please take as many as you want. You are a hero :)  
Given your experience with vaccines, your speaking out in favor of vaccines is helping hundreds, or thousands, of immunocompromised children live a happy and healthy life.  And that is heroic.  You may not feel like a hero - but you are.  
I've cared for two folks with GBS.  Both were pro-vax.   The truth is you can get it just as easily from the actual virus.  Glad you are being an advocate.  
My dad had this happen to him a while back from flu shot. Crazy. I am pro vaccine as well. My dad did recover but it took a long long time. I believe in you  
It makes me happy to see you wise enough to take the long view. If you can't get vaccinations anymore you need herd immunity to protect you.  
What are the odds?  Sounds like an amazing love story, so good that I can imagine some some doubting it is true.  Did you never exchange pictures in the past or added each other on social media? Where you surprised what she looks like? How old are you guys? Did her moving to Denver had anything to do with you?  
the odds were immeasurably small, and sometimes i wake up wondering if the whole thing was a dream. we had never exchanged pictures, and we also didn‚Äôt really use social media, and we both liked the idea of just writing and talking without seeing our faces irl. we are now both 24, and she came to Denver to pursue her ambitions, but i guess my presence might have played a small part.  
Take the population of Denver, the population of the country, the population of her home town, the gross emigration from there and the gross immigration to Denver... I don‚Äôt know but someone could do the math.  
she had many cities in mind, but i guess my presence gave Denver the edge, so the odds weren‚Äôt that bad.  
You being there was the deciding factor but she didn't tell you when she moved? She never asked you about moving or getting an apartment or job but then somehow gets a job in the exact place you work? Wow!  
Thanks for the reply! I wish you guys all the best  
thank you :)  
Odds are overrated. Love will find a way. Well done to both of you.  
I was going to say 24, but didn‚Äôt see this until just now since I‚Äôm always doing something. It‚Äôs a matter of logic. 9 year olds doing pen-pal letters to other 9 year olds. After 10 years of writing letters, switched to email in 2014. So that‚Äôs 19 in 2014, and we‚Äôre towards the very end of 2019.  19+5=24. We can also say that if after 10 years of writing you switched to email in 2014, you started writing in 2004. 9 years prior to ‚Äò04 would be 1995. I don‚Äôt mean to sound like a stalker-y person by all of this. I get caught up in whatever the topic is and so I tend to pay more attention to details and make more ‚Äúout-of-the-box‚Äù deductions than someone would normally take the time to do so because society norms say that people don‚Äôt want to read walls of text or take the time to have a version of phone tag that involves even more walls of text. People live in a world where 140 character maximums are sufficient to get their points across. I don‚Äôt.  
Well I can make it easier for you.  He stated they started writing at 9 and the title said he met his pen pal of 15 years as his work colleague. (And only worked together for a few months)  15+9= 24.  I wasn‚Äôt paying a lot attention when reading as I was caught up in live, navigating through a city being distracted. I think anyone who wanted to find out what age they are could have done that quite easily and make the correct deductions if paying attention to the text.

Younger people are actually not using Facebook as much. Heck, us older people are catching onto their scummy ways and quitting it in droves. I myself go on like every 2-4 weeks now.  
By my own calculation, the chance of moving in the same city as yours reaches 1 in 500. Since the small businesses in denver is 11000, the chance is: 1 in 5.5 Million  
It's probably a lot closer to 1 in 500 than 1 in 5.5 million. If they've been pen pals all this time, it's likely they share similar interests and would seek similar job opportunities. Still unlikely and very cool tho  
r/theydidthemath  
which is a 0.00000018 chance btw  
You must now marry!  
What was the spirit and essence of these letters and emails that kept the pen friendship going for so long?  
we were both introverts, and thus writing was a way both of us could freely express ourselves.  i was motivated to keep writing as her personality was just great, she was funny and confident, and we both could share our personal problems, and just talk about life.  honestly, the 15 years and nearly 1000 letters and emails passed so quickly, and i‚Äôm just so glad i participated in that program in the first place.  
That's amazing. I hope these writings are kept and you could some way memorialise and share some key milestones at your wedding or life events. Cheers.  
i think a wedding is jumping the gun a bit, but we both still have 99% of our letters and all of our emails. i think 3-4 letters have been damaged and i remember that i split water on one of them.  
Is that code for you‚Äôre gonna break up with her?  
What are the odds: maybe there are none, maybe she moved there on purpose and found a job there on purpose and didn‚Äôt tell you she moved to Denver on purpose too... because you are the purpose...  Think about it...  
i wish that was the case. she mainly came to Denver as she wanted to pursue her career her, but i like to think that i played at least a little part in her decision.  
No one just ups and moves to Denver. What career is in Denver that has a lot of choices in her field and offers a lot of room for advancement? I still doubt any of this is real. At 19 you two would have been texting, heck at 16 you would have been texting.  
Not too sure about the texting. Since 10 years I‚Äôm in contact with a french guy, we only write through Facebook; it‚Äôs like a pen pal.  We met two years ago and still only wrote Facebook messages and never text; the only exception was the Time I deleted myself from FB for several years so we switched to email and we occasionally exchange letters. It‚Äôs just a different medium than texting  Not saying this story is necessarily true, just wanted to give my input about the texting / emailing  
I agree. I have a penpal from Ireland and we only use email. He came to Huntington Beach (where I used to live) and didn't even tell me. He said it was only for a few hours. So, he didnt want to impose on me. Also, he is quite shy and has social anxiety. So, I am sure all of this also helped with him not reaching out when he came to California for holiday.  
I have at least 10 friends from college who decided to up and move to Denver when we graduated because it‚Äôs an amazing city that‚Äôs got a ton of culture and outdoor activities. I do not find that strange at all. This was 11 years ago and they have all stayed and pursued their careers there.  
Just ignore them, they're probably from LA and are the type that cant imagine why anyone would want to live anywhere other than LA.  
Moving to Denver isn't strange. Jane not telling the OP she was moving to Denver is, well, unbelievable.  If I'm moving to a new city, I'm definitely going to contact anyone I know there first, for advice, etc.  
I agree I upped and moved to Colorado Springs in Feb of this year I love it, and when this lease is up im making the jump to Denver.  
Are you attracted to Jane?  
i always had sort of a crush on her, but i only started to have romantic feelings for her after meeting her  
Do you feel she might also have feelings for you? Is she single? Are you planning to take your relationship to the next step (start dating)?  
we have actually dated for 2 months now, and it has been amazing so far. i have never had so much fun working at a restaurant before.  i now look forward to meeting her everyday :)  
Awesome! Does she feel the same?  
Just wanna say, this made the start of my weekend a little bit brighter.   Please make sure to host an AMA whenever the relationship takes the next step(either off a cliff, or down the aisle).   We'll be here to either support you, or offer comfort.  
thank you so much my man, i will be sure to do it  
I just wanna tell you that you made my day way better now  
and your comment melted my heart :)  
 What was your first impression of her in that coffee store when you still didn't know that it was infact your penpal you were looking at. You say she told you it was infact her in an E-Mail. Did she know that it was you from the mail you wrote or did she get the hint sooner?   
1, honestly, i didn‚Äôt pay much attention and she was busy calling someone, my first actual confrontation the next day was awkward to say the least. we just stood and looked at each other for what must have been 5 minutes.  after reading my email, she quickly sent one back asking if it was <insert restaurant name>, as she realised that her new co worker shared the same name as i. after around 2 emails later, we realised that we actually met each other in person.   
Sounds like she hunted your ass down  
sounds like a horror movie  
Cant wait to hear how it ends  
The letter is coming from INSIDE THE HOUSE  
where u suprised by how she looked?  
surprisingly, she looked similar to what imagined her to be but i was still surprised as she was more beautiful than i expected her to be. she was truly pretty on the inside and the outside :)  
Aww, that‚Äôs sweet  
She definitely came to your workplace on purpose.  
technically she was employed a few hours before me, so i came to her workplace :)  
Add this detail to the main post! It makes the whole thing seem like stalker-ish and helps highlight how low the odds of this happening are!  
That makes the story less believable.  I could see if she totally stalked you and planned this but for you to get a job where she was first employed seals the deal for me that this is all made up  
Aww thats beautiful then  
I'm contacting Disney now and optioning the rights to the movie  
Mum said I could have the rights  
Mum said it's my turn with the rights.  
Don't you guys remember she said it was MY turn to the rights?  
you guys can share :)  
No fair, you had it too long last time!  
Ight imma send you a frog  
Hallmark has made this already I'm sure, but it won't stop them from making it again, sell it to them!  
I'm doing the soundtrack and score  
Hows the decade been  
it‚Äôs been full of ups and downs, but we have always wrote to each other and consoled each other when stuff went wrong. i basically lived my conscious life with her, and we shared everything with each other. so the decade has been like a normal decade, but with a close friend that always stuck to me.  
I think it‚Äôs odd that the person you confided in so deeply and shared so many personal things with... didn‚Äôt tell you she was moving to your city. That would have happened the first moment a potential move even became a consideration, including employment and living recommendations. I want to believe, OP; help me in my unbelief.  
i do agree that i phrased it a little bit odd, but she tried to keep it a surprise, and thus didn‚Äôt tell me about moving to Denver until i asked. not to mention, she did tell me that she was planning to move to another city, but deliberately left the city unnamed, as she didn‚Äôt want to ruin the surprise.  
And then working at your place of work...was a coincidence?  Waiting for you to bring it up and surprise you? Stalking? It‚Äôs still confusing to me.  
she didn‚Äôt know i was working there, it was a coincidence  
Are we invited to the wedding?  
for sure :)  
I feel like it would be so cute to compile lines from all your letters to each other to create a master letter that you‚Äôll propose to her with. Then again idk how that would flow but like, it sounds cute üòÇ  
we need a Reddit wedding!!!  
Also, could you clarify who's "we"  
You and me bro of course - you think I'd forget you?  
No I will not fall for this trap You're just trying to get me to come as your +1  
Someone's gotta pay for these tuxedos - "I got you next time"  
Not without a date  
Idea:  wedding date should be the date of the first letter sent.  
I hope y‚Äôall get married. This is cute as fuck  
It would suck if they didn't. I mean, what a great story to tell about how you met. Imagine them not working out, then the one he marries is someone he met on Grindr.  
thank you :)  
what an amazing love story that could be made into a movie  
thank you :)  
How did you two manage to know so little about one another despite all of this communication?  
we knew quite a lot about each other, just not the information that could be used against us if the other was a predator. for example, we didn‚Äôt name our schools and our families. also, we liked to focus on our personalities rather than our personal information. we know each other very well in that regard.  
Amazing story!  Did you guys keep your letters?  
we kept all the letters that weren‚Äôt damaged. we did damage a few, like spilling water on them, but we kept all the rest. for the emails, we used the same account since we started, and i have archived all of them on a hard drive.  
Glad to hear it!! Something to show the kids :)  
Awh! This is a story you'll tell your grandchildren!  
the best part is that we kept a nice record of all the dumb things we did since we were 9 :)  
Why do you think you have a "polluted mind"  
honestly, i just wrote it as a username.  
No backstory for this one huh  
You just told me everything I wanted to know. Great for both of you.  
You can say that you just wrote your own love story;)  
Did you never exchanged numbers and started texting? Do you plan to do that? Do you think this will change the way you communicate (texting vs letter/email writing)? Do you intend to keep the tradition and write each other letters?  
we both shared a dislike for texting, and we also liked the feeling of being able to spend an hour or two crafting a perfect email or letter and sending it to the other person.  unfortunately, we now no longer do it on a weekly basis, but we still do it when we are apart. for example, she had to visit her family back in New Orleans a month ago, and we went right back to emailing again.  
That sounds amazing my dude! Wish you both the best in your future!  
same for you my man :)  
This is so wholesome and congrats! üòÉ How is the dating going thus far? Does it help that you already know eachother?  
it has been fantastic, and knowing everything about each other since we were 9 really helped in our relationship. she‚Äôs certainly the love of my life.  
Omg I'm literally waiting to get on a flight at DIA right now, it's so weird to think that this is happening so close to me, I don't really have any questions but, I wish you both good luck with your lives!  
anything could happen, wish you the best of luck my guy :)  
What a lovely story! Was there any awkwardness between you the next time you met each other in person after discovering the truth?  
certainly.  there was roughly a minute of staring, and we didn‚Äôt say much. it was awkward at first, just like meeting anyone for the first time, but after a few days, we were like inseparable best friends, and after a few months, we started dating :)  
How offen did you write to each other?  Do you think she moved to Denver because of you?  Did you expect her to look different to how she looks? Really cute love story hope you guys have a happy life together :)  
we wrote once a week, but sometimes more if we were free. i guess i was a small reason in why she moved, but i think the main reason was that she wanted to pursue a career in Denver.  i didn‚Äôt really know what to expect, but she looked really stunning, and i‚Äôm glad i met her :)  
I married my pen pal 25 years ago in March !!  
"... rapid fan of the nuggets". I fully appreciate this play on words with Colorado sports teams. Lol  
Are you both studying? You mentioned she moved to further her career - what is the career she is pursuing?  
i was studying for a business degree in MSU Denver finishing this year, and she finished her degree in Finance this year as well.  she seeks to be a finance officer in a reputable company.  
[deleted]  
Wow that's a really cool story, are you guys only friends or are is there some romantic chemistry going on? If there is, this could easily become a cheesy hollywood movie hahaha  
we actually have been dating for 2 months now, and it has been the best 2 months of my life :)  
Congratulations! I wish I could have a love story like that lol  
How did you figure it out and what did you do after you found out  
Seems unlikely that the letters and emails stayed completely platonic after all those years of intimate communication. There had to have been at least a few letters like "I just can't talk to anybody here the way I do with you. I wish we lived in the same place, etc." Especially through those awkward high school years that are especially tough for introverts. Surely there had to be some hinting at romance in all the letters over the years?  
Why do you think she didn't tell you she was moving to your city beforehand?  
well, she wanted it to be a sort of surprise.  however, she did mention wanting to move to Denver before to pursue her career, but i didn‚Äôt expect it so soon.  
Are you sure it‚Äôs her?  
that sounds like it has the potential of a horror thriller. but jokes aside, i‚Äôm sure :)  
Did she know you lived in Denver in the first place? I suspect she did... why didn‚Äôt she tell you off hand? I‚Äôm sure the move was planned before hand, moreover, she might had chooses Denver because of you subliminally. Either way incredible story! Best of luck.  
when it got to the ‚Äòwe are now dating‚Äô part i screamed  
This is the cutest thing I've read all week! I wish you two the best!  
Where around New Orleans is she from (greetings from NOLA!) Most people just say they‚Äôre from New Orleans if they are anywhere near the metro area! Also, how does she like Denver? That‚Äôs a far stretch from home!  
[deleted]  
You just need to take a trip down here then! The food is something else.  
Wouldn‚Äôt you have known that in sending her mail every week?  
Since you‚Äôve met each other and have started dating are the letters becoming more infrequent? I hope not. You should keep writing them. It sounds like a very healthy form of communication in a relationship.  
we do still rarely text, but now we love face to face communication. we do still email when there‚Äôs a long story though, or sometimes just for fun. the frequency has dropped unfortunately, now about once every two weeks or so.  
Dark twist she's a stalker! But seriously that's insane !!  
that‚Äôs some next level horror thriller script, will update here if it happens :)  
So, when‚Äôs the wedding?  
i think getting married is still not in our foreseeable future, but things have been going great so far :)  
Are things going in a romantic or physical way?  That‚Äôs be good.  
How did your family/friends respond when you told them about this?  
they were generally quite supportive, and some were amazed  
I don‚Äôt know man, with Denver rent is so high right now y‚Äôall might as well move in together... keep us updated  
Can you guys start an Instagram or YouTube channel? I know you‚Äôre both introverts but I‚Äôm sure lots of people would love to hear your story.  
Have you ever considered you might just be a character in a y/a novel? Because that would make a hell of a lot more sense!  
Are you dating ?  
Wow I have no questions. Im just surprised somebody's favourite team is the nuggets. Good for you two though! Happy holidays!  
Thank you for posting this. I was feeling a little sad today so it was nice reading your heartwarming story before I go to bed.  Wish you the best!  
Wait.  You found that you worked with a person with a VERY common name - and you found that to be such a "hilarious coincidence" that you mentioned this to someone else named Jane? That sounds pretty fishy. And you were sending snail mail starting in 2004 - and continuing through 2014 before someone thought about using email? Nope. And you expect people to believe that you and Jane are 24 year old friends who are as close as you could be with someone you hadn't met - and you never connected on social media?  Never shared a photo? Not even remotely credible. OP, I'm not sure why you're lying about this - but you are.  I can't imagine what people to fabricate this sort of thing are thinking.  You are a person - and you matter - you don't need to make up silly shit to get people to pay attention to you.  Stop it. Edit: Having now thought about this for a couple minutes - there are other issues.: - 9 year olds who sign up for a pen pal are typically matched with children of the same sex.  This is primarily done so they tend to have more to connect about, but it's also a security matter. - I find it hard to imagine a boy and a girl who pass from childhood, through the teenage years and into adulthood, who connect and maintain that connection in the way you described.  It's not impossible, to be sure, but with everything else together it further suggests that you're lying. - Also, unless you're transgender, it would be very odd for anyone to describe their gender in the past tense.  That's a very odd thing which further suggests that you're not being honest. - And, surprise, it's a brand new account.   I note that multiple redditors have commented that this is such a sweet story.  I guess there are gullible people everywhere you go.  I'm 100% convinced that it's fake - but fake stories can still be sweet.  This isn't that either.  It reads like the work of a 14 year old who's seen too many Harlequin romance movies.  
I agree, except your first point is incorrect- her name isn't actually Jane, it might not even be a common name. She could be named Moniqua for all we know. Jane is a persona in this story. Also, my roommate is 24 and has never made a social media account, not one. In 2019, he still surfs imgur and ifunny, without an account. So I'm not too shocked to hear about two people who didn't connect online other than email. It's rare, but not impossible.  That being said, this still sounds 99% too good to be true, and I cannot believe that she just wouldn't mention moving to his city, or that in a city the size of Denver, she just happened to apply to the same restaurant he did, and they both got hired. The odds are too great for me.  
To the OP. I want to believe you as it‚Äôs such a great story. The only way to prove this guy wrong is to take a pic of all your letters saved over the years (write your username on a piece of paper and include it in your pic) and post it  
I noticed you didn‚Äôt ask the OP a question so I will do so:  ‚ÄúOP, after having read this comment, who will be rushing you to the burn unit?‚Äù  
So cute....  
Sounds like the seed of a good romcom.  
Wow the best part was you staying that the chicken nuggies are trying to outlast the birds Well.....  
Marry her  
That is fucking amazing, reading that story put a smile on my face and made the beginning of my day a bright one, good luck to both of you, and I hope you both are happy and well. Anyway I'll ask my question since that's what the sub is about lol. What was it like when you first met her irl under those crazy odds, and how did you feel when everything lined up so perfectly like that?  
This seems so serendipitous. I wish the moon and the stars for you two.  
A great story! Thank you for sharing.  
This sounds like a fan-fic tbh üòÇ

Where you surprised what she looks like? How old are you guys? Did her moving to Denver had anything to do with you? the odds were immeasurably small, and sometimes i wake up wondering if the whole thing was a dream.  we had never exchanged pictures, and we also didn‚Äôt really use social media, and we both liked the idea of just writing and talking without seeing our faces irl.  we are now both 24, and she came to Denver to pursue her ambitions, but i guess my presence might have played a small part. Here   what an amazing love story that could be made into a movie thank you :) Here   What was the spirit and essence of these letters and emails that kept the pen friendship going for so long? we were both introverts, and thus writing was a way both of us could freely express ourselves.  i was motivated to keep writing as her personality was just great, she was funny and confident, and we both could share our personal problems, and just talk about life.  honestly, the 15 years and nearly 1000 letters and emails passed so quickly, and i‚Äôm just so glad i participated in that program in the first place. Here   Congratulations this should be made into a movie thank you :) Here   What are the odds: maybe there are none, maybe she moved there on purpose and found a job there on purpose and didn‚Äôt tell you she moved to Denver on purpose too... because you are the purpose...   Think about it... i wish that was the case. she mainly came to Denver as she wanted to pursue her career her, but i like to think that i played at least a little part in her decision. Here   where u suprised by how she looked? surprisingly, she looked similar to what imagined her to be but i was still surprised as she was more beautiful than i expected her to be.  she was truly pretty on the inside and the outside :) Here   1. What was your first impression of her in that coffee store when you still didn't know that it was infact your penpal you were looking at.  2. You say she told you it was infact her in an E-Mail. Did she know that it was you from the mail you wrote or did she get the hint sooner? 1, honestly, i didn‚Äôt pay much attention and she was busy calling someone, my first actual confrontation the next day was awkward to say the least. we just stood and looked at each other for what must have been 5 minutes.  2. after reading my email, she quickly sent one back asking if it was <insert restaurant name>, as she realised that her new co worker shared the same name as i. after around 2 emails later, we realised that we actually met each other in person. Here   Did you never exchanged numbers and started texting? Do you plan to do that? Do you think this will change the way you communicate (texting vs letter/email writing)? Do you intend to keep the tradition and write each other letters? we both shared a dislike for texting, and we also liked the feeling of being able to spend an hour or two crafting a perfect email or letter and sending it to the other person.  unfortunately, we now no longer do it on a weekly basis, but we still do it when we are apart. for example, she had to visit her family back in New Orleans a month ago, and we went right back to emailing again. Here   You just told me everything I wanted to know. Great for both of you. thanks :) Here   Hows the decade been it‚Äôs been full of ups and downs, but we have always wrote to each other and consoled each other when stuff went wrong. i basically lived my conscious life with her, and we shared everything with each other.  so the decade has been like a normal decade, but with a close friend that always stuck to me. Here   Amazing story! Did you guys keep your letters? we kept all the letters that weren‚Äôt damaged. we did damage a few, like spilling water on them, but we kept all the rest.  for the emails, we used the same account since we started, and i have archived all of them on a hard drive. Here   That sounds amazing my dude! Wish you both the best in your future! same for you my man :) Here   So, when‚Äôs the wedding? i think getting married is still not in our foreseeable future, but things have been going great so far :) Here   Are you attracted to Jane? i always had sort of a crush on her, but i only started to have romantic feelings for her after meeting her Here   So cute.... thank you :) Here    Source  
This is just the sweetest!  Good luck to you both!  
I live in Denver and I was at that same game.  
It‚Äôs sweet and all but can we get some proof? Can you photograph some of your older letters? I want to believe but it just sounds too serendipitous to be true  
[deleted]  
How are you doing today.  
What was the first unexpected thing you discovered about her after meeting her in person?  
Okay so you guys started dating AFTER she moved to Denver? Whew! That‚Äôs a lucky break. Everyone knows in Denver that people who move to Denver together or for another person never stay together. Don‚Äôt let her be tempted by the wooks and fancy mustaches!  
How are you today?  
[deleted]  
Did your writing improve because you wrote letters regularly?  
Reading such stories makes me  feel so happy and I am very happy for you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è  
I have no questions but merely want to say that is a very cool story!  Best of luck to you both!  
I was a male? holup  
now I'm curious  
I just cant unsee it now  
I'm confused by this as well. Bad grammar or what...  
How did you find out?  
[deleted]  
Sell the rights to this story. Could profit off this shit bro haha  
Awww, that is so cute. I really hope it works out for you two!  
So a girl you‚Äôve been writing letters to for a decade and a half moved to the same city as you and failed to tell you until she already got a job? Alright buddy. Not only applied for a got a job but management had time to let employees know.  
There arent enough stories like this in the world we live in. It really brings me happiness knowing this can happen.   I wish you both good luck with the rest your lives.  
I wouldn‚Äôt even want to look into it were I you. Only because who cares if she moved to be closer to you, you guys are obviously great for each other. And you get to experience the joy of being with your first love. Most of us end up loosing our first love and we never forget them, even if we no longer are attracted to them we will always remember them. So just enjoy and be happy together, enjoy the serendipities that life has give you my friend.  
This is what i call fate

Sorry, this isn't related but is their a subreddit where I can read interesting personal stories like this?  
Woo nuggets  
Where you surprised by what she looks like? Where she surprised by how you look like? Will you consider yourself attractive looking? Is she attractive looking? Are you both planning on keep on dating and maybe marry someday? How did your parents respond? Are you feeling different to each other since you met?  
Probably one of the random wholesome story I've read on internet  
Why did you want to die? What made you change your mind?  
I was really struggling with depression. This was partially due to my body image, i was 6ft 3 and 70kg (now 93kg).  i had really struggled with my mum going through breast cancer as i didn't speak to anyone about it and bottled it all up. I was ashamed with how i handled visiting her in the hospital and should have seen her more often. A week before i was going to kill myself someone i was friends with jumped in front of a train, killing himself. I saw the effect his death had on the people around me, people who he didnt think care about him we distraught and i saw how devastated his family was. I remember breaking down a couple nights later after the shock had worn off and promised myself i would never put my friends and family through that  
Man, I'm so sorry to hear that about your friend. That's gotta be kind of tough to reconcile that he is the reason you're still here today. You made a good decision to keep fighting and stay  
I think about him often, i wasn't a really close friend but i new his parents well and had known him for years. i was also the last person, aside from his parents, to see him alive. I wish i could have said something to him but i was angry as he had just lied to everyone about his dad having cancer  
did you ever find out why he did it?  any note or anything? hey man, good your doing better! feel free to pm to vent if needed  
That's good advice u/PM-boobs-and-i-rate  
Wow. Im proud of you :D  
Thankyou!! it means a lot  
I‚Äôm proud of you too  
im sorry for ur friend man...i lost my friend who jumped off a building....:( its crazy to phantom it sometimes but yea....i hope u get what u want and i wish u all the best for the foreseeable future. Thank you for living man, really i may not know u but u made the right decision. :)  
Thankyou, i really appreciate that.  
Care for oneself extends to others. I‚Äôm sure this post alone is helping people. Much love!  
Wait, that means you were really skinny? I am really skinny, and like 1/2 of my class always talks bad things behind my back about how i am a ‚Äúcripple‚Äù or something like that, btw i am     158 cm (5,25ft) 40 kg wich is real fucking skinny. And i say this bc i want to know if you were bullied or something like that. Btw congrats!  
I was never really bullied which made it worse because i thought they aren't making comments about how skinny i am to be mean, theyre saying these things because this is what they honestly think. It was more wherever i went people would pick up on it and make a comment. Now wherever i go people will sometimes comment on how big i am so it's a complete role change ahha  
"Survivor's guilt"; I can relate. I always thought that "Somehow I could have done more, seen it earlier, etc etc" Well done for working through it.  
Thank you for sharing this. I'm currently in a similar place to where you were, but trying to seek help so I don't hurt my friends and family. How did you move forward after deciding to live?  
So i really just started analysing myself. At the end of the day i would i write down what made me happy today. Anything small, like singing in the shower or working out. I would then make a list of anything that lowered my mood throughout the day. I would then make sure i did the things that made me happy and avoided the things that i didn‚Äôt like. I would also write down what i didn‚Äôt like about myself but only specific things. things that i could work towards and change about myself. I now know how to make myself happy when i'm sad, how to motivate myself and how to improve myself.  
How do you motivate yourself? And how do you improve yourself ? I‚Äôm kinda in a dark place right now after a break up and I really want to work out because I consider myself too thin but I cannot get the motivation.  
i Originally would listen to motivational speeches and talks but found that it was only temporary. Instead i would write my own motivational messages to myself for when i was down. i found this a lot more effective One of the things i had written in my notes in 2017. "One day i was looking for something to motivate me. Looking for a person to inspire me. But the thing is, that person isn't going to be there for you every time you're down. The only person who's going to be around you i you. So you need to learn to motivate yourself, Inspire yourself...." When you want to improve yourself it's too overwhelming. You need to break it down into smaller pieces. One of the most motivating things is seeing improvement. So make your goals easier to begin with, start the ball rolling and then keep the momentum. I started to write down what i want to improve about myself, only things that are realistic. I originally had 4 categories that i wanted to improve. My organisation, mentally relaxing, being physically active and hygiene. In each category i would have 3 items. Each goal was something that i could change about myself overnight, e.g. washing my face, listening to a podcast, updating a calendar. I would then have 4 don'ts. These were 4 things that i need to stop doing or reduce.  Hopefully that's clear but feel free to pm me and i can explain in more detail and help you make you own goals  
That's fantastic. You should be very proud.  
I've been there too. I can't tell you how you're going to get through this, but I promise you, you can. I literally stood at a point in the road where I could go one way, towards home, family and my GP, or in the other direction to walk in front of a train. From that moment, for months, everything moved so slowly. The world crawled to a halt.  It took such a long time to speed up again, but 8 years later I have a mortgage, a slightly shitty job I enjoy and a wonderful, 3 year old boy. Sometimes the world still turns slowly and I struggle, but I've never fallen that far again. Your GP should be your first call. Meds can save your life. You are worth fighting for xxxx  
I am genuinely considering suicide right now. I‚Äôve recently been doing riskier things and living on the edge knowing that if anything happens I‚Äôd be fine with it. AP scores are released tomorrow and I checked early and I didn‚Äôt get above a 2 on any of my 4 exams. In our culture failure isn‚Äôt taken well. I‚Äôm so scared for the disappointment she‚Äôd express and she‚Äôs been getting mad at me recently and criticizing me for everything. I want to do it but I know I shouldn‚Äôt. Just wanted to vent there‚Äôs no question  
Firstly, I took AP tests too, and by holy fucking Christ it was a shitshow.  The fact that you took four of those fucked up exams is something to be proud of, passing or not, regardless of what she thinks. You know how hard it was. You know the toll it took on you. If nobody else is, I am proud of you. I'm extremely fucking proud of you. And if it makes you feel better, this year's scores are likely not going to be held against us, so I wouldn't fret.  What I need you to know is that life changes. Life changes man. Life has changed alot, is changing alot right now, and it's going to be changing alot in the future. You won't be in the same position you're in right now in a year or two. Change is going to happen. You're going to graduate. Your going to move out. You're going to meet someone you're going to want to spend your life with.  Life is a shitshow right now man. It just is. Its fucking horrible. Theres so many reasons to just give up and not enough to stay.  You're going through the darkest part of the tunnel. You're in the pits of it. It just seems like it goes on forever. You just dont even care about anything anymore. Not even yourself. So you're taking these risks. She is feeling it too. The stress. She's going through shit as well. She's taking some of it out on you, and probably doesn't even know it.  I guess the only thing I can say is life will change. Its gonna change. You're going to look back on this part of your life and see how far you've come. I cant tell you when, but you will. Life will change. Because that's what it does. For better and for worse, highs and lows. Give your life a chance to change. I promise its going to be so worth it.  
u/C0MM4ND3R_C0D31N3 I cant say it any better than this. Do not be afraid to reach out. You are more important that any test score. We are proud of you no matter what anyone else says.  
Man I'd give an award if I had any, but know that my upvote comes from the heart. I doubt anyone could have said it better then that.  
This really means a lot to me. I don‚Äôt know how to show my gratitude to everyone who has responded to me and cared about what I had to say because it feels nice having people care. Thank you so much. I really mean it  
Reddit has your back friend. Dont you ever doubt it. There's always ears willing to hear you, even if you can't acknowledge them.  
There's help out there. Try not to vent where you might not be heard as you'll feel more alone. People care about you more than any exam score.  
Please remember that your test scores don‚Äôt determine your worth. You are worth everything. You are worth the ground you walk on, the air you breathe, the family that loves you. Pass or fail, these test scores are not the end all be all. There is so much more to come in life and you will succeed at whatever you want to. Please know that there are people who care about you and care to see your success. Even this random person that‚Äôs never met you. You matter.  
I took 6 AP exams in high school and scored a 2 or lower on every single one. I basically wasted $500+ on exams I failed. I just graduated college and guess what those AP exams barely would‚Äôve made a difference in my life if I passed. Those AP exams would cover your first semester (maybe second) of gen ed classes and that‚Äôs it. You‚Äôd maybe be half a semester ahead if you passed. Now you can just take the classes in person and knock them out of the park (and they‚Äôll likely be a lot easier than the exams). I‚Äôm grateful I took my beginner ‚Äúeasy‚Äù college courses my freshman year because it let me ease into college and prepared me for my harder courses down the line. Don‚Äôt let a standardized test that relies on your memory more than your intelligence take away your life and all of the positive experiences you haven‚Äôt had yet.  
Suicide hot line number is 1-800-273-8255 please, reach out and seek help. You are loved, you are valued, and I‚Äôm thankful for your existence. I know things are hard right now but it will get better. You‚Äôre in a valley right now but keep going and you‚Äôll reach that mountain top. I know it seems hard now but please keep going. There are people in this world who love you and are glad you are here and I‚Äôm one of them‚ù§Ô∏è  
Sounds like you don‚Äôt wanna die you just don‚Äôt wanna live the life you‚Äôre living right now. You can always start fresh  
Please don‚Äôt. Please. I can‚Äôt respond to you if you‚Äôre gone. I want to communicate with you. Message me.  
hey man, try to hang in there... maybe have a sit down talk with some family and tell them what is going on...     if you need to vent or someone to hold you accountable in a helpful way, i can try to help. things can get better!  
Man hang in there, I read a quote in here that says ‚Äúif you are going through a tough time, keep going!‚Äù  
I know this is 5 days old but I want to add that I am extremely fluent in French and have been mistaken in conversation for French in France. I did the French AP and I got a 2. Moral of the story. Exams are meaningless. Ignore your parents. Learn for the joy of it. Americans don't know shit about French.  
You‚Äôre doing your best and that‚Äôs all that matters. We‚Äôre all proud of you, and the people that aren‚Äôt shouldn‚Äôt matter to you! Keep your head up and you‚Äôll get to wherever you want to be!  
congrats man! sadly my friend commited suicide February of this year, i failed to be a friend one last time... one question tho how wud u handle someone who is suicidal? what is the best advice u have to give?  
It's hard i think to get through to someone who is suicidal. I think the best thing to do is help them see how things can get better and that there is light at the end of the tunnel. Since my experience, i have studied psychology and learned a lot about mental illness. Understanding that you aren't well and what you're experiencing is common in a lot of people, but you can be cured is invaluable. I've also spoken to a lot of people who are suicidal by reaching out to them on reddit and other social media and a lot of people find comfort in knowing you care about them. It may seem obvious that people care about them but when you're in that state you can be in your house with a loving family or surrounded by friends and still feel alone, with nobody to care for you.  
No question, I just want to say congratulations :)  
Thankyou!!  
[removed]  
Thankyou, i appreciate it  
Ya welcome, keep up the great work  
no question either just wanna say congratulations  
Came here to say the same. Congratulations and I wish you nothing but peace moving forward!  
Why didn't you? What stopped you from the moment you finished planning to the moment you decided not to?  
Someone i was friends with committed suicide a couple days before. I saw the effect it had on everyone around me and how badly it hurt everyone. I didn't realised how badly i would have hurt the people around me, it was an eye opener and showed how much everyone really does care about you, even if it's not clear  
good for you! stay strong!  
Thankyou!!  
Do you put ketchup on the side or on top when you eat fries  
Side. i like to choose how much ketchup each chip gets. Like the crunchy burnt ones don't really need it  
Good choice my man  
Asking the important question  
Today is 17 days for me. I was really close. I had the gun on my coffee table and I was laying on the couch thinking and sobbing and getting ready... and then my cat jumped on me and I kind of snapped out of it. The past two months has been hard. I stopped taking my antidepressants and I pretty much lost it. Everything was just too overwhelming, it got to be too much. My boss pulled me into the office  two days after my near attempt, and long story short I just broke down and told him everything. He helped me get a doctor, I‚Äôm back on medication and I‚Äôm so thankful for the people I work with for being so understanding. And for my cat being the sweet love bug she is. My dad committed suicide when I was younger, and I always swore I could never do that to my family but I get it now. Sometimes it‚Äôs just too much. I just had to get that off my chest. I haven‚Äôt told my boyfriend. I sort of told my mom, but she just thinks I had a break down at work. I don‚Äôt know if I can tell them.  Congrats to you, and to all the others. And stay strong üí™  
I'm sorry to hear you were so low recently - and am so glad you were able to snap out of it. Praise to the kitty!! And it's amazing you were able to get help from your boss like that! That is so rare. Definitely something to be grateful for, and proud of! --You are the kind of person an employer like that wants to hire and keep around, which means you must have a lot going for you :)  Mental illness is such a struggle. I have found that one of the greatest things for defending against my depression is having a vision to hope for and work towards. This post and OP's comments seem great for reminding me of practical things to do daily to try and strengthen and uplift myself. I know I need to change some things in my life in order to avoid what bring me down, and spend time focusing on and developing the things that make me happy. -- So simple, but SO not what I do everyday. Something else that has been on my mind the past couple days that has been helping me is the idea of intentionally thinking of my life as a story being written, for the benefit of my soul eternally. I'm naturally agnostic and have a lot of beef with organized religion, but the truth is -- nobody really knows if there is more to life than what we are currently experiencing, but I have found that it helps to allow myself to carry some form of eternal hope. If you can imagine any scenario where your (eternal) soul is able to take the good the bad and the ugly from this life, and the build upon it in whatever the next life happens to bring, then then perhaps it can lead to finding meaning in your struggles, making enduring them worthwhile? Anyways, sorry for the long comment. I wish you the best moving forward!  
Thank you for the long comment! I also don‚Äôt believe in religion, but it‚Äôs not like I know for sure nothing happens after death so I like that thought.  
Is it weird that I'm jealous? When I attempted no one gave a shit, not even my own parents. I have no one and nothing in this world.  My point is Congrats and look after the ones that are important to you and look out for you in life. They're more important than you realise : )  
Thankyou, and well done to you too! It's real tough but speaking to them is only going to help. The feelings i had towards my friend when he committed suicide were almost anger at times. Why didn‚Äôt he tell me? i could have helped. Look how much your boss helped you and now think how much someone who loves you can help. Keep going and never give in  
This was also me a couple weeks ago. I was actually going to do it until I realized melatonin and sleeping pills aren‚Äôt the same thing. I know, stupid. Nobody knows about it and I wish I could just tell someone and say fuck you I almost killed myself  Thank you for coming to my TedTalk  
No questions, just congrats and best of wishes to you.  
Thankyou, i appreciate it!  
hi thank you for opening up to strangers:) i‚Äôm struggling with a few things myself so : how did you get the motivation to move forward  from such a dark place? in my own experience it took talking to my brother but i feel like i have nobody right now and this made me smile, and have hope in even myself:) thank you so much  
i used to listen to loads of motivational speeches but then i started writing my own. i found that my own voice was so much better for me than hearing the voice of another and i could keep myself motivated. Feel free to PM and i'll share some of the things i've written  
thank you for staying. everyone is glad that you did and i hope youre doing good :)  
Thankyou, i'm doing great!!  
No questions, just congrats, I‚Äôm so happy for you :D  
Thankyou!!  
What do you mean by a better version of yourself u/what-do-you_mean ?  
Ahh yes. Well i write down what i want to improve about myself, only things that are realistic. I originally had 4 categories that i wanted to improve. My organisation, mentally relaxing, being physically active and hygiene. In each category i would have 3 items. Each goal was something that i could change about myself overnight, e.g. washing my face, listening to a podcast, updating a calendar. I would then have 4 don'ts. These were 4 things that i need to stop doing or reduce.  At the end i find i'm a better person, i'm kinder to myself and to others  
This is so useful thank u  
Hey I can relate, planned it on my 25th bday, I'll be 28 this year. I wanna ask, what steps did you take or what influences helped change your perspective of yourself? I love hearing positive outcomes like this  
I would just write down what i liked and what i didn‚Äôt like each day. Any small insignificant thing that made me smile that day i wrote down. The next day i would try and do as many of those things as possible. And on the contrary i would avoid all the things that i didn't like. How many times do you do something a feel shit after and think i always feel like this after x? For me it was a lot. This is where i first really started to take of myself and i learned what i like doing and loved doing those things. I would then look at ways i could improve myself. Things such as hygiene was great for me. It feels good to care for yourself. My confidence also grew immensely through working out. I've put on a lot of muscle and like how i look in the mirror  
That's really good stuff, thanks for sharing. I did t write down positives, maybe I should start that. It would certainly help me I think. Thank you  
That's they key part. you can't go about your day looking for all the things you don't like and trying to avoid them. Write down what you love and go after it.  
First of all, I want to congratulate you. Second, what was wrong with your image? I'm curious because I have literally the same measures  
Partly because i played Rugby i was particularly conscious about my size, i also had been teased a lot about being skinny so my self confidence was really low  
Yeah I've also had problems with being skinny but that's why I started doing weightlifting a couple months ago. Unfortunately, due to corona, it has taken away my drive to lift weights  
I blessed with having some room at home so i've managed to keep up my workouts. All low weights and high reps but it's doing the trick. I‚Äôve been smashing through the preworkout to keep me motivated for home workouts though, but i always feel a lot better after. Are you taking any supplements to help with putting on mass?  
No, I'm not taking any supplements. I'm consuming as much protein as I can tho  
What do you feel is the first step to the road to recovery? What would you say to yourself to really change your mind? How planned out and committed were you to it? Thank you for sharing and I'm glad you have been able to fight past that point in your life. Stay strong and live long  
I think the first step it recognising that you are loved. When my friend committed suicide i saw how much people cared for him. People who you didn‚Äôt think cared, were crying and were in pieces. It made me realise that people care for me just as much as they care about him.  My mind was changed from that point onwards and i knew that i had to change. Depression was like a pit that i had fell into and you fucking stay in it unless you claw and climb your way out. I wasn't trying to get out before. I was pretty committed, i had chosen the day and i knew the place. There's a hill near where i live and it looks over an old flood plane from the ice age. You can see for miles and miles. And from left to right a train runs all the way across. I had planned to sit on one of the bridges above the track and jump off into a train. Who knows if i would have chickened out; but i was pretty set on it at the time.  
No question, just really happy you kept swimming :) üíõ  
What do you love most about this world? Also, congrats big time  
I love the nature, the rivers, the forests the mountains. I never appreciated it before i just took it all for granted. But then you stop and really look at how beautiful it is.  
Not a question, just wanna say my four years is coming up in 3 weeks. Glad that we could both live to ‚Äúmeet‚Äù over this occasion.  
Congratulations!! Is a strange thing to have in common but hopefully we'll have many more anniversaries to come!  
I wish the same to you! Let‚Äôs make the most of ourselves with our second shot at life  
What are doing now?  
I was in Australia studying abroad before Covid meant i had to come home. I've finished my studies online and now i'm just waiting around before my final year of university starts. In the mean time i'm picking up as many hobbies as i can manage and i've found a passion for trying to motivate and help others. i'm studying psychology and completed a counselling modules so although still very inexperienced i have some clinical knowledge and expertise to back up my advice  
Any advice for someone who has been battling with it for a while? What changes helped you feel better?  
i would say recognise that it's a disease. It like if you had a cold you would feel like shit and not want to leave the house. That's not you. You're not someone who doesn't want to leave the house. It's the cold, the flu, that makes you feel that way. Recognise that depression or whatever mental illness you may struggle with is a disease and it's that disease that makes you feel that way. It's not who you are.  I also found writing my own motivational messages was beneficial. Reading something i had written myself was a lot more motivating to me than reading or listening to someone else who doesnt know me.  
As someone who has gone through suicide attempts personally, do you find yourself having suicidal thoughts throughout these 4 years? Keep it up, youre worth it.  
I haven't, as soon as i decided that suicide was not an option i never considered it again. Depression and anxiety has felt like a race. It's like it's just over my shoulder and if you let it it catches up. At the moment i'm winning the race and i can feel myself pulling away. A few months ago i had an experience that almost broke me and i went back into survivor mode. But i'm back on track  
Good insight! It took me more than once to realize it wasn't worth it.  What has helped you the most?  
What do you mean?  
what do you mean?  
Nothing, it‚Äôs a joke, your username  
i know, that's why i said it back  
Bruh I really just pulled a r/woooosh on myself  
But for real tho, congrats, I‚Äôve dealt with depression myself and it‚Äôs a bitch  
I just want to say that I love you, you're meant to be here, I'm so happy you are still with us and I can't wait to see what you can do in the future.  
I don‚Äôt have the time on my hands to do anything more, but I just saw the title and wanted to drop in here and give you an upvote. Never give up!  
Is there anything that you have experienced that you are glad you didn't miss? aka a Game, Movie, Event, etc.  
I think seeing my older sister graduate. that was a real proud moment for me. I‚Äôve also experienced a lot of great moments and met some great people since. I was a virgin at the time too so sex is something i'm glad i didn‚Äôt miss!  
I just came here to say that I am glad you changed your mind and I wish you everything of the best. Take care of yourself! With love.  
Suicide is a permanent fix for a temporary problem. We‚Äôre glad you‚Äôre still here.  
A little late, but what do you mean better every day? I‚Äôve recently become fascinated with the idea of trying to improve myself bit my bit so I‚Äôd love to hear about how you did/do that and any tips. Thank you and glad you‚Äôre still with us!  
I wrote down what i want to improve about myself, only things that are realistic. I originally had 4 categories that i wanted to improve. My organisation, mentally relaxing, being physically active and hygiene. In each category i would have 3 items. My goals were small and easily achievable but i knew if i completed them i would be better off. Tidying my room, brushing my teeth, showering... things like that were some of my earliest goals and can be achieved over night . But witnessing the progress and knowing that i was better today than i was yesterday and i can be even better tomorrow was great, even by the smallest of margins. I've since added in more long term goals but i still have everyday goals that i want to achieve.  
Respect! I also have suicidal thoughts now and then. But music saves me each and every time.  
Music is great. I had to kick out a lot of songs though. I found some sad songs would feel like someone putting their arm around me but other songs just made me feel sad for myself and make my mood worse. those songs had to go

Learn what you like and what you don't like no matter how small it is. I wrote those things down to remind myself. I then would do the things that made me feel good and try my best to avoid the things that made me feel bad. After this i wrote down what i want to improve about myself, only things that are realistic. I originally had 4 categories that i wanted to improve. My organisation, mentally relaxing, being physically active and hygiene. In each category i would have 3 items. Each goal was something that i could change about myself overnight, e.g. washing my face, listening to a podcast, updating a calendar. I would then have 4 don'ts. These were 4 things that i need to stop doing or reduce. Along the way i found i started to like myself more as i was improving and treating myself with care,  
How did you learn to love yourself? I can‚Äôt seem to find things I enjoy and I‚Äôm too hard on myself when things go wrong.

Do you think you're cured of depression or you managed to live and cope up with it by learning to love yourself? I am asking because I think the thought of having depression is a curse and I don't think I'll ever be free of it. Thinking like that makes me just give up like "This is a disease and there's nothing I can do about it.  
Depression to me feels like i'm on a lake and i was running out of energy to keep my head above the water. I contemplated suicide when i was so tired i decided to stop swimming and drown. I may never get off the lake but what i can do is keep swimming and build a boat. Right now i'm on that boat and i'm trying to pick up anyone else who is in the lake drowning. I may never fall off that boat but i feel like it could still happen but i think now i have the tools to get back out again if i need to do so.  
You're so inspiring! Well done for getting through those difficult times; I don't know you, but I'm so proud of you! I'm struggling with depression at the moment and it's reading things like this, that really help me understand that things will get better. Thank you for your story <3  
What was significant in helping you to love yourself?  
I would just write down what i liked and what i didn‚Äôt like each day. Any small insignificant thing that made me smile that day i wrote down. The next day i would try and do as many of those things as possible. And on the contrary i would avoid all the things that i didn't like. How many times do you do something a feel shit after and think i always feel like this after x? For me it was a lot. This is where i first really started to take of myself and i learned what i like doing and loved doing those things. I would then look at ways i could improve myself. Things such as hygiene was great for me. It feels good to care for yourself. My confidence also grew immensely through working out. I've put on a lot of muscle and like how i look in the mirror  
I'm proud of you. That's awesome! I think we all make this little list you described, but in our heads. I would guess that putting it to paper makes you more accountable or something? I will DEFINITELY be trying this. Thank-you.  
Partially that but it serves as reminder too, you forget what made that day good and what made that day bad. if you're not careful you keep doing things that aren't good for you and forget what things make you smile  
It takes a whole lot of time and effort to get to where you are today. I‚Äôm proud of you for sticking with it and coming out on top of the darkness. What would you say the single most helpful thing is to help you stay positive?  
Thankyou, i think seeing improvements were the most motivating. My goals were small and easily achievable but i knew if i completed them i would be better off. Tidying my room, brushing my teeth, showering... things like that were some of my earliest goals and can be achieved over night . But witnessing the progress and knowing that i was better today than i was yesterday and i can be even better tomorrow was great, even by the smallest of margins.  
What are some tips for when people are trying to talk to people about shit they go through as they felt the same way you did 4 years ago?  What are some unconventional things you did to help better yourself?  
Show that you care and that you are listening. I would say how i wrote down anything that made me smile that day and anything that made me upset or down. Each day is made of little moments that at the end of the day decide whether it was good day or a bad one. If you can figure out what makes a good day for you then you can try and replicate it.  
how did you get past depression? i know this is a loaded question and i don‚Äôt expect an answer if you don‚Äôt feel like it  
The short answer is take a step in the right direction every day. Writing down messages to myself when i was on a high to read when i was a low were great motivators. I really just wrote down every little thing i enjoyed and made sure i did those things and wrote down any little thing that upset me or made me feel bad and avoided those things  
i‚Äôm so happy for you:)) someone may have already asked this but what words do you wish you had heard more during recovery?  
I think simply words of encouragement. I didn‚Äôt expect any because i was doing it alone and my improvements were so small that nobody other than me could realise, but i think conformation that i was travelling in the right direction would have been nice  
What are your dreams/aspirations?  
Just to be happy and to make others around me better tomorrow than they are today.  
I went through the same about 6 years ago. From reading your responses, what lead me there was different, but in the end we all understand each other once we‚Äôve reached that bleak point. Thank you for sharing your story and opening up to questions. I know for me, seeing that I wasn‚Äôt alone back then helped a ton.  What helped the most was getting on the right medication and taking time out of my day to meditate (which was totally new to me). If you‚Äôre severely depressed and reading this please don‚Äôt underestimate how much the right antidepressant can help. There are a lot of them and it can take time to find the one that works for you because every brain is different. But when I got mine settled, I felt completely normal and simply balanced like my old self, gradually over about 6 months.  Now I‚Äôm a mom with an even better reason to live (that‚Äôs the part where my world is completely different). It‚Äôs hard to imagine life before my daughter.  2020 has been ROUGH for my anxiety though. Have you found it hard to navigate current events? What do you do to cope? I think I still have guilt that I wanted to die. And now I‚Äôm constantly worried that there‚Äôs a real chance that I could die and leave my daughter motherless.  Sorry for rant.  
i've definitely been frustrated a lot recently but i'm student so i haven't lost my job or anything like that. im single at the moment too so i've not been relying on another person  for happiness and had them taken away due to social distancing. I definitely do get anxious but what i do is i start talking out loud about what i'm thinking and i make the scenario worse and worse and worse. eventually what i'm talking about just rubbish and i realise what i was worrying about is stupid. obviously this doesnt work for every scenario. But right now i'm just trying to be busy, i‚Äôve started loads of new hobbies around the house and it keeps my occupied. I really hope that helps in some way. Some my earlier responses outline how i battled with depression and how i moved forward. Hopefully some of those cnan be of use too  
I‚Äôve struggled with wanting to kill myself as well. In real up and down. What advice would you give me?  
When i was up i would write messages of encouragement and motivation for myself to read when i was down. I find words of encouragement from yourself are a lot more powerful  
Any suggestions?  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsSC2vx7zFQ This was one of my favourites also i listened to this joe rogan one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysTGb27yCcc Which made me laugh a bit because it's kind of exactly what i tried to do. I really just listened to a lot of different ones and picked up on the language they used and took some of that and what spoke to me and wrote my own.  This is what i wrote to myself in 2017. It continues on to some motivational messages but served as a reminder to why i was doing it. "One day i was looking for something to motivate me. Looking for a person to inspire me. But the thing is, that person isn't going to be there for you every time you're down. The only person who's going to be around you i you. So you need to learn to motivate yourself, Inspire yourself...." Before this i would just write messages to myself to read when i was down begging myself not to hurt and that the pain would subside. Those definitely helped in my darkest moments

Congrats on making it this far. I hope we have plenty more anniversaries in the years to come  
How did you change your self-image? Like, how did you change how you view yourself?  
I kept trying to improve myself and get better each day. I've put on a lot of weight (i needed to) and this has helped me like how i physically look  
Thanks for sharing your story. I was in this position 10 years ago (depressed and suicidal). My life is SO different now. It does get better.  
Do you have any tips for someone who‚Äôs in a similar boat as you were?  
Really try and reflect on you day and learn about yourself. treat yourself with kindness and you'll like yourself more and more  
YOU'RE GIVING ME FUCKING HOPE I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!  
That's amazing to hear!! i really hope you can take something away from some of my experiences and help improve your life! I LOVE YOU TOO!  
Which is/was better for you, 2016 or 2020?  
Personally for me 2020. I had an amazing start to the year that was cut short by covid by the start was great  
do you like shredded cheese  
yeah because then i don't have to grate it myself but self grated cheese is better than bought shredded cheese  
Congratulations! What would you tell someone who doesn't want to be here on this earth anymore?  
What would you recommend to say to somebody that tried to commit suicide? I have a friend that tried to kill themselves and i wasn't sure how to respond. Good job btw  
It's hard i think to get through to someone who is suicidal. I think the best thing to do is help them see how things can get better and that there is light at the end of the tunnel. Since my experience, i have studied psychology and learned a lot about mental illness. Understanding that you aren't well and what you're experiencing is common in a lot of people, but you can be cured is invaluable. I've also spoken to a lot of people who are suicidal by reaching out to them on reddit and other social media and a lot of people find comfort in knowing you care about them. It may seem obvious that people care about them but when you're in that state you can be in your house with a loving family or surrounded by friends and still feel alone, with nobody to care for you.  
What advise should I give my best friend who attempted suicide recently? How should I be there for him?

And what happens that next fall into the abyss... That fall when you realize this will always be in your cycle no matter what you have done to manuver your self away from thia road... It always leads back to here.. What happens when you stop believing the fantasy that things can get better only to loae them again. To be in a worse spot each time... Then what.... When you realize fighting threw mental hell only means you gain more than last fall so you can see yourself lose it again and take a bigger fall..... Then what... There is no end but to end  
I am so glad you didn‚Äôt,the world would be worse without you ‚ù§Ô∏è

At the points you were convinced you were going to do it, did you ever think about what the people around you would have thought or how they would have reacted?

Opinion on gingers? I'm happy to hear life is swell for you!!  
My brother is struggling now and I‚Äôm trying to do everything in my power to help him. I know I should listen and validate his feelings, not try to solve his problems for him. But it just seems like with whatever I do, nothing is enough. Do you have any advice on how I could help him? Even if it‚Äôs something small, any insight is appreciated. And I‚Äôm so happy for you. I‚Äôve had depression in the past and it‚Äôs one of the worst things any human could experience. I‚Äôm so glad you made it out alive and well. You are so strong for surviving that! :,D

Table of Questions and Answers. Original answer linked - Please upvote the original questions and answers.    Question Answer Link    No question, I just want to say congratulations :) Thankyou!! Here   Why did you want to die? What made you change your mind? I was really struggling with depression. This was partially due to my body image, i was 6ft 3 and 70kg (now 93kg).  i had really struggled with my mum going through breast cancer as i didn't speak to anyone about it and bottled it all up. I was ashamed with how i handled visiting her in the hospital and should have seen her more often.  A week before i was going to kill myself someone i was friends with jumped in front of a train, killing himself. I saw the effect his death had on the people around me, people who he didnt think care about him we distraught and i saw how devastated his family was. I remember breaking down a couple nights later after the shock had worn off and promised myself i would never put Here   good for you! stay strong! Thankyou!! Here   Thank you for sharing this. I'm currently in a similar place to where you were, but trying to seek help so I don't hurt my friends and family. How did you move forward after deciding to live? So i really just started analysing myself. At the end of the day i would i write down what made me happy today. Anything small, like singing in the shower or working out. I would then make a list of anything that lowered my mood throughout the day. I would then make sure i did the things that made me happy and avoided the things that i didn‚Äôt like. I would also write down what i didn‚Äôt like about myself but only specific things. things that i could work towards and change about myself. I now know how to make myself happy when i'm sad, how to motivate myself and how to improve myself. Here   Why didn't you? What stopped you from the moment you finished planning to the moment you decided not to? Someone i was friends with committed suicide a couple days before. I saw the effect it had on everyone around me and how badly it hurt everyone. I didn't realised how badly i would have hurt the people around me, it was an eye opener and showed how much everyone really does care about you, even if it's not clear Here   thank you for staying. everyone is glad that you did and i hope youre doing good :) Thankyou, i'm doing great!! Here   No questions, just congrats and best of wishes to you. Thankyou, i appreciate it! Here   No questions, just congrats, I‚Äôm so happy for you :D Thankyou!! Here   congrats man! sadly my friend commited suicide February of this year, i failed to be a friend one last time... one question tho how wud u handle someone who is suicidal? what is the best advice u have to give? It's hard i think to get through to someone who is suicidal. I think the best thing to do is help them see how things can get better and that there is light at the end of the tunnel. Since my experience, i have studied psychology and learned a lot about mental illness. Understanding that you aren't well and what you're experiencing is common in a lot of people, but you can be cured is invaluable. I've also spoken to a lot of people who are suicidal by reaching out to them on reddit and other social media and a lot of people find comfort in knowing you care about them. It may seem obvious that people care about them but when you're in that state you can be in your house with a loving family or surrounded by friends and still feel alone, with nobody to care for you. Here   hi thank you for opening up to strangers:) i‚Äôm struggling with a few things myself so : how did you get the motivation to move forward  from such a dark place? in my own experience it took talking to my brother but i feel like i have nobody right now and this made me smile, and have hope in even myself:) thank you so much i used to listen to loads of motivational speeches but then i started writing my own. i found that my own voice was so much better for me than hearing the voice of another and i could keep myself motivated. Feel free to PM and i'll share some of the things i've written Here   What do you feel is the first step to the road to recovery? What would you say to yourself to really change your mind? How planned out and committed were you to it? Thank you for sharing and I'm glad you have been able to fight past that point in your life. Stay strong and live long I think the first step it recognising that you are loved. When my friend committed suicide i saw how much people cared for him. People who you didn‚Äôt think cared, were crying and were in pieces. It made me realise that people care for me just as much as they care about him.  My mind was changed from that point onwards and i knew that i had to change. Depression was like a pit that i had fell into and you fucking stay in it unless you claw and climb your way out. I wasn't trying to get out before.  I was pretty committed, i had chosen the day and i knew the place. There's a hill near where i live and it looks over an old flood plane from the ice age. You can see for miles and miles. And from left to right a train runs all the way across. I had planned to sit on one of the bridges above the track and jump off into a train. Who knows if i would have chickened out; but i was pretty set on it at the time. Here   What do you mean? what do you mean? Here   First of all, I want to congratulate you. Second, what was wrong with your image? I'm curious because I have literally the same measures Partly because i played Rugby i was particularly conscious about my size, i also had been teased a lot about being skinny so my self confidence was really low Here    Source

I had the same plan 5 years ago. High five.  
How does it feel like  
I'm so happy that you didn't go through with it. I can tell you first-hand that it does devastate those who are left behind. My brother, the third of five (my sis and I are sixth & seventh of seven kids) was the one I was closest to. He never married so he came over often and watched my children grow up. He was over every holiday and was basically our oldest child. He was content being home on his computer playing the latest games. Then he got sick. Lung cancer. Had a lung removed and went through chemo. I didn't work anymore (disabled)so I would drive him to and from. They got rid of it (or so we thought). A couple of years later he came over as usual and was acting different. Asked him if he was OK and he told me to take him to ER. I had to fill out his paperwork because he couldn't remember his birthdate, address etc. Scared the hell out of me. There was good reason. He had advance brain cancer. They did what they could but it was bad. Then he started loosing his eyesight. That took away the only thing he love the best. His games. He'd been through sooo much and he knew it wasn't going to get better so he shot himself. After a few days noticed he hadn't been over so went to his place. His mail box was over flowing so I went to his door and pounding on it. Shocked I went home and called the police for a wellness check. With all that he was going through a I can kinda understand, especially as he lived alone. It took me YEARS to realize I couldn't have done anything to stop this from happening. The guilt was all consuming. It was like a tape going on a loop. Saw a therapist to help me sort out all that had happened. Everyone was knocked on their ass. Then came the will. My husband and i  undertook his wishes. My one religeous brother wasn't going to come out from Texas to California because he killed himself. Then he heard there was a will. He was out on the next flight. Accused us of cheating him. We were traumatized and he was worried about money. I haven't spoken to him since. It's been 10 years. Another went off the wagon. The oldest ended up OD`ing on heroin. He brother who killed himself was the first of seven to go. Things happen that we would never imagine. Sorry for the length. I'm so glad you changed your mind. It's amazing that if people who are thinking about killing themself would wait just one week, day, hour things could radically change. Much respect to you.  
Likewise. Many times. I could count them on both hands. Don‚Äôt know exactly why I‚Äôm still going. Sex and learning seems to be the motives to keep going. Better than none, I suppose.  
Mega congrats, this is awesome. And good on you for posting this: it‚Äôs something many people truly need to hear.  
I heard the hospitals are in bad shape. 200% capacity in ICUs, people under 65 being turned away, strokes and heart attacks not even getting treated. Have you seen any of this or heard of it?  
To be honest, only in lombardy the situation is critical and the lockdown was set to prevent additional spreading. You will be turned away only if you have minor symptoms. Into hospitals there are only really bad or "only" bad cases, if you manifest minor symptoms, you stay at home until recover or some worsening.  Strokes and heart attacks is still cured normally everywhere and all hospitals are trying to be ready to a spike of infection.  So, we are not living in a nightmare,  don't worry  
O you have no idea how your comment soothed me. I was so worried. I wish I could afford gold.  
Happy to ear that. I'm not minimizing or else, the situation is bad but we are not on the verge of the collapse yet.  I think the lockdown was necessary as early as last week but there still time and we're not sending people home to their death. Edit:  So, it seems that the lockdown measures of the past days have some effect on the spreading. Here the graph from an official site.  Hopefully it will be a positive trend.  
Where I live, all we see is riots, prisoners escaping, and tanks. So, hearing you say your not is amazing. I have brothers and sisters there.  
That's unfortunately true and the biggest problem right now  
Yes that‚Äôs my biggest fear right now as an American. That we will get to that point. I‚Äôm a nurse (but I don‚Äôt work in the hospital anymore thankfully) and this time of year is already almost at capacity and staffing is very thin. It‚Äôs scary. I‚Äôm so sorry this is happening in your beautiful country. Are you scared?  
[deleted]  
Oof. That sounds like a bad situation for the UK. But just because their situation sounds worse than ours doesn‚Äôt make me feel much better about the fact that the US isn‚Äôt prepared for this.  
Not for myself but it's not a good situation  
How old are you? Do you have any health issues? Do you know anyone personally who has the virus?  
Fellow US nurse chiming in. I‚Äôm starting to get worried too. Used to work in the ER but now I‚Äôm in outpatient surgery and I fear this is exactly what‚Äôs going to happen.  
How about maternity wards? What are women doing who need to be in hospital to give birth?  
In your comment on the other thread, you mention needing ‚Äúgood reason if you want to leave town‚Äù. Are there actually police restricting travel at the outskirts? What other involvement/enforcement action is your government taking to enforce the lockdown to your knowledge?  
There are random checks, is not heavily enforced, some people have being caught but it's on the people to do the right thing  
What happens when they are caught? are they just told to turn around and go home?  When you say town, is that like a city and its suburbs? or are the suburbs separate?   What if you work in another town? Are the businesses required to either pay you or allow you to work from home?  
I also jump in quick to answer the rest of the questions:  fine (250‚Ç¨ i believe) or prison without good reason yes. Good reasons are: for work, for necessary groceries if you dont have them in your city/ village, if you need medical help many places in italy are very country sided. I live in a village with 3k people. Towns are the closest to the villages at around 10-100k citizens and cities is everything above. if you still get to keep your job or arent send on vacation you are allowed to travel between both cities, however, the gov is advising to offer home office work I own a business in the service sector and cant really give home work to my employees. I sent 90% of my employees on vacation until the 3 of april. They are using up all the overtime and vacation days. If the situation isnt getting better I delay it till may.   
Interesting. Thank you for the response.  So you send them home but they have to use vacation time? What happens if they don't have any vacation days left?  Or alternatively if they already have vacation plans in July and by using it up now they won't have any then?    No judgement here, just curious. It's a matter of debate among my colleagues and friends where I live (even though there is only one case anywhere near me right now).   As it stands at my office, if you are quarantined though no active fault of your own (like traveling to countries above a certain threat level on the cdc list) then the company pays you during your quarantine and no vacation time or sick time used.   I realize this is technically different than sending people home during a lock down versus a quarantine, but was still curious how other places deal with it.  
There are fines and jail time, you can move for work  
Is there anyone outside taking a walk? Can you go to the bank as well as the grocery store? Or to a mall? Are shops open? Do you get a sense your neighbors are sick? Or is t far and few between?  
You can go outside and to shops, there are just restriction on how many people can stay close together  
So there are shops open?? Meaning some people are still going to work? I‚Äôm confused, that doesn‚Äôt sound like a lockdown ... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  
People are restricted to move and can't aggregate, a lot of shops are open and people go to work  
I think you mean congregate.  And that leads me to the question, are churches holding service?  It's interesting, feels like they maybe shouldn't, but people are still expected to go to their work/office edit: ok to clarify, I don't think people /should/ be going to unnecessary gatherings like church, I was just curious if they could. Or if anyone is still trying to even if it's banned.  I'm not religious, but I'm from the south in the us, and I've known people who would protest hard against that restriction no matter how rational the ban may be  
How is that restriction enforced? Just trust?  
i went to McDonald's the other day and the stuff would tell you to stay 1 meter away from each other and if you get close they will remind you again. a guy was hugging his wife and got really pissed of cause he had to keep a distance lol  
That's ridiculous, obviously spouses who live in the same home and share everything including of bed can still hug one another at a McDonald's.  
Police forces check, just a little tho  
Are the police doing anything other than enforcing the restrictions? For context, here in the UK, our PM's plan of we go into lockdown is the police will be instructed to ignore all minor crimes and work solely on major crimes and restricting travel.  
About shops they can have random control about it and they risk big fines if they don't observe the rules... so they want the client to follow the rules  
What is the general sentiment from people you know? Are people very worried, or is it simply an inconvenience. I know you had mentioned people arent necessarily raiding the grocery stores.  Also, how many people are still going to work? How many places are closed?  
I think they are thinking about it like an inconvenience and not more, people still go to work, a lot of places are open, especially the important ones  
How are they enforcing the lockdown?  
Random police check, mainly trusting people to do the right thing  
I drove to Napoli from Pompeii this morning. There were no checks on the roads. I then was in Napoli train station and Termini Station in Roma. They were screening passengers getting on to trains in Roma, but not passengers arriving. No one stopped me, but I look like a six foot tall leprechaun and I was headed towards the airport.  
That would defenitively not work in my country (Portugal) :)  
You cant say that until you live it, everybody would have said the same thing here two days ago.  
It doesn't work nowhere because people aren't taking it serious enough. Even in Germany peoples biggest concern is missing festivals and football games. At work I have to fill in for a colleque because she went to the Doc with her child. Another person who might have Corona was there as well, withouth warning the doc or anything you HAVE to do. Anyway every person who was there yesterday has to stay at home for two weeks. Great. What a bunch of morons.  
I firmly believe that it‚Äôll take the Olympics being cancelled for people to take it seriously  
Folks just wouldn't care. Coronavirus outbrake? Nah. Ain't nobody got time for that. Sweet day for a party üòÇüòÇüôÉ  
This is kind of what has been happening here... it's still the first day so it's too soon to say it for sure, but many people said that didn't care and wanted to have fun anyway  
So the police just admitted they're breaking the lockdown  
It's unlawful for coronavirus to infect the police. It certainly will not help spread it to the entire nation.  
Killing a cop is illegal. The virus will go to jail.  
No, the police are at work, and you are allowed to go to work. :)  
Instead of cancelling whole serie A, cant they let managers play 1vs1 at fifa? And the winner gets 3pts.  
You should propose that lol  
How far has the virus spread in your area?  
From what I know not much, but no way of knowing for sure  
Are you afraid?  
Nope, the virus is dangerous only for old or sick people, the lockdown is not that drammatic  
I understand not being afraid of the virus (I‚Äôm not either) but how about being afraid of people going nuts/ panicking etc.?  
The situation looks pretty calm right now, I don't think it's gonna get that bad  
Thanks for confirming my belief that this isn't as big a deal as reddit thinks. Looks like some people here were expecting a post apocalyptic scenario to be described.  
As a young healthy individual, I am afraid because i have loved ones that are old/sick.  
this is so not true. The virus is dangerous for anyone. Yes, older people are more likely to die but just look at patient 1. He is 38 and in very good shape... but only now, after more than two weeks can he finally breathe without help. He was intubated until yesterday.  
Is it a huge inconvenience having to take online classes or is it pretty easy?  
I feel it's a lot worse than being in class, better than nothinf√¨g  
I did a semester of all online classes and hated it. Something about not having that interaction just made it so uninteresting.  
What‚Äôs your impression of the overall situation?  
I feel is just a precautionary and so I don't think it's so drammatic  
[removed]  
I think so, it's not common where I live  
Do you know anything about receiving post and parcels? My dad just sent me my birthday gift from the UK but I have no idea if the postal service has been stopped in the province of Modena.  
From what I understand, Deliveroo is available in Rome, at least.  
How are people who can‚Äôt work remotely expected to make a living?  
People can go to work  
Do you know the restrictions on this? For example if you can work from home you should but if not, go to work and keep distance?  
Not OP, but I'm italian. In general, if your workplace is open, you're expected to go to work, but I guess every workplace has set its own rules. For example, at my mom's office, it was suggested to be contacted by client only via email or phone, not in person (the boss didn't agree, despite being absolutely possibile for the kind of work they do, but maybe other offices do that). Moreover, restaurant should close earlier and pubs shouldn't open at all (but unfortunately many of them don't do this), so if you work there, or in other structures that shoul be closed, you just stay at home.  
The whole quarantine thing seems very "loose" or casual.  
You are encouraged to work from home and of course follow all the precaoutions  
IS ALL THE PASTA GONE!?  
Italian here. This reminded me of what happened a few days ago where I live (central Tuscany). After the first grocery stores raids, the pasta aisle was completely empty. Except for penne lisce. Nobody likes that shit. Edit: typos  
don't think so  
Not while Strega Nonna lives and breathes. Edit n  
Strega Nonna Fights Corona Somehow this is not my first Strega Nona fake book title comment in the past few months  
Baader-Meinhof phenomenon in full effect. Last night I literally found a treasure trove of my favorite childhood books as I was clearing out my old home, and I settled in to read Strega Nona for the first time in decades.  
Do you know any infected personally?  
Are you restricted to staying indoors?  
Has your University articulated their plan for students? I'm a geology student, and a lot of classes in my department could not be done online, because they require samples, field work, maps, etc. I'm curious about what your University is doing for students in those kinds of degree programs.  
Mine started doing all the lessons online, every departement has to figure it out of themselves but they are taking action, don't know about any particular cases  
[deleted]  
Are people allowed to work? I'm guessing the people working at the grocery stores are?  
Are you concerned for your health (that you may catch the virus)  
Not op but I'm also italian and live in one of the "red zones". I'm not afraid for myself since it's not that dangerous for young/healthy people but I'm concerned for my parents and grandparents  
Which are the red zones? Is it still mainly in the northern provinces or are there cases all over the country now?  
Technically there are no more red zones now since the whole country is on lockdown, but it used to be mainly the northern regions. Here you can find a map of cases in Italy, red dots represent infections and black dots represent deaths  
How badly are people freaking out over there?  
I‚Äôm not from Italy but from Germany and people here are going crazy. There is no toilet paper, no noodles, no flour, no rice and every store is out of disinfectant gel/wipes/whatever. Yesterday, two Germans died due to the virus and it‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs on the news (I have to add: They were both kinda old and I‚Äôm pretty sure I heard that one of them had some heart problems or something).  The minister of health said to avoid public events with more than 1000 people. Politicians are discussing possibilities of a lockdown (so far, we‚Äôve had cases of the virus in 15 out of 16 states. The state I live in has the most (almost 600) cases) but tHaT wOuLd Be BaD fOr EcOnOmY miMiMiMiMiimiiIiIii. However, if the virus keeps spreading like this, we‚Äôll have around 100,000 infected people by the end of April and almost 1,000,000 by the end of May. This will lead to a full utilisation of all capacities (tests, hospitals, medication). So Italy is definitely doing the right thing. I‚Äôm not scared of the virus (I‚Äôm a bit worried about my dad because he‚Äôs had two heart attacks and he has a very weak immune system). I just hope that if there was to be a lockdown, it should be before the next semester starts (April 1st) so I don‚Äôt have to take online classes.  
This is interesting to know! I work in America but for a German owned company. We don‚Äôt need to communicate daily and the time difference usually ends up with mostly emails. With the language barrier it often makes some questions seem different to them so I haven‚Äôt wanted to ask directly if they are going crazy over this.  Your description of what is happening sounds very familiar to here also. Everyone sold out of toilet paper, water, hand sanitizer etc. but no lockdowns. However as of today many of my local schools have closed and many universities are only doing online classes-however it is now spring break for University level and some Universities cancelled it and instead have students going to class as normal and others did not but are slowly saying not to come back to school-just will be online.  I can only imagine the economic effects they are discussing for if production stopped in Germany it definitely would also cause our location to become financially unstable very quickly.  Thank you for your input!!!  
I feel like the news portrays Italy as falling apart, but it seems pretty average right now.  
Obviously they are going to report it as falling to shreds, they gotta get those clicks

Without giving away your address, what is the size of the town you live and how is your community responding to the quarantine? Fear? Frustrations? Don't care?  
10k, I have not gotten out today (of course) so I cant say but I heard my friend and from my parents who got out everything is cool

From your answers it sounds like not much has changed. People can go to work. People are just supposed to "do the right thing". What exactly HAS changed? Schools are closed? Events are canceled? Anything else? Are people not allowed to enter or leave the city?  
How are you until now?  
How much does Italy‚Äôs economy rely on tourism and do you think the lockdown will have long term effects? Also, how are people‚Äôs moods? Is it mass confusion, fear, anger?  
I heard from another redditor that people really don't care about the lockdown and do whatever they want. That redditor said they live in Italy. Is this the case where you live or are people listening to the warnings?  
What part of Italy are you from dude? Also, what do you think about this decision taken by the government? (I'm also from Italy, and I'm kind of annoyed by this whole situation)

Are major tourist destinations closed to the public?  
Are veterinary stations open? What can people with pets on special diets do if they're under quarantine? I know it's an unusual question, but i have an elderly cat that's 1. very picky, 2. needs special veterinary diet food and i worry if my city will start imposing similar restrictions, whether i would be able to get my cat her food. Could i get special veterinary food delivered to me?  
Are there any cases close to you?  
Are the restaurants and cafes open? Do you need a temperature check before you can go in?  Related question: Has restaurant business been affected? Does the government has plans to help small businesses that are affected? Thanks for doing this and stay safe!

Are you still required to pay full price for classes that are now being given online. In the US, online classes are extremely cheap compared to on site classes. I can't imagine the schools will discount you  
from what i see a lot of the precautions put in place are based on trust unlike how here in china they locked everything down, do you think this is gonna last or do you think the governement is gonna put martial law and actually enforce curfews?  
My son is stationed in Vicenca and says they are granting US soldiers leave to come to the US. He also says they still go off base to a local bar and tattoo shop.   How can this be?  Should he even consider trying to fly to the US on leave or should he stay put until this passes?  
Do you think your government is doing enough? Is the lock down really like empty streets or people go about as usual? I live in a city with a high infection rate too, even though everyone go on their normal day with a mask on, I am still to scared to go anywhere.  
Di dove sei fra?  
Did you have any advance notice (official or otherwise) that the lockdown was coming? How quickly did this all come about? Thanks  
Many independent business owners presumably can't afford to keep paying employees who are not working during the shut down, due to lost sales. Has the government addressed the issue of workers who count on their wages to meet their monthly expenses?  
I‚Äôve been thinking about you all. It sounds like overall you are well and there aren‚Äôt any crazy things going on over there. I‚Äôm glad for that.  I wonder how long it will be before all this dies down and also how long before an immunization is created.  
Are you surprise by the amount of questions about people panicking or in risk of dying of starvation for not being able to go outside their houses to work or buy food? Because I‚Äôm seriously at awe about people expectations for the lockdown.

Thanks for doing this OP. I'm praying for your country, and praying for all of us in general. These are strange times. You going to work today? How you feeling?  
Whats your opinion/feeling/reaction on all this? Confused? Worried? Or something else? I'm from Estonia and there are currently 10 people infected but people are already going crazy and raiding stores.  
Why is number of deaths reported to infected people so big in Italy compared to countries like Germany or South Koreea? Any conclusion, or is there a talk about that in italian media?  
How are the authorities monitoring if people try to leave town? Do they have guards on all of the roadways and Aircraft monitoring other paths of travel? Or is more of an honor system?  
How is the general atmosphere? Are people taking it serious, or downplaying it as "just a flu"? Does the general public think the lockdown is necessary?  
I have no questions, I just had noticed you said you were watching a uni lecture and I wanted to comment that this is some serious procrastination haha  
Is there an accurate test yet for the virus? If so, how is it being applied where you live?  
Me and my GF (38 /32) had planned to spend this weekend in Napoli, flying in from Paris, purely for leisure. I still kinda want to do it. Would you advise against ? I'm not afraid of getting sick, but feels like a dick move in regards to public health.  
What do you plan on doing to pass the time in lock down and how long if at all do you know untill the restrictions are lifted?  
Are universities closed too? How many staff are working in the hospital rn? Is that limited too?  
Are people able to walk/run/jog outside? Are kids going to parks and playgrounds?  
Could you tell the your government was planning a lockdown, or was it a surprise? Did they project it a bit?  
Do you try to be extra cautious when touching door handles or eating or something like that.

Agree there‚Äôs no winning. How would you reduce  or better manage gangs or drugs if you were the government, a cop, or a parent?  
I‚Äôm not sure how you could solve it apart from legalising drugs, take money from the criminals and decriminalise addicts and control and regulate drugs. That would go a long way. The one thing I see which is always the same all gang members are from a somewhat broken home and the more broken/abusive the more violent and committed to the life they are. So I would say strengthen support systems for young people and focus on ending poverty. Also make punishments not as harsh for low level corruption, once a police officer has taken a bribe or done something corrupt, they are stuck and just deep a bigger whole. But mainly legalise drugs that‚Äôs gangs main income usually and people die because they cut drugs with dangerous stuff, legalising drugs would solve that  
As a former cop, I agree whole heartedly with legalization... mainly because drugs is a "my body, my choice" thing, but also to hit the wallets of the drug rings. I also think more research and education should be going along with the legalization.  
It would save a lot of kids from OD'ing. I'm 23F and had a stimulant addiction for a few years. This lead to me knowing a lot of people my age on drugs. I'd say in the last 2 years I've known of at least 15 people around my age who OD'ed. I heard of many many more who I didn't know.  Almost no one doing drugs is informed on what drugs do neurologically/chemically. They don't know the difference between a synthetic opiate and a natural opiate, or what those things might do to your brain over time, but they know they hate morphine pills and love percocet or tabs.  If there was more open discussion I think a lot of my friends might not be dead today.  
Definitely more people need un bias education, not bias anti drug rambles imo. As a former cop was corruption a big issue in your station ? And did you catch most big drug dealers eventually ?  
To answer your question first, I never worked in drug units. I did see some corruption, one being officer jackass was stalking my mom and his son dealt weed with no consequences from what I could see. But I wasn't a cop then, I was a community services officer. Parking tickets, animal control and low priority calls at 19 years old. Then I went into the reserve academy and had to stop working there for the academy which they put on and i failed out of 2 weeks prior (after 6 months) to graduation for being 15 mins late to my psych evaluation. (Working full time 40-60 hours a week and doing 20-30 hrs at the academy) Me helping my coworkers caused me to be late. A young and dumb mistake. However, I did tell officer jackass, "if I catch you around my moms house again, I will leave your body on the commanders desk with the report stapled to your head".  When I was Military Police, I was a Traffic investigator and was used for 2 state side emergencies and riot control in Italy which was mainly ride around on a bike in an area that was so overloaded with caribinari and policia, that It was nearly a vacation. But there were certainly things I noticed that made me want to just say, "fuck it". And chose a different path.  All in all, I earned the title from the army, but didn't use it much. I believe in shades of grey. I mainly just wanted the training and some experience. L.E. is not my calling. I've also done volunteer firefighting, which was better in my opinion. Ironically, I've been shot at multiple times, all of which, I was off duty. Wrong place, right time scenarios.  
Everyone warns kids about how bad drugs are,but no one warns them about how good they are.

But legalizing drugs like heroin will result to an insane increasing of the addicts beacause heroin&co causes 100% of dependence  
yeah, hit their wallets and it's pretty much game over. The government has a lot of power but sometimes I think lacks intelligence, they fight drug dealers with force and guns, sometime you just have to make a smart move and pull all of their money from under then, it would be pretty much game over. And I don't know the stats but would guess, as many deaths there are from drugs, there is defiately a lot of violence involved in the drug dealing business, most of that would be solved if the governments all legalised and decriminalised drugs. they would make a killer profit too. no brainer.  
I think the education is key too. I remember being in grade school taught all drugs were bad. I don't care for any of them but booze and tobacco are probably way worse of an impact than weed. I've also heard plenty of accounts where weed is all someone touches (so much for "gateway drug") and booze is probably far more dangerous than weed as far as what it does to the brain.  But people also assume if you smoke, you'll want it all the time. Do I show up drunk to work? No. Would I expect someone showing up high as hell? No. That's common sense  
After I got out of the army and quit all LEO type of work, I eventually ended up working on a pot farm for my tribe. Largest outdoor grow in the state. Harvest seasons always smelled great! My early 20's I binge drank and partied too hard. Now a days, I just enjoy my smoke. I agree with treating it like alcohol. Not gonna lie though, I don't mind being allowed to smoke at work. It was rare that I would, but some days, it was nice. The thing that would drive me nuts tho is id trim up to 3lbs a day on my own and my 3 employees would do a pound each in the same amount of time. I was so close to calling my boss to say we shouldn't be smoking on breaks... soon damn close.  
Bro all the research backs up everything you‚Äôre saying here. In countries where drugs have been legalised and regulated, it has virtually wiped out the crime related to it.  
Which countries?  
Although I'm unsure about crime statistics, Portugal is often the go to example for the effectiveness of decriminalizing on a wide scale and implementing government funded harm reduction programs on a large scale. They nearly entirely solved their AIDS/heroin crisis by decriminalizing drug use and putting the money that was being spent on trying to catch or jail addicts into programs to rehabilitate them.  Although selling drugs is still illegal I believe you cant be arrested for buying them.  
https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/357234 Here‚Äôs an interesting paper on Swiss drug policy and the individual and societal benefits of treating heroin addiction through their legal heroin maintenance program.  
So what you're saying is, we will never solve the war on drugs in America. Because hate to say it ain't so and don't disagree with you, that just doesn't seem to be in the cards in this lifetime.  
Read this https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yw4nnk/how-the-us-stopped-a-possible-solution-to-the-heroin-epidemic  
what‚Äôs your favorite drug? what‚Äôs the worst you‚Äôre seen a drug/drug addiction to do someone??  
My favourite would be LSD or possibly heroin (I snorted it once back when I was 14 and never did it again after that), I‚Äôve seen someone crash a funeral high on amphetamines, someone‚Äôs tried to give away there unborn baby‚Äôs crib for a fix, I‚Äôve seen some try and sell their fathers boat, I‚Äôve seen people steal from family and I‚Äôve seen people‚Äôs skin literally rot off, I‚Äôve  seen someone pick heroin over their family, I‚Äôve seen someone cough blood (a lot of it too) and I‚Äôve seen a close friend become a heroin addict and lose everything. I‚Äôve seen too many things to list and the worst thing depends on what your priorities are, I think it‚Äôs sadder seeing someone lose everything than OD and dying but most things I‚Äôve seen is pretty horrific  
those are all very tragic things:( how did you stop yourself from doing heroin again??  
After using it, I was depressed because I new I would never feel so good again. It‚Äôs honestly so good it‚Äôs indescribable and I understood how i could easily spiral into abuse and made it a no question rule that I would never do any opiates again as I‚Äôve seen how bad addiction is  
Relatable. I only fucked with that stuff a few times, then did a few speed balls. It's been over 4 years since my last and I think about it almost everyday. That feeling of "I'll never feel that good again" is depressing af.  
Good for you man! I got addicted to MDMA, or well the feel good feeling,  for about a year and broke free of that shit cycle. Ugh.  
H impacted me really weird when I snorted it. I didn‚Äôt enjoy it and stayed away from it. But goddammit meth and coke got me good for a few years. Dealt slabs out in Panorama City just to keep my habit supplied and my rent paid. Can‚Äôt imagine dealing heavier. You still in or did you get out?  
Can you describe the feeling? Both my parents were heroin addicts and I was born so early I nearly died. I was probably addicted when I was born but no one has confirmed this. Both parents got clean and lead normal lives and scared me senseless of EVER trying a drug, even pot!  
The underground economy fascinates me. How did you keep track of your profits? Were you independent? You mention eradicating gangs. Were you in a gang?  
I‚Äôm overly organised and obsessive about money, I kept a detailed record of all my income and expenses, until I made to much to keep track of. I became independently eventually after working with a group. The police would of called us a gang but we always said we were just entrepreneurs, we were kind of a gang but not a traditional one. We beefed and worked with a lot of street gangs though who are deeply rooted in the community and cannot easily be eradicated  
Thanks for answering, like I said the underground economy is interesting. I wonder how much GDP is unaccounted for? Anyway, what do you think about dark web sites and drugs? Are they the future?  
For more careful responsible drug users but a heroin addict won‚Äôt want to wait 3 days shipping, addicts won‚Äôt know how or have the patience to use it. It helped me start selling valium originally and is good for buying illicit precursors, many people tell me it‚Äôs golden age has passed and I would hate to see the police be able to shut it down. I‚Äôm not very techy though, I have no idea if that‚Äôs possible GDP, it‚Äôs got to be billions I would think ? when your adding in fraud and high level organised crime it‚Äôs gotta be a really high figure  
As an ex opiate/heroin addict, I can tell you thats definitely not true, and that I knew a bunch of users who exclusively bought from DWM.   ‚Äã There are functional addicts out there.  
So you‚Äôre this dude (1:51) sorry, couldn‚Äôt resist.  
[removed]  
Getting stabbed, my friend got 8 years, another friend got badly jumped, my brother and my friend got addicted to drugs I used to sell, my parents finding out, losing all my money and getting serious threats and best times counting my money, realising I was actually a respected dealer in my area, eating every day and never going hungry, mocking my teacher who said I was a failure and telling him how my watch costs more than he makes in a year (Yh ik that was harsh but I was younger) and getting the money which will let me go to university to name a few  
[removed]  
Would of guessed it but not long after that the school nurse told all the teachers I had been stabbed and then they all kinda new. I think my parents might of told them as well Wdym status ? Status at school or as a dealer ?  
I‚Äôm not the one who asked the first question but do you still deal? Or did everything that‚Äôs happened that‚Äôs bad make you want to stop?  
How did your parents react?  
This is my second account Their response was fair enough, I got a justified beating and thy searched the house for drugs but found nothing but cash, they said they‚Äôd kick me out when I go to 16 but they never went through with it. They also told the school for some reason and never trusted me again  
How common is rivalry? Like how many other plugs would you get into beef with? How big is the city you're in, in terms of population?  
I‚Äôm in a big town. Rivalry depends on what approach you take, when I was in my group we had 3 main gangs we really beefed and had 2 allies gangs but the beef was partly because of postcode and history.  You could stay out of other people‚Äôs way make less money and have no rivals or you could go all out and try run the borough, no point tho because you‚Äôll just lose money if you go all out and beef will never end. Most people beef around one or two groups and it‚Äôs more because of petty reasons as much for the territory. Everyone just wants the parks and the big estates  
This comment completely gives you away. Its not hard to know what city you‚Äôre in. Pls delete this.  
Ok i would probably remove that number and round to 10 million youre doxxing yourself dude...  
What was your closest call?  
With police ? They raided a house that I was confronting someone at, they arrested 7 of my associates but I got over then fence with a few other people. With rivals ? I was stabbed but after 10 mins got up an walked home, I was fine after 2 days and another time I was getting chased and nearly got hit by a car, it stoped just in time and only tapped me  
Did you choose to be a drug dealer? If yes, why?  
I was kinda pressured in but it was my choice, I just wanted money I can‚Äôt lie. Started with needing school uniform an more important stuff but just turned into wanting luxury stuff and then I realised that I do enjoy dealing  
I‚Äôve seen this show before... Glad you stopped before it‚Äôs late  
I love the fact that you take ownership in your wrongs and not casting blame on ‚Äúcircumstances‚Äù. You‚Äôre halfway through the battle.  
Sorry if this is too personal, but what do you deal? Weed, coke, MDMA? Edit: also, have an upvote :)  
Originally coke, valium and ket, I then progressed to heroin and spice K2. Then I became a small time dealer only making a lot less and sold MDMA, most psychs, THC extracts, GHB and some lesser known stuff  
Wow. So you would front the money, and just hope to earn it back?  I would never deal, but how does one get started?  
I originally washed cars till I had enough to invest in coke, I then invested the profit in buying more coke and so on. Or older people will supply you and you sell it then pay them back, that‚Äôs often risky though as you don‚Äôt want to get in debt and your held accountable if you get robbed or the stuff gets confiscated.  
Yeah. Scary shit. Thanks for being so open. I always wondered how people got started with it. I have some friends that deal, and they make enough to afford a house in a new development here in Houston. Fucking crazy. Living the lavish lifestyle. Edit: edited the location because some people can‚Äôt get a grip.  
Sometimes a dealer will bankroll you to get started.  For me I had been a buyer for a while and started picking up for others whilst there. Then realised I could party for free by buying in bulk and splitting. Then I realised I could make money as well. Went to my dealer, asked for a list of stuff on Tick. Went into a weekly cycle. Pick up on Thursday, pay on Tuesdays.  Worked well and just kept escalating.  
Thanks for this reply. I‚Äôm just genuinely curious. Falling into a reddit rabbit hole and came across this post and thought ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù why not ask.  
fuck spice. Spice is some nasty shit.  
One of two drugs I ever tried and I ended up losing my mind for like 6 hours straight. It was awful.  
yeah ive had a few friends who have been spiced because we live in the uk and some people "spice" weed. Its horrible they turn into like zombies  
Did you ever question motives around K and GHB? Every refuse someone you knew was going to drug someone?  
Do people use ket for date rape? Me and my circle of friends used to take it a lot when kids and I never heard of anyone using it for that but I guess I‚Äôm not surprised.  
OPs second account No, I sold GHB when I became a small street dealer and new all my customers personally, I knew they would never do anything like that. In terms of Ketamine it‚Äôs not as often used because you have to inject it I think ? Anyway I‚Äôm confident that neither were used for that purpose and never even suspected anyone wanted to do anything other than get high  
Whet is key like what effect I keep hearing of it  
It's a dissociative. And Ketamin is basically Horse tranquillizer. The effect is like your time perception slows down, but every time you look at the clock, it goes the fk fast. Feels very morphined out, and it feels weird to move. When you stand up it also feels like you're standing on top of a skyscraper. Overall, I didn't like ketamin at first, but after a few times I began to like the drug. But you cannot drink alcohol on ketamine, that's a really bad decision. Makes alcohol hit twice as hard, and ketamine twice as hard.  
Nice try FBI  
How much did you make?  
I honestly don‚Äôt know, not much and I lost a lot of it, at the end I was doing 5 figure deals and made more in a few months than I did in the prior year. I made around 50k ? but easily lost over 20k and wasted thousands more. I do have assets also worth a fair bit, I have at least 40k left in assets and cash  
What is a fun, safe, non addictive drug? I'm too chicken to have ever tried anything,  
LSD, shrooms, 2cb, weed, MDMA, GHB, Ketamine to name a few. As long as you are not under 25, test your product, take a sensible does and take it in a safe environment all of those substances are perfectly safe  
Agreed on LSD and shrooms, but saying that weed, MDMA or ketamine are non-addictive is pure nonsense.  
Weed isnt THAT addictive. I mean sure people get addicted, but grouping it with mdma seems silly  
Both substances are addictive, scale is the difference.  
Would you recommend whip its? You know getting high off of whipped cream?  
[deleted]  
Thx for the info  
It's pretty safe - dentists offices use nitrous oxide fairly frequently without trouble. Since it's approved for medical use there is research on its safety profile for use in surgeries etc. Biggest risks are asphyxiation which won't happen if you're just using balloons (think a mask attached to a tank) and B12 depletion which has been reported in heavy daily users. Addiction is possible. That's not to say all inhalants are this safe. The propellants found in computer duster for example are notorious for killing people in the short-term.  
I was taught that you just die from that, so idk man.  
You won't die from a few whip-it's. I don't know how much it takes to OD but I've seen people go all night on it. To me it's just a waste of time. The high barely lasts long enough to register that it happened, and it's really not all that fun/interesting. I don't get the appeal at all.  
Guess I should be dead then. Do your research kids.  
They are really good especially if you combine with other substances, know when to stop though, it‚Äôs perfectly fine if you only do a few but I have a friend who will do a few hundred in a row and now he has nerve damage I think. As long as you only do one canister at a time and don‚Äôt over do it you‚Äôll be fine  
You must be insane if you think mdma, ket, or weed isn‚Äôt addictive. Also none of those drugs are ‚Äòsafe‚Äô, some safer than others sure.  
Shrooms and weed are definitely the safest of any drugs. They have the lowest risk for addiction, and if any addiction does happen, it‚Äôs only a development of problem use.  
There not addictive like other harder stuff though Heroin, meth, amphetamines, coke. Thousands of people use ket without getting addicted, not saying that it‚Äôs not possible but responsible use can quite easily mitigate addiction potential. After trying ket once you won‚Äôt be craving more but after the other drugs I mentioned you‚Äôll already be wanting to buy more in under 24 hours later  
Definitely try shrooms, pretty harmless, and if you go into it wanting to learn more about yourself it can be a really awesome and insightful experience  
All my friends have had amazing shroom experiences so a few years ago I thought, "fuck it, why not." I  hopped in the shower, which felt great. I then started thinking that something was going to come out of the drain. Then I got deep into my negative thoughts and proceeded to cry for the next 6 hours, balled up in a corner. Definitely a very insightful experience, just not a very fun one for me. So yeah, just make sure you're in a good mental headspace lol  
Unless you have predisposition to mental illness like schizophrenia. Not really that harmless in that case.  
That‚Äôs not the drug though, you should know of any predisposition before even thinking about taking anything  
A drug can act as a catalyst and worsen a mental state of the sick, so yeah, I'd say it's the drug at least partially.  
I don‚Äôt know too much about drugs but aren‚Äôt psychedelics in general pretty alright? Non addictive, and are showing promise in treating mental illness  
Yeah for sure, I‚Äôd say that shrooms is safer than lsd just because of the natural/ lab aspect of each drug, and I‚Äôve seen people completely fall off because they did acid wayyyy too often. I just do shrooms maybe once a year, and I smoke weed 3 nights a week. I‚Äôm at my best and still improving in almost every aspect of my life currently, and these drugs can help you pinpoint your weaknesses and instead of running from them, facing them and resolving them  
Yep, just like most things, if you overdo it, it can and will become an addiction. I had a question that I‚Äôve always wondered though. Some say that steer clear of psychedelics if you have a mental illness, yet some say that it can really help and open your mind. Which is true? And congrats on being at your best! :))  
'organic' dosent mean healthy or safe... On top of that weed isnt organic anymore because of how much its changed people just breed the ones with the highest THC contents, this is why weed 50 years ago was completely different. I assume they do something similar with shrooms  
Psychedelics are known for being one of the safest drugs. My DOC was LSD. The harmful part of them is the horror if you were to get a bad trip (I've had like 2 bad trips in my life and I've taken it probably 100 times). Even bad trips won't kill you though  
What do u experience during a ‚Äúbad‚Äù trip?  Never taken any drugs before  
Depends person to person. A psychedelic high can sort of crack your mind open. You're not always in control of the thoughts you have. For some people, the thoughts that come  can be insights about themselves that they don't want to acknowledge, reliving past traumas, or high level existential crisis. For some people it's can be scary to lost control. Imagine your mind as a pi√±ata, and imagine you're unable to look away from it. Once it's cracked open you're unable to look away from it. For some people, it's a discomfort with what was inside, and for others, the contents themselves aren't a problem, just the fact that they can't look away scares them. Hope that clears it up a little. Feel free to ask more if you'd like.  
Nothing more than a regular trip. It just gets to be too strong and you get filled with anxiety and if bad enough, panic

Just decline, despite what the media and police say, dealers/gangs won‚Äôt recruit a kid who doesn‚Äôt want to be involved when there‚Äôs countless kids who do and are happy to get involved. They want loyal people who are committed, no sense forcing someone who wants to back out  An close friends your the dealer when you get bigger than that and are making a lot your the plug/supplier

By who ? By the police?  definitely. By rivals ? If your stealing there customers then yes or they might just choose to rob you even if your not  
Got the dank?  
Yh ofc

How would you reduce  or better manage gangs or drugs if you were the government, a cop, or a parent? I‚Äôm not sure how you could solve it apart from legalising drugs, take money from the criminals and decriminalise addicts and control and regulate drugs. That would go a long way. The one thing I see which is always the same all gang members are from a somewhat broken home and the more broken/abusive the more violent and committed to the life they are. So I would say strengthen support systems for young people and focus on ending poverty. Also make punishments not as harsh for low level corruption, once a police officer has taken a bribe or done something corrupt, they are stuck and just deep a bigger whole. But mainly legalise drugs that‚Äôs gangs main income usually and people die because they cut drugs with dangerous stuff, legalising drugs would solve that Here   What is a fun, safe, non addictive drug?

Do you really believe that they want to win the war on drugs? Seems to be a good money maker  
Came here to make this comment. It's about money. For both sides. Who cares about the lives lost or destroyed as long as the money is flowing.  
They dont want it to end. The gangs make money selling the drugs, then the government sells them their old outdated weapons, while keeping the new updated weapons themselves so they stay just a step ahead, but never win.  
Not to mention privatized prisons making hundred of millions of dollars each year  
I mean the CIA has opium feilds overseas they even use the US soldiers to guard/defend it .im sure its only for tea tho :)  
I sold heroin for 3 years until one day the police kicked down my door.  
That‚Äôs a real shame Got any left?  
No they took it all. But didn‚Äôt find $13k. Doesn‚Äôt matter anyway cause I spent that awfully fast and wasted it  
I was joking I didn‚Äôt think you would have any left I‚Äôm sorry that happened to ya Any idea how they managed to find ya? In case I start I want to have some advice  
One of my customers got pinched and flipped on me. Really shitty feeling because I treated all my customers like Kings as they were financing my life and drug use. Yes I know I was helping them destroy their lives but if it wasn‚Äôt me it would be someone else.  My advice, don‚Äôt start. You will get pinched it‚Äôs just a matter of when.  
Did you ever feel guilty about the addictions you were feeding?  
I do now but more the family‚Äôs of addicts, some one tried to sell their fathers boat for 10% of what it was worth. It‚Äôs the family‚Äôs and homes it destroys which bothers me the most  
Not to be rude, but did that ever motivate you to maybe stop selling to certain people, or at least try to help certain customers? I don't want to sound like a jerk, but I would feel horrible doing the stuff you did  
I really would of turned people away but I was working with a group and they wouldn‚Äôt of tolerated it if I just turned customers away, that would of been really bad for business if we had a rep for not selling to people as well. But eventually I did quit dealing the harder drugs despite that being where the most money is but Yh I can‚Äôt really justify anything I‚Äôve done and I‚Äôm not gonna try to, just give insight into why I did what I did  
And i heard this virus made a little but of a drought out there  
This war was never meant to be won. It was meant to be carried on and on.  
What do you think you happen if the government would legalize drugs?, like Portugal did.  
They would move to other crimes fraud, car stealing, robberies but there would also still be an illegal unregulated drug market I would imagine, dealers and gangs would evolve. Would they still have the same money and power ? I‚Äôm not sure, it would definitely change everything  
Yes, answer this one :)  What would happen to drug dealers?  
How much did you make doing this? My mom was a drug dealer when I was too young to remember, often going to Vegas for a night to sell and then coming back the very next morning to Washington state. We never seemed to be rich, but I was a little spoiled and had a lot of toys? And I never knew what she sold either. So, what‚Äôs the paycheck like?  
I imagine it was difficult for her to spend the money, as it‚Äôs in cash and you can‚Äôt just buy anything. I went from 1k a month to 3k a day at my peak, that didn‚Äôt last long. I‚Äôve also made a few one off 5 figure deals, it‚Äôs definitely a comfortable amount  
Anywhere from 1k a month to five figures.  
Please for the love of god stop making me a criminal for wanting to do legal, taxed, age restricted heroin on my days off, and let me pay for my drugs like I buy my food and crap at Wal-Mart. Honestly, as a personal choice in regards to taxes (not that I have a say as a registered voters and tax payer) I want my taxes, that I pay, to go to anything else but the DEA. I just want to defund them so badly. The war on drugs is a waste of time and tax payers money.  
Why should we have a war on drugs? It was a misguided idea from the beginning, and the more intense the war got the worse the problem became for the whole world. I am speaking as a person who does not use illegal drugs, and I don't even use alcohol. We had the example of prohibition to learn from but we did not choose to look at it or think about it.  Could write a treatise about it but I won't bore you.  
You know that was never the point of the war on drugs right?  
I agree a high figure, globally as well as in the US. Seems the war on drugs is more about militarization of the police and keeping prisons full than any eradication attempt. Just my opinion though, nothing factual to back that up.  
(Serious) Do you ever feel guilty about the possible lives you‚Äôve inadvertently destroyed or taken? How do you keep moving forward? Finally, are you doing anything charity or otherwise to redeem what has happened?  
It does make me feel guilty, defiantly, I expect countless people have had their lives ruined drugs which I played a part in. I have given some to charity but am also helping friends who are addicts, I took a kid in as my brother and I tried to help him  
I think by legalizing drugs you put an end to a whole lot of problems our country is dealing with... Is legalizing it going to be perfect? Absolutely not... But is giving an addict a felony for having a little baggie with meth or cocaine residue going to help anyone? No way.. It instantly takes away 80% of you job opportunities, And there's a lot of addicts/felons that don't feel that they can never come back from a felony, So what's the point in getting sober... Personally I was sober for 34 years of my life, I tried meth one day and was hooked instantly and started dealing, I  abandoning my family, my job, all my responsibilities...Even though I knew what the right decision was everyday I wasn't capable of making it and I blame no one but myself.. but I think because I was sober for so long and only used for 2 years I was able to get sober and get off the needle... I knew what it was like before getting high, And there's so many addicts who don't remember what sobriety is like.. And I truly believe that 90% of addicts can't get sober because they don't have either the family support or the financial support to do so... But that's just my perspective  
Before anyone gets all on their high (pun kinda intended) about how drugs are a bad thing, don't knock it until you try it. Drugs can actually be a grand ol' time if used wisely and carefully. It's only when it's done poorly and irresponsibly, much like the American pharmaceutical industry, that's where you go south. Prescribing opiate based pain killers for mere toothaches or morphine for cluster headaches and then the patient gets cut off cold turkey and left needing either/or to survive with the pain. Then they turn to heroin and almost ruin their life. Or even better, prescribe a drug to treat one illness, then prescribe another to treat the side effects, then even another to help counter some other side effect when that person could have been treated by gathering as much about them medically and lifestyle wise to suggest maybe reducing stressors and dietary changes instead of blood pressure medication when the patient is obviously obese and sedentary. My father suffers from depression and took medication for that and another for the chest pains that would cause and then another for insomnia that the two others would cause. He was all against drugs and alcohol growing up and I provided him THC based products and he's made such a massive improvement in health that no legal medication helped. Now we have LSD and MDMA being researched for depression and PTSD. Oh, I also have a friend that suffered cluster headaches that LSD resolved entirely. They nearly died from their heroin addiction until they started doing acid. The war on drugs is a failed racist effort created by Nixon to demonize black people and demonize anti-war protestors. That's it.  
It's all political, they sure know that the war was lost the moment it started and made only things worse. There are people saying that legalizing weed you would help the various mafia organizations (I'm talking about them since I come from Italy) when in reality you would take away from them billions that would go back to society. If you make something illegal but the demand stays there, you're just creating an opportunity for a dangerous and unregulated marked, mixing that with excluding certain groups from society or making their life harder than it should without giving them support is the perfect cocktail for creating gangs.  If a kid is born in the wrong neighborhood and has to work a month for 300 bucks with no hope for getting a career, why shouldn't he/she sell drugs and make the same amount in a few days? Edit: I'm an idiot, didn't see it was an AMA and just proceed to rant. Well, since I have to ask a question, how are you?  
Don't you think drug use and drug selling is also a CAUSE of broken homes, not just a RESULT of broken homes?  
Mainly a result and chances are someone from a broken home is more likely to become an addict than someone who‚Äôs not. Broken homes are the gun and drug dealing is the bullets. You can‚Äôt takeaway drug dealing but you can try and fix some broken homes  
Why not both? Alot of people use recreationally and they come from very nice households, but drugs can also ruin lives. If anything I think it's more of a mental health thing.  
one problem with governments they treat everything as a war, that's not a solution to anything but war and economics. If we have learned nothing in the last hundred years we should look back and see what we did in the two prior centuries. The disease was treated as a medical issue, Homelessness as a social problem, civil disobedience was an ethics problem. Not saying we should bring back stocks in the town square but I am saying we need to return to teaching basic respect and accountability, as well as humanity and community. We can't win wars that are not really wars. When we try this approach we only cause more loss of life money and harmony.  
Agreed.  Been thinking about something I read a week or so ago, idr where,  but the gist was this: What are ur thoughts about how it would impact the illicit drug trade in general (all the way from the little guy down the lane who deals in grams and ounces, & up to the big dogs in SAmerica who control the supply) ‚ÄîIF governments, (esp America, since we‚Äôre such ravenous consumers) were to turn  into a completely cashless society?  No more fiat (paper) currency..  A lot of ppl think it would cripple the dope trade... what are ur thoughts? You think it would it still thrive??  
Have you ever sold drugs on the deep web, and if so how did the transaction go?  
I agree. I don‚Äôt really know how I feel about legalizing powerful drugs like heroin. I‚Äôm not sure how you use it but if you inject it, let‚Äôs say someone gets some legally, then jabs someone randomly, sure they would feel good but what about afterward? I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is that legalizing strong drugs could backfire? Having said that; I‚Äôve smoked weed and why it wasn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd smoke every day, I prefer herbal cigarettes, I think it‚Äôs disgustinghow you‚Äôre put behind bars for years just because you have weed on you.  
When people talk about legalising drugs such as heroin, they don‚Äôt mean you can just buy it at Petrol stations, heroin would be prescription only, given in limited quantities and I guess you would have to prove you are an addict ? That‚Äôs the most extreme form of legalisation.  In Portugal they just decriminalised personal use and it worked really well and then they invested the policing money into rehabs and education and it virtually stoped their heroin epidemic  
That's because it isn't a war on drugs,  it's a war on class and race.  
And anchovies. Don‚Äôt you dare forget about anchovies.  
have you ever cheated someone or sold someone drugs cut with something?  
I‚Äôve cut drugs down but everyone does, I‚Äôm generally honest about purity though. I was a drug dealer not a con man  
I had a friend who used to deal drugs and do other assortments of things. He came out of school with really good grades and had UE. However he mixed with the wrong people and dropped out and began the cycle on offending in the judicial system in New Zealand until they started the rehab process. What do you think would prevent people from mixing with the wrong people? How do we prevent people from mixing with the druggies and the gangs?  
It‚Äôs difficult but make sure someone has all the necessities they need and have no real need to escape reality or make money illegally. Educate people on drugs and show that there are solid career paths but it‚Äôs also largely down to the parents and home environment, make sure your kid feels loved and valued. Also if you abuse them your either going to give them a lot of anxiety or their going to become violent. Basically provide the best childhood possible, all necessities provided, a loving environment and a proper education  
It's all about money. I've been dealing aswell. When you get caught, you will get a fine, they will seize what ever you have, cash, drugs and so on and so forth. And last but not least they will take away your freedom. This war they're are talking about is not a war. It's a money machine, if it was ever taken away, then what should the police be doing? They will never win the war, because if they wanted to, they could.  
For me, having a firearm, even though I had a permit to carry one, and having drugs in my possession along with the firearm. Minimum of two years and that‚Äôs minimum. Devote your time to learning a high paying trade. Drug business is not it. Not only do you have to worry about cops but someone can come along and rob you for everything too. I have been jacked more than once, luckily it wasn‚Äôt for much. The most was $100.  
If you don't mind answering me, what made you stop?  
I made back the money I lost and a lot of people wanted me hurt and police were probably/are looking for me, no sense really continuing  
Congrats on drugs for winning the war against drugs  
After being a lay person I could‚Äôve told you the same haha. The ‚Äúwar on drugs‚Äù is one of the dumbest endeavors ever. We need to legalize drugs and manage them as we do cigarettes and alcohol instead of punishing and destroying the lives of drug dealers and addicts, giving them avenues for responsible use and addiction management.  
In order to win the war on drugs is not going after the dealers or producer, it's going after the user. Cut the demand, the supply is useless. Americans are indirectly fueling the illegal drug industry by snorting cocaine in a club on a Tuesday evening. And they have too thick of a skull to realize this.  
Even if they do, it‚Äôs the governments fault for not legalising it and it‚Äôs not then people clubbing it‚Äôs mainly the poor addicts who spend all their money on getting high. I believe in it‚Äôs your body, you should be able to do what you want, the government have made the drug trade and drug use an immoral thing. Not the drug users  
I've always thought of dealing small stuff like weed and shrooms. Many of my friends smoke and enough enjoy shrooms to make some deals here and there. Is it even worth it for these things though? I do live in Canada which would allow me to grow a limited stock of weed (4 plants).  
[deleted]  
How would you feel if the government did a U turn and legalized and sold drugs itself? Would that eradicate the gangs income enough to stop them? And do you think it could do anything to slow the drug epidemic and change the way drugs are treated as a society?  
Favorite Bond movie and Actor? Did you meet Pierce?  
Wow, that was fast. My favorite bond I have to say which surprises some is Timothy Dalton since I felt his personality is more drawn to Bonds personality in the books, favorite bond movie though would be The Spy Who Loved Me because of the large set pieces, action pieces, and of course Jaws! He's the bloody best. As for ever meeting Pierce in person, I have not since he was always so in tune and intertwine with Martin and the choreographers and while a few cheeky extras did try to go up and talk to him, he was still humble and approachable but was always too busy to have a conversation longer than 60 seconds.   
Holy cow this is fucking awesome. Stoked I stumbled upon this AMA   
Glad I'm making your day!  
Thanks for answering. License to kill is so underrated IMO. So violent for Bond which I like.   
True that. Dalton was ahead of his time. After Moore the producers wanted someone a little less serious and Pierce was perfect but he was contracted to something else. Daltons Licence to Kill was a phenomenal film and and has aged very well, and his bond reminds me a lot Craig‚Äôs bond.   
LESS serious than the Moore films!?  
My dad met the guy who played jaws a few times in Bangkok. He was a nightclub bouncer out there for a while after the movies.  
I didn't like Jaws at first,  and then Moonraker... I won't spoil anything for others, but that movie surprisingly turned my feelings on the character 180.  
And of course, Barbara Bach  
Username checks out  
Brother. I was an extra in Quantum of Solace. It was my only acting experience in my life, and I doubt I‚Äôll ever do it again because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever top that. I was just in the right place at the right time, and I just ran with the opportunity.  Was this true for you? Because it was for me. The protagonists in the movie we‚Äôre jerks (not really I‚Äôm sure they were just busy, focused, and taking their job seriously in their own way). The antagonists were the nicest people I had ever met, as soon as the cameras stopped it seemed like they had time for everyone, and they never acted like they were too good for anyone. My opinion is that they felt bad for the roles they were playing, being such evil people. Was this an observation you made as well?   
Good question. First off congratulations on being an extra in your own film. Now as for your question I had already done one movie and was eager to do another one, bigger and better which was what I relayed to my agent. She was just a doll and pulled through for me because 'A' she was the best, and 'B' she was getting paid so she wanted nothing more but for me to get the best cause a better role meant more money for her.  Secondly it was a more closed set and while they may have came off to be jerks, I knew they really weren't because they do acknowledge our presence and even spoke a few minutes to the extras that went to talk to them, but they always had to get back into rehearsing and studying their dialogue so we all understood. The people that were the real wankers were the extras that take their role more serious than the director. Like they have a small nutcracking role and they're acting like they're the main star, always trying to be in the front of the camera for ever little thing then complain and whine that they didn't get to be the one that gets shot on screen for that split second. We only had a few of those but they were the hard ones to work with.  
I remember those extras. I‚Äôm sure they ruined a couple otherwise good shots by becoming the star. Lol. I had forgotten about that.   
Wow, huge goldeneye fan, I would rent it on VHS as a child and  watch it twice in a row, it would piss my grandmother off.  What did you think your wardrobe ? Do you remember the specific style of cap you had on. And the question I always ask extras: Did you take any props lol   
Good question there. I was afraid that the uniforms might be a bit cheap, but they actually turned out to be too good. I don't know how they tailored them but I remembered sending in my measuring sizes so I can get my uniform day one. It was made of a mix of cotton and wool though and all of them were long sleeve so it can get hot, but when I go outside it would be really cold outside so that was when I really appreciated the material. I don't know if all the chevrons or webbings were accurate but I looked like a Russian for sure. Specific style of cap, I didn't wear like the bus driver cap but more like a side cap. As for props, as tempting as it was along with others taking some small things like the hammer and sickle badge on the cap, I was too afraid to do so cause I didn't want to get caught and get kicked out of filming.  
What was your family's reaction when you first told them you were going to be in a bond film?   
My mum first asked me if I was gonna be the main villain which I told her no but I would technically be one of the bad guys, and I  promised her she will see me at least once. She didn't like it when my character got shot up though, hah. Besides that my father practically told everyone at his workplace and went on about it for weeks. I met my wife in 97 and had a child that same year, but my son didn't first see the movie until like 2009 and we watch the movie atleast once a year now as a family.  
I love this, thank you so much. I always wanted to be in a bond film, regardless of which side. Let's be real though, the bad guys were for the most part, pretty cool.   
Cheers!  
Did your character survive his Bond encounter?   
So funny thing is that my 'character' was killed, resurrected and killed again in the archives. The first one he was killed when all those barrels came crashing down and promptly the building exploding later in the scene. (The barrels that fell were made of rubber by the way, my son always thought it was real metal and they just had stuntmen at the bottom.) And in the archives I was the soldier on the right that bond shoots at below on the second jump take from the first salvo of rounds he fires at the previous troops.  
I was gonna ask what the barrels were made of, I thought maybe a thin aluminium so they wouldn't be too heavy. Now I know the truth  
How many clips did you film? ‚Äã  
If I can remember 20 years ago how filming went, we filmed about over 20 different clips of angles the cinematographers felt would be the best in the scene at the gas tanks. It lasted about 2 days filming there with longest day being 16 hours. Each time they have these shots go, they would sometimes even rearrange us in different spots trying to get the best shot.  
Wow, did you enjoy the filming process?  
At times it could get real boring, a lot of sitting around and waiting can happen while rehearsals can also take a majority of time, even deciding who gets the blank guns and who gets the rubber guns. I always wanted the rubber gun cause that meant you would get shot and would have to die on screen which means a chance of getting to see it on film. I got one of those scenes on film in the archives portion.  
 I always wanted the rubber gun cause that meant you would get shot and would have to die on screen  I don't follow. Extras with blank guns don't get shot?  
What was the pay like?  
So for the 2 or 3 days of filming on the gunfight in the interior of the chemical plant I made around 150 pounds and filming at the archives came to 200 pounds since it took much longer to shoot there then the chemical plant as that had more stunts and blanks to be fired as well as your close ups.  
ISO pound to American translator   
This man got around $600-700 for two days of work, said one was 16 hours.  Gonna assume 24-28 hours total for ezpz math, $25-30 an hour 20+ years ago.     Those estimates are rougher than Gordon Ramsay's edges but you get the point.    Edit:  Shit, adjusted for current inflation, not two decade old inflation...  Fuck it, leaving this here.  
You have to take a few things into account. 1) fluctuation in GBP value and 2) change in exchange rate. ¬£150 had the purchasing power of roughly ¬£280 back when he was paid according to the Bank of England's calculator. But then do you want what it was worth in dollars back then or today? The exchange rate back then was roughly $1.5 to ¬£1, and now it's $1.28 to ¬£1. So, if we are thinking about how much 1994's ¬£150 would be worth in today's $, it's roughly $360. If we put ¬£350 in for both days work to get the inflation adjusted value, and the check it against today's exchange rate, we get $844.63. which ain't that bad.  
Pounds sterling.  Across the pond they pay people in actual lumps of silver, and apparently OP was worth his weight  
ok why are you getting downvoted this comment is funny  
How many stones does he weigh?  
what was it like on set on goldeneye? was it like a normal wokplace with watercooler talk and could you somehow show yourself in one of the clips? :)  
The moments when we had to pay attention to what we had to do in order not to spoil the shot was when we had to buckle down and listen to what the director, stunt choreographer wanted us to do. Besides that when we had to await for them to set the scene up, a lot of guys would indeed go out the back of the studio outside to take smoke and tea breaks and indeed have talks over random stuff. It was very professional work but also relaxed to work around an action movie. I really enjoyed it, and if I find myself in the scene which won't be too hard I'll throw it in the reddit.  
sound awsome, and also, when was the filming done, and was smoking still common then?   
So I wouldn't be able to exactly pinpoint the dates of each segment of film, but when filming movies they usually don't go chronological. Could be like 'We're gonna film the second shot of the hallway in the archives, and then the next day we are gonna go next door to shoot the dialogue between Sean and Pierce on the train set while the production crew for the archive set with some more fake glass on those offices for the next days shoot.' Something was always being done if filming wasn't going on and most of the time we were specifically given dates on when to arrive for filming unless if they postpone or your worst case cancel it. I forgot to mention that most of the filming was done in this old factory which they converted into a studio, I thought it was really impressive. And smoking was indeed still common at that time, production staff and extras all often got together out back during breaks to chat about their lives, how they felt the scene was going, their favorite part, or complaining that they want to go home after 15 hours of work.  
 the Reddit   Confirmed dad  
In the opening scene of Goldeneye, a man is seen reading a newspaper that says 1995 on it even though the movie took place in 1986! I certainly hope someone got fired for that blunder!  
That happened in the movie? I gotta look out for that now, I never noticed that.  
I'll feel this one. Why would a grown man wearing a shirt that says genius at work spend their time posting on a children's website?  
I withdraw my question.  
The lot of the "Russians" wore the wrong uniforms...  
Well whenever you notice something like that happening.......a wizard did it  
Had you ever acted before filming these scenes? Did you have any kind of acting formation/training?  
So I was really really fortunate to have my portrait being selected for Tom and Viv when casting was going out, a guy I knew in the filming business told me to work your way up as an extra rather than seek for the main head role. I sent my resume along with a photo of myself to 3 Mills and even pinewood until I was introduced to an American filming agent named Linda Cunningham. I told her of my interest of taking work as an extra for any films in the UK and luckily acting work in the UK compared to the states is a little easier to get, downside is the film may not be as big of a success worldwide compared to a movie made in Hollywood. But I didn't have the funds to go to America so I chose to stay in England and take whatever role I could get. That's the short version, a lot of harassing and financial things went into place since acting agents ain't free.  
Do you consider yourself a good or bad manager?  
I am the bloody best at procrastinating, but I do enough work to earn that coin.  
Lol this is exactly how I would describe myself as a restaurant manager!!   
You describe yourself in British?  Edit: your name is ‚ÄúI drink tea.‚Äù Nevermind.   
Lol your name checks out   
Honestly, I procrastinate so much as well. Only for a little while doesn‚Äôt hurt too much.   
When playing the part of a soldier, did you work for a military advisor? If so, what was it like? If not, what was your inspiration?  Also, was it fun or stressful?  
So the man we went to when we had questions on how to accurately portray a soldier was an Australian fellow we called Joey. He was a retired Sergeant from the first division who had fought in the Gulf War and was extremely knowledgeable. If we were doing something wrong, he was quick to correct us but very professional about it and always gave an input to the choreographers about how we should be positioned and such. He also really hate communist since his dad supposedly fought with the Americans in Vietnam, hah, but out of the other advisors that were possibly there he was the one I remember the most.  As for the second question, I had a blast filming. It could be boring and tideoud, but those brief seconds when the cameras are rolling and you know what your doing is going to end up on a movie is exhilarating.  
Why are yalls aim so bad?  
If we killed the main actor in the first minutes of the movie, you would be shelled out of your movie and be taking a piss.  
So basically what I'm doing now. Got it.  
Were any of the soldiers in the N64 game modeled after you?  
yes, all four pixels were taken from his face.   
This dude definitely has a mouth and eyes.   
This comment made my day. Haha thanks for that.   
Best comment I‚Äôve seen in a while. Why can one only give one upvote, a true shame.  
I've never played the game so I have to say no.  
I am surprised you never played. Goldeneye 64 is a cult classic. Literally in the top ten best games ever in many gamers list. Pretty bad ass you got a scene in movie though.  
I wouldn't call it a cult classic, it was a blockbuster mainstream hit. Everyone played Goldeneye in my school including people who weren't that into video games.  
Generational gap. Cult classic to Gen z whose n64s are novelties. First console shooter for millenials.  
I don‚Äôt think that precludes it from being a cult classic necessarily, it did have a very strong and loyal fan base and still does to this day.  I don‚Äôt think that a qualification for being a cult classic is that it did not sell well commercially but could be wrong   
I would consider Goldeneye a good old classic, (the millennial in me is showing), buuuuut its sister cartridge, Perfect Dark? THAT was a cult classic.  
archives is a level in the game, you need to play it. üòÇ  
You've ruined this whole thing for me.  
Ya really. Even if you aren‚Äôt into video games, how would someone never at least try one that had to do with one of the most unique moments of your life? There‚Äôs still time OP!! There‚Äôs still time!  
The GoldenEye 007 enemies are modeled after the developers.  
I thought of this question as soon as i seen this post üòÇ  
How hot was natalia in real life?  
So I didn't see the next bond girl for the first time until I went to the archives set for filming. I have to say when I did see her, I didn't think she wasn't Ursulla Andress 'wow' but she was still gorgeous. During breaks, we all took tome to talk about it cause this for some of us was our first time of seeing what the bond girl looks like.  
What were you killed with?   Would Idris Elba make a good bond?   
Well an explosion at the plant and getting shot down from above in the archives. But if you want me to get technical, the bullets hitting around me and the other extra were nothing more but spark charges that detonate at a rapid pace and we were shown by the stuntmen how they wanted us to 'flail' when we got killed which I always thought it was a little over dramatic, but still made it look great on film. As for that, I wouldn't be able to say because I feel anyone with good acting qualities could be James Bond, as long as they remain British of course Hah.  
Did you interact w Pierce or  Sean? What were they like?   
I've never spoken to any of them directly, like I said they were already pretty famous actors and were usually with the director focused on what he wanted from them as well as rehearsing with their own agents I assume in order to remember their dialogues. Though the few minutes of downtime they did have I watched a few extras go up to talk to them which both were pretty approachable, but these conversations never lasted long before the extras had to go away so the real actors can return to studying the script.  
3 questions  1-how old were you when you were part of the movie? 2-Why did you stopped acting? 3- How much you earn being the manager of a furtniture store?  
Good questions. 1.) I was 25 years old when filming started, I was officially accepted into a role around early December of 94' and started my scenes early February of 95. 2.) I've hit that point of my life where I was young, and I always wanted to be an actor, and after those 2 movies I have done it. Not sure how common people might have this, but when I finally got to be what I wanted to be, I simply didn't want to do it no more. Not that I didn't like it or that it didn't pay the bills, it's just that I simply was satisfied that I got to make my dream a real thing and I was ready to move on from it. 3.) I make about 40,000 pounds a year, but I live in London so it can get expensive.  
I love the answer to number 2.  It‚Äôs so satisfying to read. I can only imagine the joy you felt when you sat down and thought ‚Äúwow. I did it. Im in a movie!‚Äù  
Hi Garry, may I get your autograph, please?  
You won't want my autograph, my name ain't even worth the ink, hah.  
Don't sell yourself short.  
Don‚Äôt call him short, and it‚Äôs illegal to sell yourself  
If not for you, do it for England.   
For England, James?  
Buy me a pint.   
I've killed you many times in the N64 game. How does that feel?  
I've never played the game so I couldn't day, sorry lad.  
Uhm excuse me, sir, sorry but could you try to kill me too?  
Goldeneye, Die Another Day and Skyfall (to the surprise of many) were my top 3 Bond films. As a child, I actually knew the release order of every Bond film, the actor of each Bond, the plot, the villain and had a book of Bond quotes. I knew how the villain died in each film. I loved Bond films.  How did they fake the tanks falling on you? Were they just giant inflatables?  
So the gas tanks were actually made of rubber/foam material so when it fell, it wouldnt direvtly bounce like a ball from the groind but wouldnt have enough dense to harm the extras: besides that, they and had a spring tension on the back so when the director called action, we all began to fire our blank weapons and those with the rubber guns would simulate firing our guns until they released the latch for the doors to open and for the foam like barrels to fall on us and our job was to act like they take us out. First time I saw it i was actually rather surprised and if there's an HD version of the film I would like to see my reaction cause I'm sure the first take was use in the film and that launch of barrels honestly shocked me. I remember we did 2 takes on that scene alone. Good queation.  
How does the main character always have unlimited ammo?   
Because he's James Bond! Buy if you want a real logical answer, it's because of pacing. For most action films you don't want to have the main character stop to reload when in the scene the protagonist has to be flying through when the audience needs to feel that speed so they do that in order to keep pacing in the film. I know of some cool scenes that got cut from the film because of pacing.  
Interesting! Can you describe any of them?  
Are you actually in the movie and if so, can you provide a link and time of where you are? Not trying to be creepy lel  
Hah I'll try to find out where I'm at in the film, but I'm in my fourties and know nothing about video clipping so I'll probably have my son do it.  
That'd be so cool if you did. Goldeneye was one of my favorite bond movies as a kid!   
Just want to say that you are an absolute boss for doing this AMA and getting merc'd in Goldeneye. I have fond memories of watching the film(and other bond movies) with my grandpa and brother, so thanks for helping make it what it is. ‚Äã Do any particular moments on set or on smoke breaks stand out? And any advice for a lad trying to buy a recliner?  
Glad you enjoyed the film as much as I did! As for particular moments I do remember Martin (The Director) occasionally came out to talk to us. I don't remember him smoking but I do know that he would always praise us for our hardvwork usually and appreciate us for being so patient for them to set things up, then go about to asking about where we are from and we start talking like he's just one of the chaps. Really cool man, great director. As for a recliner, get the one that best fits for your back. Lots of lads like to get the one with the most leg room, but if you get gaps on your back or if the cushion ain't filling the spaces enough on your back when youbsit, you'll great tension over time and you have a small chance of effecting your back when you hit your prime ages, could get bloody irritating!  
Actually used to play the game on n64.  How many of those soldiers were actual russians? Where was the bunker filmed?  
Absolutely none of those soldiers in the film were anywhere near as Russian ad the vodka martinis Bond drinks in Monte Carlo. Every last one of them was an Englishman, Scotsman or Irish man And the bunker was a separate set constructed and filmed for the scenes of the movie. I never went to the set, but from what I heard the few soldier extras that ported to the scene told me that it was defiantly cool.  
Where were the filming locations for your scenes?  
Southeast England in Hertfordshire, the producers took an old factory and converted it to a studio because they weren't able to acquire rights to film at pinewood since another movie was being filmed there I think. It was a really large place and they built quite a few sound stages and were still constructing streets for a city out in the backlot of the studio when filming was going on. My scenes in particular were all inside of the studio, never did any of the outdoor sets.  
Wow! That's really cool! How much were you payed?  
150 pounds on one scheduled session and 200 on another scheduled session. I've answered it a little more in depth on another question I believe.  
Not to get personal, but what does an extra make on a film of that caliber?   
Unfortunately it's not a living, but for the amount of time and days I worked to earn it, it was a lot for its time. Each scenes I filmed I made over a hundred pounds, I wrote the exact prices on other questions before.  
Saw them after posted. Thanks for the reply!   
I was an extra on golden eye also, I made ¬£80 per day whilst filming but I was a real life soldier also so it was on top of my normal pay!   
What made you decided to stop pursuing acting as a career? How is life after the role?   
I basically just hit that point of my life where I simply didn't want to do it anymore. I didn't stop liking it, I just felt satisfied that I got to be an actor, and be in a Bond film of all movies. Really really fortunate and wouldn't trade a bloody thing for the experience, but when I didn't want to do it anymore I just moved on. After the role though I felt right back into looking for a part, but eventually just left it a few months later after that. I think have I remained, the next film I may have had a shot at bring an extra in was a Liam Neeson movie, I can't remember the name of it at the top of my head but last I remembered was that it was being filmed in Ireland. Somebody the extras after principal photography told me they were hearing small hints of that being tossed around and voiced they were gonna head there after Goldeneye.  
Could be Michael Collins, since that was made about a year later in Ireland.  
Did Pierce Brosnan smell like how you imagined he would?  
I remember smelling others around me rather than Brosnan, we had to get shoulder to shoulder in our scenes, funny question.  
Any funny stories from being on set?  Was there an open call for the role?  
I remember on the Archives they had just swept and mopped the hallway so it would be clean for the upcoming shot when Bond was suppose to run up the stairs, fire in both directions then run on down the hallway to the door. Martin had one of the stuntmen demonstrate to him how it would play out on real life standards from the storyboard and when the poor fellow did his sharp turn after supposedly firing off in both directions, he turned to sprint down the hallway and hit a patch of water that hadn't dried yet and it was like rope pulled both of his feet from under him and he landed right on his bum, making the most painful cry I've heard. We all couldn't give any sympathy though cause it was the funniest thing we saw, it was like a cartoon when he fell, we helped him up though.  And all I can really remember was my agent basically told me the very day, I don't remember the day but I remember i was at home heating up a microwave dinner when I got the call and she told me that "You're an extra... in the next James Bond film." And I bloody lost it to the point I told her I'll marry her, hah.  
What was it like shooting the scene where Bond has to slowly move the cart before jumping onto the conveyor belt? Did the wheels actually squeak at all? Were there multiple takes? I bet that could've gotten incredibly tedious to shoot considering that all the soldiers had to be focused while the main character covers a wide distance very slowly... And something I've always been extremely curious about: do you happen to recall what the intention was for when General Omurov shoots Sean Bean's character in the head? Was everyone aware on the set that in the story, the gun would be filled with blanks? I adore GoldenEye but I've always felt like that scene was slightly cheap, they really do make it seem like he was killed, only for him to magically reappear later.. Thanks so much for doing this AMA! edit: missed a word  
Good questions right there. So the wheels on the cart actually didn't squeak, I'd imagine that was done on post after principal photography was finished. And it wasn't as tideous as it may have appear to been, but we did multiple takes so they can get the different angles of the scene which included on the scaffolding and looking up at the extras on the stairs. On the scaffolding, we had Brosnan actually behind the cart, but when it came to the shot of just the extras with their weapons trained on him, instead they had one of the production staff hold up I believe a piece of cardboard or something else random slowly walking to the right and they were told to just aim their guns on that large mock target and told to keep their sights on it until cut. We did about 7 takes if I remember until Martin got the shots he wanted. As for Orumov actually shooting Sean in the script, I believe when I remembered in the script it just called that Orumov fires his gun after called For England James and then we were to fire our guns when Bond runs back for cover. I wasn't fully aware of the story when I first got the script, but I heard it being tossed around during breaks on set that Sean was suppose to live because he's a famous actor, killing him off in the first 10 minutes of the film would just be silly. But we also had the intention that he would be the important part of the story in the movie.  
 tossed around during breaks on set that Sean was suppose to live because he's a famous actor  I find this detail pretty interesting... in America he was pretty much a complete unknown at the time (I recall Ronin in addition to GoldenEye really being the one two punch that announced him on the scene here). I'm guessing it had to be that he was famous over there through his work in the Sharpe tv series, right?  
My name is James Bond! Hello soilder!  
Hello!  
Sorry that you died :(  
I have a 1976 mid-century-modern teak beaureau for sale in excellent condition. I'm asking ¬£250. Do you think that's about the right price? https://i.imgur.com/pOzMbCj.jpg  
Marvelous piece of furniture, I'd allow price to drop to even 225 if need be, but your price cap is accurate if what I'm seeing is correct.  
Sean Bean: is he as cool as we all want to believe he is?   
Not sure how he is now but he had that presence and aura of coolness everywhere he went.  
How long were you on the set vs actually in position for filming?  
So I remember the longest day of shooting lasted for 16 hours, we were to arrive at 0700 for wardrobe fitting cause depending on the scene we are filming ot could take an hour to get everyone dressed and the actors arrived thirty minutes after. Film crew and production staff would already be there an hour before us at like 0600, but the director Martin I remembered was always the very first one there. Even production staff who told me that they show up at their earliest at like 0530 just so they could have a kettle going would find Martin already there at his production desk with a little light working on the storyboard. He worked hard but in the end he got a great film.  When we filmed, it can go for about usually only a few seconds at a time before cutting and having to take like 30 minutes to restage everyone, reload weapons with more blanks if necessary and other things like that.  
Shouldn‚Äôt filming have always started at 00700?  
[deleted]  
I'll have to ask my son about it.  
Do you want to be a soilder in new James Bond movie?  
Desire for filming has long passed for me so I would have to unfortunately say no to that.  
How was the food??  
So from what I can remember is that some brought their food from home or stores, but on top of their being a beverage and snack table offset, a main course meal usually consisted of something easy to make. They usually wanted us to eat in a designated spot so we wouldn't accidentally spill parts of food on the floor. One day they will make pasta since it's easy to make for a large group and other times they may try a spin off for fish and chips. But the people that prepared the food were not professional chefs, more like just either culinary students on an internship.  
That was my first Bond movie I ever saw. Then the video game came out and cemented me as a lifelong Bond fan. I've watched Goldeneye more than 25 times growing up. It's still one of my favorites.      I don't really have a question but I guess I would ask: why are the voices not synced in this movie? It is especially noticeable with General Ourumov.  
If I had to guess, the directors may have not like the dialogue spoken through mics on the sound stage which might've had to be redubbed through post. That's only my guess.  
Table of Questions and Answers. Original answer linked - Please upvote the original questions and answers.    Question Answer Link    Favorite Bond movie and Actor? Did you meet Pierce? Wow, that was fast. My favorite bond I have to say which surprises some is Timothy Dalton since I felt his personality is more drawn to Bonds personality in the books, favorite bond movie though would be The Spy Who Loved Me because of the large set pieces, action pieces, and of course Jaws! He's the bloody best.  As for ever meeting Pierce in person, I have not since he was always so in tune and intertwine with Martin and the choreographers and while a few cheeky extras did try to go up and talk to him, he was still humble and approachable but was always too busy to have a conversation longer than 60 seconds. Here   Were any of the soldiers in the N64 game modeled after you? I've never played the game so I have to say no. Here   Did your character survive his Bond encounter? So funny thing is that my 'character' was killed, resurrected and killed again in the archives. The first one he was killed when all those barrels came crashing down and promptly the building exploding later in the scene. (The barrels that fell were made of rubber by the way, my son always thought it was real metal and they just had stuntmen at the bottom.) And in the archives I was the soldier on the right that bond shoots at below on the second jump take from the first salvo of rounds he fires at the previous troops. Here   How many clips did you film?  ‚Äã If I can remember 20 years ago how filming went, we filmed about over 20 different clips of angles the cinematographers felt would be the best in the scene at the gas tanks. It lasted about 2 days filming there with longest day being 16 hours. Each time they have these shots go, they would sometimes even rearrange us in different spots trying to get the best shot. Here   Had you ever acted before filming these scenes? Did you have any kind of acting formation/training? So I was really really fortunate to have my portrait being selected for Tom and Viv when casting was going out, a guy I knew in the filming business told me to work your way up as an extra rather than seek for the main head role. I sent my resume along with a photo of myself to 3 Mills and even pinewood until I was introduced to an American filming agent named Linda Cunningham. I told her of my interest of taking work as an extra for any films in the UK and luckily acting work in the UK compared to the states is a little easier to get, downside is the film may not be as big of a success worldwide compared to a movie made in Hollywood. But I didn't have the funds to go to America so I chose to stay in England and take whatever role I could get. That's the short version, a lot of harassing and financial things went into place since acting agents ain't free. Here   What was the pay like? So for the 2 or 3 days of filming on the gunfight in the interior of the chemical plant I made around 150 pounds and filming at the archives came to 200 pounds since it took much longer to shoot there then the chemical plant as that had more stunts and blanks to be fired as well as your close ups. Here   Hi Garry, may I get your autograph, please? You won't want my autograph, my name ain't even worth the ink, hah. Here   Do you consider yourself a good or bad manager? I am the bloody best at procrastinating, but I do enough work to earn that coin. Here   what was it like on set on goldeneye? was it like a normal wokplace with watercooler talk and could you somehow show yourself in one of the clips? :) The moments when we had to pay attention to what we had to do in order not to spoil the shot was when we had to buckle down and listen to what the director, stunt choreographer wanted us to do. Besides that when we had to await for them to set the scene up, a lot of guys would indeed go out the back of the studio outside to take smoke and tea breaks and indeed have talks over random stuff. It was very professional work but also relaxed to work around an action movie. I really enjoyed it, and if I find myself in the scene which won't be too hard I'll throw it in the reddit. Here   What were you killed with?   Would Idris Elba make a good bond? Well an explosion at the plant and getting shot down from above in the archives. But if you want me to get technical, the bullets hitting around me and the other extra were nothing more but spark charges that detonate at a rapid pace and we were shown by the stuntmen how they wanted us to 'flail' when we got killed which I always thought it was a little over dramatic, but still made it look great on film.  As for that, I wouldn't be able to say because I feel anyone with good acting qualities could be James Bond, as long as they remain British of course Hah. Here   Did you interact w Pierce or  Sean? What were they like? I've never spoken to any of them directly, like I said they were already pretty famous actors and were usually with the director focused on what he wanted from them as well as rehearsing with their own agents I assume in order to remember their dialogues. Though the few minutes of downtime they did have I watched a few extras go up to talk to them which both were pretty approachable, but these conversations never lasted long before the extras had to go away so the real actors can return to studying the script. Here   Are you actually in the movie and if so, can you provide a link and time of where you are?  Not trying to be creepy lel Hah I'll try to find out where I'm at in the film, but I'm in my fourties and know nothing about video clipping so I'll probably have my son do it. Here   When playing the part of a soldier, did you work for a military advisor? If so, what was it like? If not, what was your inspiration?  Also, was it fun or stressful? So the man we went to when we had questions on how to accurately portray a soldier was an Australian fellow we called Joey. He was a retired Sergeant from the first division who had fought in the Gulf War and was extremely knowledgeable. If we were doing something wrong, he was quick to correct us but very professional about it and always gave an input to the choreographers about how we should be positioned and such. He also really hate communist since his dad supposedly fought with the Americans in Vietnam, hah, but out of the other advisors that were possibly there he was the one I remember the most.  As for the second question, I had a blast filming. It could be boring and tideoud, but those brief seconds when the cameras are rolling and you know what your doing is going to end up on a movie is exhilarating. Here    Source  
Ha I was an extra in this film too! I was a Russian soldier also, I was in the second jeep to enter the tank park.  I also was the driver of the white taxi that goes past when they hit the car engine with the sledge hammer!    
Did you receive any training on how to avoid hitting anyone with a firearm?  
With the blank guns, we were given more of a firearms safety lecture rather than an actual shooting class. Simple training like don't aim the gun at anything you don't intend to shoot or if the script doesn't call for it, always only charge the weapon when the director called for it which meant we were ready to film.  
I honestly didn't expect a serious reply to my snark about bad guys always missing the protagonist, lol. Thanks for answering, tho. How much time did you spend on/near an active set compared to things such as training, practice, transportation, etc? Is this ratio different from that of the main cast?  
So I'd arrive at like early morning to catch the tea and pastries that'll be waiting for us at the wardrobe department, the set was a converted old rolls Royce factory I believe if my memory serves me true so there wasn't really any transportation that needed to be done unless if we were bringing things from one set to another. We had to provide for our own transportation, but I knew lads who often carpooled together to set. I spend 2 days filming which included rehearsals with filming going on at the sides and showing how the guns work or how to stand in a correct firing posture. Longest day I remember was about 16 hours. And then around 4 or 5 days at the archives set, wanted to be their just about everyday in case they needed me, wanted as much screentime as possible.  
How does it feel being an extra in a movie as your greatest accomplishment in life?  
An extrodinary feeling. The way I saw it, I was an actor, I was in movies and only 25 years old! My mates were either in the military or still going through school and living with their parents and I was living on my own and acting in films. Such a humbling and wonderful time.  
[deleted]  
Aside from a few different notices of scenes being used like one take I can point out was the third take and the next scene being the first take, besides that though Martin had the storyboard usually already drawn out and knew in his head how it was gonna go on film.  
One of my favourite movies ever. No question, just wanted to say thanks for being a part of it.  
[deleted]  
No I've never personally went up to them and talk to them, I saw others do it but those conversations never lasted long. Seeing the next bond though and the set piece of those action elements I knew it was going to be a great movie. And no the gas tanks were actually made of a rubber/foam material, completely harmless.  
How did you get the role?? Ive been thinking about trying acting and don‚Äôt know where to start.   
Back then, we didn't have things like facebook or MySpace, hell the bloody internet was still a new concept so I had to send everything about me and several portrait photos to casting departments to several studios on top of making many phonecalls as well as acquiring references from acting coaches to be signed on these resumes I sent until eventually I was connected to an agent. You don't go to a movie and ask for an application to play in the film otherwise everyone would be doing it, you have to go through your agent and it's up to him or her to get you in a movie.   
Any relation to Sir Walter Raleigh?  
Haha if I find out I will let you know.  
Joe Rogan claimed people who want to become actors do so because they seek the attention they never received as a child. Would you agree?  
Not entirely because I had a fine upbringing, i can't speak for everyone but I personally just wanted to be in movies when I was a kid. That dream just stuck with me until I got older.  
Would you ever consider acting again, just as a hobby/interest?  
Unfortunately no. I have embarked that ship, sailed the mile and disembark from the whole trip, but that's okay cause my current life right nownis bloody marvelous and I wouldn't trade a thing for it.  
How are you  
Were you the soldier taking a poo at the start?  
Can you show us, who you were in the scenes? Or would you perfer your face to be private?  
I've told my son this morning if he could find my scenes, I'll try to get something soon.  
Do you know if the character you played had a name? Or was it just something like "background soldier #47" Are there any skills that transfer between extra acting and furniture store managing?  
Pretty much soldier number 24 or something like that. We really didn't have names for our soldiers, and as for transferring to store managing I guess if my boss ever decides to have some live commercials then I'll have a leg up on being in front of the camera again, but really it didn't have much of an impact on my job now.  
Does your name appears in the credits?  
What do you mean young and gullible? So people following their dreams are gullible? You mean smart and confident? People that think that way are the reason they aren‚Äôt successful.   
I more like pictured myself as "I'm gonna be a big star in a few films and I'm going to be the next top actor that they'll be talking about." Not meaning to be taking a piss when I say that, follow a dream you want to do and do it. I think the best word would have been naive since I believed I could be a big star in under a year when it took me around 6-7 months just to get a small extra role in like 2 scenes in the previous movie and 5 scenes in the next. If you believe in becoming something mate, go for ir.  
Hey do you remember an Italian guy named Mauro? I believe he played a non speaking part as a waiter, looked like Danny devito  
Sounds like you might be talking about scenes filmed in Monte Carlo? If that's the case then I am unfortunately not familiar, I did all my filming in the UK.  
super cool man, loved that movie as a kid, especially the scene in the facility.  If you could go back and do it again would you?  
What do you do for work now?  
I work as a furniture sales manager in London.  
Did Pierce Brosnan interact with the rest of the crew much or was he one of those "trailer to set to trailer" kind of guys? He seems like he's be a really personable guy  
I think this may be my favourite ever AMA. Thank you.   
Hottest Bond girl IYO?  
do you need any qualifications as an extra?  
Have you been to raleigh nc?  
Do people give a shit? I was in a couple major scenes in Fargo, couple minutes of screen time with the main actors, but you know what? Nobody cares. It was an amazing day for me and I learned a ton. I got to chat with Ewan Magregor as he kissed his then new gf Mary, we spoke about the finer points of body removal because I removed Mary's body off the road near the end of the show. Now would I ever think that other people give a shit? no, I was an extra, nobody cares. I tell friend stories, but to post it as an AMA on Reddit, seems a tad much. Ewan was a complete gentleman by the way! Super nice guy who took the time to ask questions and seemed genuinely interested in this old Medics stories.    
How random is that? I just watched GoldenEye on Prime Movies. Making it's comeback?  
So you weren't a regular extra but only did the Oddjob?   
Do you have any advice for the younger generation? I‚Äôm sure throughout your 81 years you‚Äôve faced hardships in life. How did you overcome them? Thank you for your service, sir!  
My advice is to make the most of every day. The thing that sucks about being old is you think about what you did when you were young. Now, I'm happy with the choices that I have made, and I wouldn't change it for anything. But when your my age hopefully you can look back at your life and have no regrets. What is important is that you take care of the people that love you. When I was 79 I lost my wife we had been married for 53 years. Losing her was something that changed me. When my great-nephew moved here things became better for me and I recovered. Just appreciate your loved ones. Coming to Los Angeles in 1958 by myself was hard. I figured out very quickly in you want to feel safe and secure all you need is at least one good friend.  
 you want to feel safe and secure all you need is at least one good friend.  Really great words of wisdom  
My God, how true is this? You just need 1 person to be there through the good or the bad. One person who can tell you, it'll be ok, or to celebrate a birthday. Even if it's just you 2.  Nothing is worse than lonliness.  
good afternoon sir!  first let me thank for your service to our country! thank you! you're amazing!  second! I have a 2015 Ford Taurus limited all wheel drive in my drive way it's the best car I've ever owned, as a proper vehicle owner, we have named her Elizabeth  (I wanted Betty after Betty white but we compromised on Elizabeth she is a queen after all).  my question is, as an 81 year old and veteran, how do you feel about the state of the united states right now? thank you! xoxoxo  
Hello and a good afternoon to you too! As an elder and a veteran I believe that the problems that US is facing is is largely due to the media, it is largely to blame for the problems that we are facing. The media bashes liberals and conservatives 24/7 it seems. I can't turn on the tv without seeing something regarding Nancy Pelosi or Trump I do believe that in close to 20 years there will be another Civil War due to our inability to talk w and be Civil with each other  
What advice would you give a 16 year old in high school?  
If you want to go to college start applying for scholarships now. Do things for yourself, not for other people. If you want children please wait until you have the financial means to do so. Except for a mortgage try to avoid car loans. They have changed in the 60 years and I don't think that buying a 40,000 dollar car is worth it. At this point it is better to buy used. Also, vote in every election, not just for president. Pay attention to the midterm election and know who you want representing you. \ Have a good one!  
This is such good advice.  I'm in my mid 30s and am just starting to understand that democracy can't work if people don't vote.  You can't have a voice or an opinion if you don't vote.  I don't know why it took me so long to realize this.  
So what kind of car or cars do you have now?  
I own a 5 cars 1963 Ford galaxie 2dr, a 1965 mustang convertible, a 1968 Mercury  Cougar, 1977 ford Bronco and a 2010 f-150 truck, I had a 66 Ford Thunderbird but I gave it away to my nephew. Except the truck, I designed at least one thing on the older cars that I have and I bought them new when they came out. Because I was a Ford employee I had major discounts back in the day.  
That are some beautiful cars! I'm jealous :)  
Thank you! It was a accumulation of 60 years and hard work  
If you were in a war, what was it like coming back and seeing everything had changed? Also what changed the most in you lifestyle once you came back from the army?  
I was a mechanic, so I wasn't on the front lines as some other soldiers where, but I did have some encounters where I almost lost my life. When I came Back to the US I started college. I moved from Michigan to California, so the major change for me was moving to a place that had a lot more people that my hometown and where I knew no one. The hustle and bustle city was hard. Having no relatives in my area or friends at first proved to be even harder.  
Can you tell us about the time where you almost lost your life, or would you rather not?  
Sure, the Vietcong gained the location of our base. We faced enemy fire and they exploded our fuel tanks.  The mechanic's shop was close to the fuel reserves so the shop burned to the ground. I made it out but I did suffer burns on my back from trying to save myself.  
What part of Michigan did you live in?  
As a German I'm wondering what did you thought of the Germans back than and what are you thinking about them now.  
Most of what I learned about Germans came from ww2. While what happened during that time was sad I have to ill feelings towards the germans. The Germans have tried to make amends for the past so I have no other opinions.  
Why did you decide to buy a conputer at this stage of life?  
Almost all of my family still lives in Michigan. So I bought a computer to connect with them virtually and to get on social media to see family pictures  
I find you really cool sir.  
Do you Facetime with family/friends?  
I just traded in my flip phone for an I phone yesterday and just set up this computer. I know what it is but I going to watch videos So I can facetime my sister tomorrow. I learning though!  
You can FaceTime on your iMac as well if you want a bigger screen! I am so happy that you are getting submerged in technology! I think it‚Äôs one of the coolest things ever.  
Hi! Just letting you know I teach a lot of old timers how to use phones and computers. My best advice is to keep a smal organized notepad and write out instructions to do certain actions. You can make it digital as well as you get more comfortable with the technology! It works wonders! Have a great day! This AMA has been 1000x more interesting and fascinating than pretty much any random actor or ceo who does these.  
Thank you for your service!  What is the craziest experience from your Navy days?  
Thank you! the craziest experience that I had was hitting rough waves and fell overboard with 4 others. I thought that I was going to die but thankfully we where spotted and they hoisted us up. Also, two guys in our squad were gay. I caught them having sex in the bushes. I didn't care so when they wanted to bang I covered for them. We all remained friends and they where still together when they died.  
Oh my goodness! That‚Äôs a crazy story! Coming from a military family (Army) that‚Äôs amazing.  Also, thank you for being a trailblazer for your gay  buddies before it was cool and socially acceptable. I really appreciate you doing this AMA. üíó  
what did you exactly engineerd at ford?  
Steering columns, Brake Systems, and 4x4 drivelines. I also worked on making the driveshaft on the last generation f-100 with the rest of my colleagues  
What type of computer did you buy?  
What kind of music do you like?  
Old stuff, like Frank Sinatra, Nat Cole, Peggy Lee, and the Beatles.  I like various pop and rock music as well  
How often do you see your grandkids?  
3 to 5 times a year. It depends on my kid's work schedules and the schedule of my grandkids  
Any near to death experiences either as a navy officer or an engineer ??  
In the Navy, I almost burned to death from a fuel explosion. As an engineer, I have not near-death experiences. But when my colleagues and were building the ford Galaxie prototype, the trunk lid springs weren't the best and they crushed my fingers. my fingers were hurt for 3 weeks so that one of the experiences that I have  
Hello and thanks for this AMA! Millitary personnel often meet with allied troops in excercises. Which allied army soldiers have you found to be most dedicated and professional, most ready to fight and "strongest" as an army? Which millitary in the world dou you think would be the worst enemy and why? Thanks!  
The English and South Koreans have the best work ethic, in my opinion, they were very kind and where laser-focused. If the USA were to fight against China we would have a hard time winning. It would require a lot of sacrifice to come on top  
Why did you not buy a computer during the 2000s when they first started getting popular?  
I had no reason to. I mainly got online to connect with family across the us. So that is the main reason why  
Any advice for an up and coming engineer?  
Be innovative. If something hasn't been done before try to make it possible. Believe in your work, and believe in yourself  
Machinist‚Äôs Mate?  What did you work on?  
Steering columns, Brake Systems, and 4x4 drivetlines. In 1976 I worked on the drive train for f-100  
Nice, how about when you were in the navy?  What did you work on there?  Or was it all paint chipping! ;)  
When I was in the Navy i worked as a mechanic. It ranged from scouting vehicles to heavy duty trucks  
Thank you for such a quick reply. I‚Äôm sorry to hear about the loss of your wife. Thank you so much for sharing your wisdom with me. I wish you nothing but the best.  
What kind of ship did you serve on?  
For 5 months I was on an aircraft carrier other than that for the remainder of my service I was a mechanic working with the army and the marines as they were short-handed and needed people at that time.  
What kind of computer?  Did you use a smart-phone before? How are you enjoying/disliking the new tech?  
Imac. I have never used a smartphone before.  New tech is hard, but I am learning!  
What do you usually do on the internet? How much time do you spend on it? Why do you think the kids are addicted these days?  
This is the 7th time I've used the internet in my entire life. I plan to connect with family and old friends when i make a facebook  
What were the 1940s like  
I was a child so I had a happy childhood. ww2 really shook us all especially when the US got involved. We just held or breaths and hoped for a better future. Pearl Habor was the worst thing that ever happened to us at that time, we all thought that the world was going to end. I will say that it was easier to have a middle-class life then compared to now. Social acceptance was very bad. But I am happy to see that that people of other races and people that are gay are accepted in our society now compared to then  
What color is your toothbrush?  
[deleted]  
Research what is is that you want to do. Study hard, have confidence and believe in yourself!  
As someone who has grown up with technology, how would you describe purchasing your first computer and using it when not having had it for most of your life?  
To be honest I just went online and bought one that looked pretty. I went to sprint and bought my I phone later. My grandkids help me out over the phone so I'm not completely helpless in figuring it out.  
What advice would you give to young people?  
Vote in every election and don't have kids until you can afford them. In a world where you can be anything be kind  
Who should I vote for if I've lost faith in both candidate and can't bring myself to vote for a third party if they can't win. I'm not trying to be rude or sarcastic at all, in genuinely curious.  
Any advice for a 17 y/o female going into the Marines? :)

Is ford today what you wanted to become?  
No, sadly bad leadership has caused the company to have problems. If there is another depression I don't think that ford will make it.  
Sorry to intrude in the thread, however I do have a question;   If you had the authority to lead Ford motor co, what would be your first orders of business in getting the company back into shape?  
What time did you serve, and what did you do in the Navy?  
Be careful of scams on the internet  
How are you doing today, and what do you like to do in your spare time?  
I read and do runs on the beach.  Also spent time with my nephew as he is the only relative that I have in Los Angeles  
Well, those are all nice habits to have, especially going for runs on the beach, as well as reading, what sort of books do you like to read?  
Fantasy mostly now.  I'm on the Goblet of fire in harry potter series. My Granddaughter said I MUST read it, so I am.  
When you finish the Harry Potter series, try the Iron Druid series by Kevin Hearne. Atticus O‚ÄôSullivan is a 2000 year old Druid & it‚Äôs AMAZING!!!  
"Legend" by David Gemmell is one of the best books I've read, it's fantasy. I would highly recommend it.  
As an automotive engineer, what do you think of electric cars, Tesla in particular?  
I think that Tesla is really innovative. I have seen one up close but I think that the progress and tech is something that I would have thought to have seen in my lifetime  
Have you decided on a porn genre yet? (There's much more options than in print)  
Nah I'm gonna stick to playboy. Don't wanted to see naked videos of people on the internet, I think it's weird  
What is it like to join the Navy?  
Basic was hard but graduation was one of the best days of my life. The drill sergeant was rough on us. It was hard at first showering with the other cadets because I  was used to my privacy.  
how many years did you serve? thank you for your service also  
Do you work out?  
I go on runs. I can't lift weights like i used to though  
Thank you for your service.  To what do you attribute your longevity and active mind to? Good genes, exercise, hard work, luck, etc  
Thank you! I was in the gym 3 days a week and had a healthy diet so that is a major factor. My dad died when he was 83 and my mom was 37. My mom overdosed on percocet with mixing it with vodka after suffering the pain caused from her car crash.  
How was your day?  
What is one skill every young adult should learn, regardless of gender or economic background?  
How to cook, Some of my younger relatives only eat out or make tv dinners so cooking is a skill that everyone should have  
What is the happiest you've been and what is one thing you wish you could change.  
the happiest I ever was on April 11th, 1965 my wedding day. Something that I'd do is go back in time and save my mom  
I have a question about the Navy. I have interest about joining ever since I was 14 . What's it like being  in the Navy ?  
It depends on what job you want and your test scores.  Mostly it's just traveling from my experiences. For awhile I was in the center of the battle so it can be scary. If you get a college degree you can join as an officer. Think ahead about what job you want in the Navy and relate your degree to that or just prepare for the test.  
If I may ask as well. Did you ever feel like your life was going to end while in battle  
Thank you for your service  
As a grand child (me)  What are somethings i should know from a grandparents perspective, about me, my life, my family, my plans my future, etc.? Maybe questions I should ask them, about them? what should I do more of? I hope you understand what I mean, its kind of hard to explain my thought process on this comment. Lol Have a great day and thank you for your service!!!  
Who introduced you to reddit?  
First off, thank you for your service. What made you want to be an engineer?  
Good evening sir! I would be curious about what do you think about the Reddit community?  
It has it's good and bad I think that people here are so sensitive and it ruins the experience especially if people are on a power trip  
I saw your comment further on down in the tread about how your mother was 37 when you lost her. My mother was 37 when I lost her as well under similar circumstances, and I‚Äôm sorry you had to experience that loss. My question is what is your opinion on those who dodged the draft during Vietnam?  
How unreliable where the fords you sold  
This question is going to be broad. What is your opinion on forgiveness?  
What's something you loved doing as a kid?  
Do you have any pets?  
Do u need help???? With anything?  
 Why did you join the military?  Why the Navy specifically and not say, the Marines ;) ? What advice would you want to give to someone who wants to or already is joining the military? What would you advise to people who specifically want to become sailors in the Navy? What was boot camp like?  What was your rating?  Did you enjoy your time in? Why?  If you could, would you do it all over again? Got any regrets?  Stupid question but do you have any dating advice for those of us in the younger generation?   
I couldn't pay for college so that's what I did to pay for it Uncle was in the Navy key factor Be smart and reflect on your choices. It could be the end of you and your fellow comrades. Be sure that you can handle moving a lot and not seeing land for days. Hard, Drill Sergeant was rough on us. The hardest thing to get used to was showering with other men, and having almost no privacy. Not really, I sacrificed  2 years of my life for free college. But I did gain job experience and life long friends  Nope I regret not spending more time with my mom before she passed For men what I can say about dating is don't kick the can down the road. If you like a person don't be afraid to tell them how you feel.  
Do you have any funny stories from your time serving  
A cadet didn't keep his weapon down range and he shot himself. We were all thinking "How stupid are you when you point a loaded gun at yourself.  He did live though  
Thank you for your service, Sir.  
Who are you voting for?  
What‚Äôs your best advice for a young engineer?  
For an 81 year old man you have adapted very well to this new age. Bravo.  My question is, what exactly is a ford engineer?  
Do you now have a nice relaxing life, especially with your new computer?  
What was the worst thing you have seen at ford?  
Do you remember the name of it? Is it still operational or out of service?  
What is your favourite car if I may ask sir?  
What took you so long to get a computer? Do you have a smartphone?  
Do you drive a Ford?  
What's your greatest "What if"?  
Looking back on the many weak points of Ford vehicles, are there any specific or general designers, engineers or bean counters you want to punch for their choices?  
Hello sir! Thank you for your service and also thank you for being willing to participate here on reddit!  As a former ford engineer, What is your dream car? (Doesn‚Äôt have to be Ford üòä)  
As a former Ford engineer, what is your opinion on the Mustang Mach-e? Do you think that an electric SUV ruins the Mustang nameplate?  
What‚Äôs your favorite book ?  
You mentioned you were with your wife for over 50 years. I‚Äôm sorry for your loss, and curious about what advice you‚Äôd give a couple in their 30s just starting out? What‚Äôs the ‚Äúsecret‚Äù?  
Just how reliable are Fords in your opinion, and what would be your tips on getting the most out of their lifespan? Proud owner of a 7 year old focus and would love to get another 7 out of it.  
What is your favorite video game?  
Who is your favorite grandkid?  
What‚Äôs your favorite ford model, do you own a ford or are you loyal to another brand now  
First, cool of you to do this. Second, what do you think was the most impactful invention? (invented in your lifetime)  
Ever see anything... weird out on ship?  
What ship where you on?  
So sorry to hear about the loss of your wife. As a young guy under 30, I‚Äôve been with my girlfriend for just under 9 years and it‚Äôs the thing I fear most in the world having to go through. If I may ask, how did/do you cope with it?  
My nephew was a major source of support for me. I also had family and friends that were around.  When someone dies the hardest thing is to accept it. When you do that things will improve. I realized that I was holding on to what I had and that I wasn't really living. So I decided that I wasn't going to waste away and started living every day for her  
Got any unique stories you'd like to share from the Navy? Thank you for your service, sir!  
Ok, this wasn't while  I was in the Navy but by the time I was discharged.  One of my navy buddies was getting married so he and 3 others came to LA to visit as he was having his wedding in Santa Monica. We were having a reunion and enjoying his last night as an unmarried man  He got extremely drunk! 2 hours before the wedding was supposed to start we had to clean him up and we speed downtown to make it. He vomited in my car. The highway patrol pulled us over, I got an 8 dollar Speeding ticket. In the end, we did make it to the wedding and they had a happy ever after.  
How you doing?  
First, thank you for your advice and being open to freely talk with strangers on the internet. Is there something you definitely think was better back in your day? If so, could you please tell us about it?  
Best car advice for a first timer?? Thank you!  
What's your general opinion about current stuff (I mean, like music, movies) compared to what shone during your youth?  
Do you mind talking about your navy past?  
[deleted]  
What did you miss the most about civilian life while serving in the Navy?  
What is your favorite book?  
What your favorite place in the country and/or the world?  
A few questions,  1.) What's your opinion on the changes in how vehicles are built across your lifetime? 2.) Did you ever feel like working a 9-5 was a waste of time during your younger years? It kinda bothers me currently. Maybe I'm just over thinking though.  3.) What field or job in engineering do you think would be interesting? I just graduated this spring as a mechanical engineer, and worked some co-op rotations with a military sub contractor or I suppose that's kind what they are. It was fun but a bit high stress for my taste. Also thank you for your service!  
You said in one reply that the Vietcong has gained your location, but in another you said that most of what you know about the Germans comes from WW2. That confuses me a bit, can you clear that up?  
What is your most proud accomplishment in you life?  
What is your favorite genre of music? Got any favorite artists?   Edit: Nevermind I just noticed that someone else already asked that question lol.    New question: What is the most delicious thing you have ever eaten?  
What rank were you? What ship were stationed on? And what bases were you at? My dad was a GSM1 (which isn‚Äôt even an active rank anymore).  
What do you think about all the social and political unrest right now? Heavy question but you've seen and experienced political scandals and corruption, protests and social change, etc so I'm very curious about your thoughts on what's going on today.  
This thing still going on?  What are your opinions on recent protests? What are your thoughts on people burning the US flag?  
Have you found any subreddits you particularly like yet?  Which?  
How are you today?  
What do you like about your daily routine?  
What years did you work for Ford? Did you ever work with a Melvin Sterner?  
Hello! Thank you for doing this, I think it‚Äôs awesome to see all different generations connecting online. And thank you for your service as well!  What‚Äôs one positive change you‚Äôve seen in your lifetime, and what‚Äôs something you wish the world would go back to from when you were younger? Also, do you think that your views on life have changed as you‚Äôve gotten older and seen more of the world? Thank you!  
If you were to buy a brand new truck in 2020, what brand would you go with? Curious to see what you have to say being an engineer for ford.  
Do you like any Pink Floyd or Rush?  
Sorry to be that guy, but does anyone else think this is fake?  
How much time have you spent on Porn Hub?  
Hi, I've read some of the comments and noticed you lived in LA since 1958?, I was wondering how it was for you to see the city of angles change throughout the years, especially during the 60s and Hollywood that changed with this of course.  
Are you aware of Memes yet? If so, what is your favorite?  
Why in God‚Äôs name did ford decide to start twisting wire around their break lines? It traps mud and actually causes them to rust at a much faster rate. Also why the exploder? Also why put that heater hose across plug 4 pm the most common motor you sell, knowing that it would damage the coil pack?  
Hi! First off thanks for your service, my dad also worked for the military so I kinda know how it is. Also I‚Äôm a bit jealous cause my grandparents aren‚Äôt very interested in new things such as iPhones etc.  But anyway my question is, how do you think future life will be like for gen z?  
Do you think people changed throughout the years? If yes, in which ways?  
What's your favorite sandwich?  
Poker is a high risk game, I never risk a real stake unless I can guarantee at least a straight, which is at least around a 50%.  Do you think going 2 pair is better for all or just stop stressing and "all in" when you feel and forget the feed from life?  
Is there any social or cultural aspect from the past that you miss? Is there any way to know when your living in the ‚Äúgood old days‚Äù? (Also thanks for your service!)  
Did you get a Mac or a PC?  
How‚Äôd using the computer go?  
Please! Never stop learning and reaching out to this community for learning and teaching! I love get advices from our veterans!  What kind of engineer you were? I‚Äôm a Chem Eng but if I‚Äôd was to choose a different path, it would be Mechanical Eng.  
First off, thank you for your service and I hope you are having a good day!  What is your current political stance and what is your position on the riots?  
What leadership skills did you learn in the military that you brought into work as an engineer?  
As someone that is looking to join the military, what are some less known things it is good for a recruit to know?  
No question; I just want to say good for you deciding to delve into the virtual world. I wish my grandparents would accept it like you do :)  
[deleted]  
My grandfather got way into YouTube lol Hed look up damn near anything but one of the first times I saw him on YouTube he was looking at a video of the sturgis motorcycle rally or something and all of a sudden this ol biker broad pulled her boobs out...the look on his face was hilarious because my grandma and I were in the kitchen with him so hes like trying to panic skip it. Good times  
What type of computer did you buy? Do you enjoy living in the period that we live in now or do you prefer 50-60 years back? Which was your favorite decade?  
Do you think that people hate Trump more than they did with Bush or Nixon or Reagan etc or are the voices just louder and constantly there?  
My grandfather died this Christmas, do you have any tips on how to deal with situations like that?  
Good day sir!! I just want to ask how it feels after living most of your life?  
[deleted]  
Thank you for your service. How did working at Ford compare to the Navy?  
This is one of the coolest AMAs I have ever read through. Thank you for doing this and thank you for your service.  I am the proud owner of a 1966 Mustang Coupe. Anything I should know about my car? We completely rebuilt the engine because it was rusted to seized and redid the interior except the seats because it was infested with mice at some point.  Also, how do you feel about women‚Äôs rolls these days? I am what they used to call a tomboy. I did most of the work on my car with my husband teaching me. I do all the grilling and smoking (meats) and I am very handy. Is it really different from how women were when you were my age (mid 40‚Äôs)?  
What type of vessel did you stationed on also I have a friend who is going to be a engineer in the Navy, is there anything I should tell him?  
Cats, Dogs or Earth Porn. What did you do for Ford?  
Your view on California gun control?  
If you don‚Äôt mind my asking, what is one of your best memories of being in the service.  
What‚Äôs it like living in Cali? Been there long?  
Considering the history of your entire life, is the chaos of 2020 the worse you‚Äôve encountered?  
Hello gord engineer current ford Master technician!  
Did you ever been stationed in Norfolk? Also did you work at the Ford plant there?  
Go Navy!! I work for NAVSEA!  Why buy a computer now? What‚Äôs your fav memory of the Navy? Any advice for someone who‚Äôs 35-45? What‚Äôs one thing you wish you had done in your 20s?  If you could change one thing about your past, what would it be?  I have soooooooo many questions.  
What are your favorite books?  
/u/bisfitty, your responses to the questions are witty and fantastic.  Have to say this is the best AMA I have read in a long time. I must be your friend now. Also, Did they offer you anything other than an "I'm sorry, and so-and-so has been let go"?  
I got a promotion, a raise, and better bennies. I also think I hold this golden ticket that means I can do no wrong, lol. "BisFitty, your TPS reports are not up to par" "Yeah, well, remember that time I was expected to be a slave?"  
I love what you did, OP. Better pay and bennies are great, but continue to work hard and treat people right, and even greater things well happen. There's no replacement for hard work, and ANYONE can be replaced.   
Oh yeah, totally. This won't change who I am. Im a hard worker by nature, I enjoy accomplishing tasks and reaching goals.   
'Hard worker by nature' ayyyyy.  
Hold up, did they assign the roles, or did they just give the theme?  
That's awesome man. Perfectly executed response to the ridiculous plantation theme. You made your point without making a huge fuss. HR responds in kind.  
Ah yes, the period appropriate costume card. Play it well my friend.   
Anything you planned for the party that you missed out on? I would have paid to see you surprise a Confederate officer. Funniest/most clever thing I've seen on Reddit yet. Well done.  
That would be it. There was a super old couple, New England transplants from the south, who came with Confederate Officer uniforms, and were really proud of them. They kept talking it up, and were probably the most excited, out of everyone in attendance, about the ball. After my reveal with the chick in the dress, they avoided me like the plague (the black one) and their uniforms were never seen.  
This guy is making hilarious plague jokes...can we just make him King(the black one) of reddit for a week or something?  
How did the idea pop in your head? Was it immediately when you heard the location/theme of the retreat and party? Did your wife try to talk you out of it?  
Yeah, it was THE second I read the theme. I was like "Really? Well, I guarantee this means they forgot about me again." Wife was a little afraid I would get us in trouble, but we agreed that it would be okay as long as I didn't (like I planned to) make a nametag that said: MY NAME IS: Kunta Kinte TOBI  
Django? Honestly the only thing funnier than what you did was if you would have wore this http://www.cosplayhouse.com/images/D/Django-Unchained-Django-Blue-Suit-Cosplay-Costume-Version-01-002.jpg  
This has been said by many people. As I pointed out, the retreat was mostly older white people, who have not seen that movie. To any older white person who has not seen that movie, that costume, especially on someone light skinned such as myself, would simply be mistaken for Prince. I would rather be mistaken for "El Negro Baggins" than Prince.  
For the record, it wasn't fezzuk who gave gold. My true identity shall remain unknown. cue ominous music XD   
Negro Baggins, fuck I want to see a Blaxploitation version of LOTR.  
You are my most favorite person this week.  
Should made the following name tag. Kunta Kinte Kunta Kinte Kunta Kinte Kunta Kinte Kunta Kinte Kunta Kinte TOBI  
For maximum shock value, you should've made it look like your foot got cut off and made a grand entrance with King Kunta blaring.  
You mentioned you were the only black employee on several occasions, have there been any other instance where you did something similar because they forgot about you?  
No, as I'm SUPER RARELY around these people, in person. Usually, I blow these types of retreats together, because my position doesn't really benefit from them, but they have recently become mandatory, due to poor attendance from the people who do stand to gain something from them.  
I really loved this saga, you also have the stoic face of a man who knows exactly what he's doing and is having the most fun with it.  How long did it take for anyone to notice? Like did some other person notice before that woman and have a chuckle, or was it a pretty immediate thing? Also, what do you think the Buzzfeed headline for this is gonna be?  
Noone saw me until I wanted them to. As I stated earlier... Buzzfeed's title will just be whatever they ripped from the top of the Tumblr posts, of course!  
Can't wait to see the "Buzzfeed has reached out to BisFitty for comment" at the end. Thanks again for being hilarious.  
If they reach out to me with a paid offer I will accept. I have learned much from /u/Wil Wheaton ;)  
While I was laughing my ass off at your posts, how was the general reaction from everyone else in person who saw your (hilarious) costume set?  
The climate DEFINITELY got palpably stiff and awkward for the rest of the retreat. I was CLEARLY avoided, on more than on occasion. Apparently an off color person with matching humor was a bit much for them, lol.  
I had a hard time understanding when you put it on/take it off. It was a retreat and it seemed like before the lady put on her costume, you weren't wearing it constantly.  Follow-up question: were you clearly avoided after you took it off?   
I did not wear it the entire time, but I did wear it a lot. My position in the company doesn't really benefit from the breakout sessions that were available at the retreat. This left me with a LOT of free time on my hands. This, coupled with the fact that I tend to keep to myself in large social groups, meant I could EASILY keep myself from being seen until I wanted to be. Oh yeah, there was some DEFINITE avoidance going on! lol  
 This, coupled with the fact that I tend to keep to myself in large social groups,  One of us. One of us.  
Were there any of your coworkers at the party that didn't actively avoid you, or was the white guilt simply too strong?  
I have a few people in the company I would consider close friends. They all thought it was HILARIOUS and were pretty bummed that the party ended up being cancelled. They were also looking forward to me fucking with the Confederate officers in attendance!  
 Confederate officers in attendance!  no. tell me this isnt real? HOW THE FUCK DID ANYONE THINK THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?! Edit: these replies 3 months later wtf  
That was brilliant. 'Off color person'.  Get paid to write something, ok?  
On a scale of Canada to lost-every-shred-of-dignity, how apologetic were they?  
Is "SUPER CANADA" an option? I am now the only employee who gets to decide if something like this is mandatory for me, I was given a minor increase in job responsibility, that comes with a disproportionate raise. "Not because of this or anything... You just do great work and it's been a long time coming." You know what they say about correlation =/= causation and all...  
Oh man they are so scared you are going to sue them. I think you're handling this very gracefully, you're not naming the company, you are apparently still willing to continue working with them. It seems like they are more ignorant than actually racist?  
I got a promotion, a raise, and better bennies... All shit I've been wanting for a while, but wasn't getting. Really, at this point, me quitting would be as monumentally stupid as them firing me would be, lol  
The job of HR is not to protect you the employee, but the company. This time they failed and were rightly canned. BUT you do have to realize how lucky you are to not have the CEO and HR tagteam go after you and blame you for their mistakes. People regularly get fired and/or retaliated against for bringing someone else's mistakes into the forefront. Hell, in some countries they execute them. People here keep on saying how they feared a lawsuit, but realistically racial discrimination and retaliation employment lawsuits rarely if ever win and that is after thousands in lawyer fees and years of your life. Trying to convince old white judges is an uphill battle, and you likely end up in an unsatisfactory settlement giving you maybe half a year's salary or less after lawyer's cut and no job.  
Follow up question: When you first decided to dress up were you aware that it was going to be the best idea of your life to date?  
I knew it was funny and that IGTHFT would love it, but I didn't know it would blow up the way it did.  
I think what you did was far more effective than just bitching to HR, which never accomplishes anything (seriously, I don't believe they would have canceled the venue if you had complained beforehand, they would have just tried to "address your concerns).   On a scale from 1 to 100, how gleeful are you right now?    
Got a promotion and a raise. I also work from home so I'm about420gleefulrightnow  
This is thread is destined for a bunch of news sites now, OP. You might live to regret that answer...  
As I've said earlier, the company knows I smoke. They don't care what you do as long as you perform well for the company. But again, thank you, good lookin out.  
You are a brave man saying that considering how viral this is/will be.  
You're the first black man I've met that successfully received reparations from the white man.  
 I also work from home  You were 5 years ahead of times.  
What would you have done if your costume didn't phase anyone or they didn't Super Canada apologize?  
Idk... find a new job? lol In all seriousness, I am a top performer in the company who, until now, keeps all of my shenanigans segregated separate from work. There was little to no reason for me to get in trouble at all, let alone get canned.  
Honestly there wouldn't be a reason to get fired either.  You'd simply have had to explain "This was a costume party featuring period appropriate attire, and unfortunately this is period appropriate for me....motha fucka"  
You don't miss a chance to make a pun, you seem like an awesome person to hang out with if we weren't both socially awkward.  
Have they offered any explanation for the party theme, or acknowledged anything they will do differently to be more aware of their shitty shitty ideas?  
They canned the chick who came up with the theme (because she was HR, pretty big fuckup on her part) and apologized profusely  
Did you know the HR chick before this all went down?    
A little bit, not really. She's a few years younger than me... A bit of a SJW, that likes to take PC shit too far. How THIS seemed like a good idea to her I'll surely never fucking know!  
That makes all of this soooooo fucking juicy i think i may have made a mess of my pants.  Another question for you, Did you go dressed as a slave to illicit this response?  Or did you just do it for shits and giggles?  
Getting fired seems overkill though. A hell of a screw up, but still. Maybe it's an American thing. You are the best OP in a long time, keep doing you!  
I'm afraid HR chicks are kinda expected nowadays to take SJW shit too far. The new one may be worse than the old.  
I was gonna ask if you felt bad for getting someone fired for what was probably never meant to be offensive, but after reading this I don't care.  SJW's deserve what's coming to them.  
That really blows my mind. I know saying this will just invite hate on reddit, but I AM a SJW. I hate that that's become a dirty word, because all it means it standing for equality for everyone. And it's goddamn obvious that a period plantation party is never okay. This has nothing to do with her being a SJW, she's just a fucking idiot. Good job on shutting down this stupidity in the most hilarious, glorious way possible.  
Were you actually upset and did it to prove a point? Or did you just see it as an opportunity to bring some humor to the situation while subtly showing your company how ludicrous the idea was? Basically wondering if your motives were for social justice or for the laughs  
Upset would not be the right word. I was a bit flabbergasted that anyone would think this was a good idea. I just wanted to make it as authentic for them as possible, I don't get why they cancelled the party :(  
As a fellow black dude...I love you man. Also, see you all over facebook in the next few days.

Where did you came up with the idea to be a party slave   
I am the only black employee, and I am often forgotten about. The moment I saw the theme of the party, I realized I had once again been overlooked... Im thinking this may be the last time that happens, lol  
The fact that you were overlooked in this planning is probably a pretty good sign that your company is more oblivious than racist.  
I'd say more "unintentionally obliviously racist". You can still be racist even if you don't mean it.  
This is gonna look great on that HR persons resume: "So, why did you leave your previous job?" "Oh I set up a slave owner themed party at a company with a single black employee..."  
"That was YOU??? Holy shit!!! JENKINS, GET IN HERE! You remember that 'corporate party slave' fiasco we were glad wasn't us? THIS is the bitch to thank for the whole thing!!!!.... Naw lady, we can't give you the job, but SHIT, that was some great shit!"  
I loved Fun With Dick and Jane  
[deleted]  
She was pretty horrified. She seemed to no longer feel comfortable in the outfit she chose. She mingled with people for only like 2 or 3 minutes more after that, then had to excuse herself for some "emergency." After that, I didn't see her again, and NOONE saw her dress again, lol  
I have to say, having just found out about this whole thing, I laughed a lot at the fact that, after establishing this horrible theme and deciding it should be period appropriate, her dress was 100% not period appropriate, while your costume was! Well done in all regards. You're a hero!  
You made her channel all her white guilt into that one expression.  
How does it feel to work for a company that doesn't see race, because they're all white enough to not worry about it?  
Before, it felt like nothing, now that I have had the opportunity to troll the fuck out of them for it, I'm walkin on cloud 9, I feel like the fucking KING... not the REAL king, /u/Here_Comes_The_King, but still!  
Feels more like stupidity than actually racism. But how the idea even got that far without anyone  mentioning why it might be a really stupid idea suggests either a lot of every dumb people or poor communication within the company.  
Congrats on the promotion. This whole saga has been absolutely hilarious. Did your wife find this as funny as we all did?  
Oh yeah she did! She was the one who set "Dress Chick" up for the reaction photos, lol "Oh your dress is SOOOO pretty, I need to get a pic!"  She is my #1 P.I.C.!  
Sounds like a keeper!!  
Is this plantation used as an event space normally?  How many "period themed" outings do you think they have hosted over the years?   The whole story reminded my of when Paula Deen got in hot water a couple of years back when it came out she planned a "period appropriate" wedding at a plantation.   I am astounded on how tone death people still can be.  I see that someone has lost their job but the amount of permissions and sign offs to book this event tells me that at least 10 other people didn't see this as a problem.    
Yeah, it's, more often than not, a wedding venue, for antebellum themed weddings... Maybe I should contact the owner about a job helping everything feel a little more... authentic.  
Not to defend anyone -- I obviously haven't the slightest inkling wrapped in a notion swaddled in a clue as to what it's like to be a black man living in Alabama -- but it seems like maybe the venue is trying...? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyQF_7xKIl8&feature=youtu.be  
I'm a little confused with the story. Why was this party at a plantation? I've never heard of such a thing before.  
I'm guessing it was a theme Halloween party. You know like some people might have a party where everyone dresses like a zombie, this company chose to be "classy" and rent out a plantation (easy to do in the south) and have everyone in pretty old timey get ups. They were just too stupid to think of the racial aspects.   
Yes, it was. Apparently now that all the field machinery has been "emancipated," they rent out these properties as private venues for weddings, retreats, what the hell ever. They just wanna make some damn money. I'm not hating.  
it's just one brilliant zinger after another! You're a Schmott Guy!  
Oh fuck, "field machinery" is killing me. As someone else said you need to write a book, or a script treatment for a comedy show.   
This whole thing reads like a skit from the Dave Chappelle Show.  
What percent of the people at the party would you say found your costume funny or at least were not made visibly uncomfortable by it?  
Ummmm, I guess like, the 15-20% of the people there, who know me and my sense of humor.  
Oh, wow, that's actually a lot more than I expected! Too bad more people didn't have a good sense of humor about it, though.  
Keep in mind, that percentage comes out to about 5 or 6 people, out of the 25-30 that were there.  
I imagine it's mostly an age gap too? I would imagine the 'younger folk' would be able to see what was really going on while the 'old folk' wouldn't really be considering the darker side of things.  
Have any of the media outlets contacted you to promote your story? Would you consider going national, or are you not looking for that kind of publicity against your job?   
No, they haven't, and short of some "you don't have to work anymore" payout, which would never happen from a news outlet, I think it would be pretty foolish for me to go truly public.  
What's your actual profession? How many people attended and did no one else see the humor in this?  
The first question falls a bit too close to what Im not supposed to answer, hence the Ask Me Almost Anything, sorry. There were about 25-35 people at the party, and about 5 or 6 of them found it hilarious, those are the people that are closest to my age and the ones I tend to hang out with at these types of functions, I was not surprised by their reactions. The older crowd was NOTICEABLY shaken (not stirred) and was trying to avoid me for the rest of the time there. As more people realized that the weather was likely not the real reason the party was cancelled, the whispers started, lol  
Is it tech or writing or IT or what? We must know something!!  
What is your favorite type of food? Also my non redditor SO wanted me to tell you that she thought this was one of the best things she has seen on the internet. I am to tell you that she admires your great sense of humor.   
Cheeseburgers. Hands down. I fucking LOOOOOOVE cheeseburgers. Tell your SO Im glad to be of... service.  
Clearly, from the images of your hater messages, what were your thoughts going into this endeavor? Like, was it your goal to call out HR and the company for not considering your race when making this decision, or did you just want to rustle some jimmies and get some giggles out of the situation?  
More of the latter. If I wanted the party cancelled, I would have made a big deal about it ahead of time. Thrown some race cards or some shit (if I can find out who sells them). My main goal was to expose how ridiculous the entire idea was, and rustle some jimmies by reminding them that the big plantation house and antebellum balls were only possible due to the work, and deaths, of people of color.  
EDIT: Get your own Race Cards on Ebay Thank me later (damn it's impossible to do a link in alienblue - THERE got to a real computer)  
Did the person who came up with the idea provide any defense of the theme? Also, of the people who came in "Civil War Reenactor" gear, were any dressed as Northerners?  
In the interest of complete fairness, the Confederate Officers did bring union uniforms as well, for other people to wear. They are civil war reenactors, so this is basically a party they have been preparing for for years lol HRAsstDir had no defense, at least not on the call I was a part of. Her and the boss are in the office, in New England, so they could have had a lot of conversation that I was not privy to.  
I kept thinking about the transplant couple. These Civil War reenactors are an odd bunch. They have "pride" about their geographical heritage and you can obviously guess what those two transplants thought "Oh we'll be able to express our Southern Pride, I'm so excited HOLY SHIT HE'S DRESSED UP IN SLAVE ATTIRE, WE'VE MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE!"  
This AmAA has been lots of fun for me.  As soon as I saw your first photo the other day, I was dying laughing.  Go YOU! My questions:  Nitpicky, and unimportant they are.  I see it was a work event.  Did you wife attend with you? Did she come just to the Costume Ball? Who took the photos of you?  They look professional.  That added to my enjoyment of the entire episode.  EDIT:  I was just enjoying a review of your post, and the first photo says "My wife and I attended..." So, nevermind my stupid questions.  
 My wife and I work together, for the same company, we were both there as off-site employees. That would be my wife. She and I are pretty avid photographers. No way in hell she would have given me the opportunity to fuck with her if she let me down on this one, lol  Edit: Just saw your edit after I replied. I WANTED TO GET AN EDIT IN TOO! So here we are, edit on edit...  
I shouldn't laugh but I'm going to because this is fucking awesome!  How excited/upset were you when deciding on that costume? Was the cotton soft? I've never seen it like that. Who's the lady in #6? People's reactions! Did they see you and go, "Oh shit, HR is gunna have fun with this!" or more, "Hey, I think I heard the wind outside. Let's go see the wind." Would you ever wear that costume not at a corporate retreat set in a time period appropriate southern Alabama plantation? Favorite brand of coffee?   
1) I probably could not have been more excited! The only thing that made me happier, was finding the pieces to my costume for onder $20! 2) First person to ask this one! While the cotten if kind of soft, its not like you are used to. It was a little scratchy, and the seeds arer big and sharp, I can honestly see why they could not pay anyone enough to pick the shit. 3) The woman in #6 is one of the few people who knew what I was doing ahead of time. She is a really good friend of ours, and has akick ass sense of humor. That old lady is a fuckin trip! 4) Reactions were mixed, but overall uncomfortable. A couple people (my closest friends in the company) loved it and were looking forward to seeing how uncomfortable it would make the older crowd. 5) Mayble, lol... idk... Satan's pretty cool! 6) I'll drink any coffee, but my favorite is currently the whole bean Kona I get from The Fresh Market. Great questions!  
You're the type of dude I'd take selfies with haha. Wish you were around when I dressed up as a railroad worker (I'm Asian). Not sure people got the joke. Stay awesome man and have a great week!  
How much longer do you see yourself milking this?   
Solely depends on how long people keep asking me to do things. I posted the complete album because it was requested, dozens of times. I posted an AMA, because, again, I was asked to. When exactly should the "Most Deliveringest OP" stop delivering?  
When you're dead. You set the precedent.   
What was the workplace like after the costume party? Weird stares all around or people just acting like nothing ever happened?  
Party was cancelled "due to weather"... A few people didn't believe it before, now noone believes that is why it was cancelled, lol. I was kind of treated like a leper for the rest of the day, so a win for socially awkward me!  
[deleted]  
Fucking lost it on the last sentence. Bravo sir, bravo, lol  
When you heard about the setting for the party, were you offended at all and then decided to dress up as protest? Or did you just think I'm gonna have fun with this and make it hilarious?  
Not offended, just incredulous that they would think it was a good idea. I didn't plan on getting the party cancelled, I just wanted to rustle some jimmies, lol  
Does this gif portray how you're feeling after this adventure? http://i.imgur.com/akiCvCK.gif  
You'll never see this I guess - but you're the kind of person that makes me visit this place every day - god bless you!  
So, what's it like to really squeeze out every ounce of karma out of this? I mean it man, you really know how to get every last bit out of this. Good on you.  
I'm just doing what comes naturally!  
Keep going and we'll let you live in the big house /r/CenturyClub  
PC principal would be having a field day with this...... congrats southpark will some how parody your life!!!  
It‚Äôs been 6 years now and this may go viral again because of another Reddit post making rounds on social media about a plantation farm wedding posted by a poc maid of honor and your moment here keeps getting linked. 2nd viral wave maybe ü§î  
Would you dress up as an inmate if they asked for modern period costume?  
No, I would dress as the President of the mother fucking free world!... you damn racist -.-  
Number 1: We've got this guy BisFitty.   Number 2: He's got a higher IQ than ANY MAN ALIVE.  and Number 3: He's going to fix EVERYTHING.  
Was there any mention of Reddit or Imgur at the meeting?   
Nope. They were actually REALLY careful not to level any blame in my direction, lol  
Obviously non of it was your fault. I was just wondering if the fallout came directly from the party, or if someone at your company saw the reddit post and snitched. Then again, they would actually have to have remembered you, which apparently they can't.  Just in case, you may want to clean up your submission history, you have a very obvious love of trees that could bite you in the ass if a certain assistant HR is looking for revenge.   
Well, How'd the conference call go?  
So, what kind of package are they offering you to keep your mouth shut?  
Promotion, raise, better bennies... Though, they assure me NONE of this has anything to do with this weekend... Riiiiiiiight  
[deleted]  
If I worked in the office, with all those people, I would 100% agree with you, and would be looking for another place of employment. As it stands, I still work from home, and make more money doing so, so, I'm pretty happy with it. Lot's of people are in the right place at the right time to luck up and get a "free extra level" in life. I guess this was mine! :) My wife and I now have a lot more free time on our hands lately, so we have decided to use this opportunity to start learning how to code from home. Hopefully this will all be the start of great things for us, and we will soon be able to realize our dream of moving out west! :-D  
Who took the pictures? Did you bring anyone? What did they dress up as?  
I actually love you for these posts   
[deleted]  
 Idk, it probably would have blown my mind even more than when the stupid location+theme was announced. She was going to dress as "Massa's Wife," but the party got cancelled. (She's white)   
Was the lady in the dress the assistant director HR?   
If you do get fired, will we end up seeing you in r/legaladvice?  
How's the atmosphere at work? Is everyone uncomfortable and trying to avoid you, or is everything normal?  
I work from home. The atmosphere is thick with smoke, so I would say things are back to normal, lol  
Dude, you win.   Also, thank you for doing this.  Made my day.  
[deleted]  
10 whip sized masters. I'd just crush them under my shoe... ohwaitIdon'thaveany  
Is the company attempting to cover their asses after this (potential, since we don't know the name of the company) PR fiasco?  I can't imagine they can be upset with you for following their dress code, even if it was a little too literal and real than they were expecting.  Serves them right, really.  A giant period party on a plantation?  Surely someone must have thought that was a bad idea. I applaud your bravery!  I doubt I'd have the guts to go through with something like this if I'd been you.  How the hell'd you stuff those giant balls of yours into those trousers?  
I love the fact that THEY threw a plantation play and acted like YOU were the one being raciest. Party one BisFitty.  
I hope this isn't too late for an answer, but you were at this conference with colleagues for at least 2-3 days before the party event, and none of your colleagues  cottoned on that the party was even slightly inappropriate? And those 2 gentlemen with confederate uniforms bragged about their costumes while you were within eyesight? Wow. Even as an Australian I could see all the wrong. Ps. I followed this from your first post and absolutely love your sense of humour. You sure you aren't part Aussie?   
For most of the conference, I was either in my room, of off on some remote part of the property chillin with Reddit. My job doesn't really benefit from most of the things that were available at the retreat as I am an off site employee. My wife and I both work together on 100% of the projects we do. Because of this, only one of us is really needed at anything we could benefit from. I hate social shit, so she usually fields that kind of shit. And to the Aussie part, idk, maybe it's because I'm from Florida. Like Oz, everything here is trying to kill you, from the bugs to the heat, lol.  
What the  fuck is team perriwinkle?  
I'm sorry if you already answered this somewhere, but with you dressed as a slave what was your wife's costume? Also, thanks for the laughs.  
I commend you on your efforts. However your comments about 99% of the racism you have experienced being from black people nullifies your efforts. Your action don‚Äôt match with your words. By reading your comments I can tell one of your parents are white that‚Äôs maybe why you have a warped sense of racism and you compare being called light bright to racism.  
"Nothing to do with anything that happened on the retreat" Suuuure!  
This is kinda random (sorry!), but are you going to start posting to your YouTube channel again, anytime soon...?  
Thanks for the chuckles. I've enjoyed you tweaking the nose of people who just don't stop to think how they might be offending other people. On a similar note, you might enjoy this. My son stopped for coffee in Texas during his cross country road trip and thought it was hilarious. Perhaps you could suggest it for the next office party. Texas Coffee  
Sure you couldn't be tempted to put a word in to show some mercy for this fired person? A sacking like this could be potentially life ruining, and all in the name of making her a scapegoat for a fuck up that there was no malice behind, and no one got hurt because of. In fact her fuck up appears to have benefited you significantly. Perhaps ask them to offer her a resignation with a good reference so this doesn't tank her career?  
I truly fail to see how, firing the HR rep who came up with the idea is scapegoating. We are talking about someone who prides herself in being a super PC SJW nazi, apparently it doesn't come into play when it would actually, ya know... matter, lol  
It's also not scapegoating because she had ONE FUCKING JOB, which is to create a safe, comfortable, productive work environment. Instead, she planned a party that incidentally ignited a racial controversy and resulted in a complete disruption of company productivity.  As an HR person, you are insurance for a company's public image. Your job isn't just to not have bad ideas - it's to prevent everyone else's bad ideas from coming to fruition. If you fuck that up and don't catch a major red flag, they're probably gonna shop for better insurance.  
I'd say it's scapegoating because the people above her clearly approved of this idea also, and had plenty of time to see how stupid it was, but failed to. Does she actually pride herself in being a super PC SJW nazi? Then I'd certainly lean towards firing her, but that's probably more to do with people like that annoying me than it being a fair response to a victim and malice free oversight.  
Yuuuuuup, she's one of those whose FB is nothing but links to her PC NAZI SJW bullshit. It's 100% who she identifies as, and anyone who doesn't agree is basically a cisgendered shitlord who needs to check their privilege.  
Are you or were you FB friends with her? Screen shots of any posts she makes about this incident would cement this in the reddit hall of fame. If shes so outspoken she surely posted something.   
OK, you've convinced me, good riddance! :P  
I'm sorry but her job, the thing she was literally paid to do, was to avoid situations like this. If OP was in any way vindictive (as he very well has every right to have been) the company's reputation could be obliterated on a national level. I can't think of a major news organization who wouldn't eat this story up and even 5 minutes of airtime is all it would take to go viral.  If this was literally anyone else, even a manager of some sorts, I'd be more sympathetic. But her actual job she was actually paid for was to not let shit like this happen and she went out of her way to make it happen.  
Bravo for this tread!  
I did a search for /u/BisFitty to find your pics to show some friends, in the process I found your old posts and looked at a few of them. I was wondering if since you now get paid more and have better benefits did you buy yourself a pizza and will you be able to reschedule your Disney trip now?  
Do you think the fact that you're a purple presser has anything to do with your response to the party invite? GREEN FOR LYFE!  
I thought they were all shitty posts.  
[deleted]  
Hey there :) Well, the only thing that changed was how much free time my wife and I now have, since we aren't killing ourselves to make ends meet. Perks stuck, and now my wife and I have a lot more US time now, which is dope af! I have not had to see anyone from the office yet, buy we are supposed to have some other fuck ass conference sometime this Spring. If so, that is the next time I'm set to see them. Since I haven't been to the office (as usual), I haven't heard anyone talking about it, I honestly don't even think anyone else in the company knows about my perks...  Unless they are redditors, which I doubt, but I could be wrong. While I don't think anyone from WORK saw my posts, a bunch of my friends did, which was not the most surprising thing to me, they are redditors... What surprised the hell out of me was that people I don't even know would recognize me in public. THAT is weird as hell, lol. A couple of news and "news" outlets contacted me, but because none of them wanted to pay me, AT ALL, for my time, I told them to kick rocks and that I would rather just tell my shit myself, on Reddit, in the form of asking whatever questions other people wanted to ask. Fuckers wanna get paid off my story but don't wanna kick anything down. GMFU -.-  
This is the best thing I've ever read on the internet.  I can't believe I missed it, but that out of the loop thread today saved me from that fate. Amazing.  Absolutely perfect.  
I love your snoo. this incident was fabulously handled. Good on ya, OP.   
Is the woman you are driving in the car the same woman that freaks out about you on t he stairs?  
Have you ever been in a fist fight? How'd it go? Have you ever had a paranormal experience? Or something that you cannot explain.  
I have, to both of those. The fistfight I'd say I won. This old lady spit on me and threw her cigarette butt at my face so I superman punched her. Old lady or not I'm fucking you up for something like that. She ended up having to have surgery on her jaw. It was broke in a couple spots. Still dont feel bad.  At 16 some friends and I went spooking at the old haunted bridge, go to the bridge turn the far off, wait and see what happens. A light started coming up the road. A singular light, thought it was a motorcycle so we go to start the car because we are in the person's way and the car wouldnt start and then it started shaking. We turned around and the light was right on is. Not a motorcycle just like a glowing orb. We took the fuck off and made our friends dad go get her car. Never fucked with any of that since.  
The light might of been a Ball Lighting  
That's what it seems like now that I saw that  
I feel bad for the lady. Are you a Male? How old were you? Were you criminally charged? Did she sue you?  
I am a female. I was 20 at the time. My sons dad had gotten remarried, the old lady in question was her mother. I went to his house to retrieve things he broke into my house and stole, he told me to come and when I got there the ex, new wife, and MIL all come at me. As soon as she spit on me and threw the cigarette I saw red and went nuts. I may have won that victory but when my ex got me off of her he  broke my collarbone, four ribs and stomped on me so hard with his boots I had literal bruises in the shape of boot prints for 2 months. That was the last time he ever put his hands on me though. The police said if I charged him for that she was charging me, and I would have had a felony charge and I had never been in trouble so I let it go. She never sued me either.  
Holy crap. What a cluster-F. Broken ribs hurt so bad too. Sounds like you did the right things getting away from him.  
So many rude ass people on here today.  Do you play any games?  
It's part of it. I expected it to be honest lol I play animal crossing. We were gifted it when it came out and it's nice to have at a time like this :)  
Totally agree, AC is the perfect game for lockdown  
Yes, assassins creed is great during lockdown!  
Animal Crossing is great fun! Who have you got on your island?  
is it a fun game?  what is the point or goal of the game?  
I can ship you an extra machine I have laying around if you're in the US. It's older but reliable. PM me if you're interested i could probably have it out by the weekend  
Oh my go!! I would appreciate this so much! Sending you a chat :)  
Is this happening? I might have extra parts if needed. I'm in Canada but I keep all my old electronics. I'm not sure if everything "works" so I can't send a whole desktop, but if there's anything I can help with let me know.  
They were never able to get back to me, I have gotten a computer but still have to figure the cord situation out. Even if we could message and maybe you would know the appropriate cords I would need?  
I don‚Äôt have any extra cash but I‚Äôll give you feet pics to trade for cash from men with money. I‚Äôll even paint my nails whatever color they want. But you gotta do the dirty work and talk to weirdos online. Teamwork makes the dream work.  
I'm down!! Hit my inbox :)  
You‚Äôre not gone need a real job after you get up in this jam.  
Weird foot pics & runescape. <3  
This thread.. sometimes I wonder how this app exists. God bless Reddit  
Would you rather get your balls slwoly crushed in a vice or have two arrows go through them. One by one.  
Just crush em.  
Upvoting every single one of your posts. lol Good luck with the computer!  
Thank you ;) you're the best!  
Slowly crushed in vice???? No way you have a pair. Pierce me twice, quick, and with a blindfold!  
Dang people are SALTY on here today.  What‚Äôs your favorite show?  
It's ok. I'm pretty resilient lol I honestly haven't been able to sit down and watch my own TV in so long. The kids always steal it. I can give you a movie though. Recently treated myself to a redbox and Peanut Butter Falcon is really a solid movie.  
Oh cool. I haven‚Äôt watched much tv lately either so I was trying to find something new. I‚Äôll check that out.  Hope you get your PC!  
Thank you, have a good day!  
I‚Äôve wanted to watch this! I love Shia. I really need a good cry movie soon, could that be it?  
K cried periodically throughout, but the ending gives you a really good cry.  
ANYTHING, you say? I don‚Äôt just hand out karma all willy nilly.  
Hit me with it.  
I always a meme or two in my back pocket that always serves up some fresh karma activity, or perhaps you would prefer something a bit more, difficult if you will. This damn dragon bothers me all the damn time I could use someone to slay it.  
I can take the difficult route.  
I will bow to you my hero. The quest is dangerous you are a true hero. Also if you‚Äôre a chick, try feet pics appertenly that‚Äôs a thing that gets lots of attention? Probly get some horny tool to buy you a new desktop for them lol  
[removed]  
Why the hostility man?  
You‚Äôre getting karma, right?  
They dont get your referwnce timmaaaaaaaaayyyyyyy.  
I mean, it takes a lot of effort to push a virtual button with your thumb  
just upvoted all your comments, so hope that helps some lol  
You're the real MVP. Thank you  
thanks! how many karma do you need?  
 I passed that. But I'm invested now and like the banter :)   
oh wow! more than triple by now!  
Also just upvoted all your comments. I have nothing to ask. Just want to wish OP all the best.  
Favorite food?  
Just recently found out I like shrimp, so that's been my new go too! Thank you :)  
Ooh you should make cajun shrimp with sausage, I just got a pack of Aidells? Ardells? cajun sausage and it was great! Next time I'm going to try and make grits  
That's sounds really good!! I love alfredo and make a really good from scratch sauce.  
recipe please?  
Andouille?  
If you‚Äôre on a budget-and you like shrimp....might I suggest the peeled, ready to eat, cilantro shrimp from Costco.  Jesus.  It‚Äôs a game changer.  
Have you explored the world of cajun and creole food? Jambalaya, gumbo, shrimp creole, fried shrimp. Now I sound like Bubba from Forest Gump but the point remains.  I'd start off with Emeril's jambalaya recipe. It's cheap (ish) and pretty easy to make.  
I would've thought the service industry would be crying out for employees right now? Or did the store close? Either way, you have my sympathy stranger  
I was a server and restaurants are only doing carry out here, when it opens back up (presumably) that's our slow season. Thank you tho, hope you're doing well!  
Ahhh I'm with you now.  Well you know, this situation makes everyone nervous, including myself. We (me and my colleagues) got the order to stay at home, but as of yet we've still got our jobs. So far, it's going okay!  
OK give me karma since everyone is up voting everyone  
Upvoted man  
Lol this fantastic. I hope you manage to find some help!  
Happy to help! Sorry about being laid off :(  
It sucks,my partner and I were laid off the same day. Thank you for your kindness :)  
Have you gotten assistance with your computer even tho you're banned from the sub Reddit? Are you planning on building your own? Pcpartpicker.com is a great resource for build yourself computers of any budget.  
I haven't. I'm just going to have to find an alternative route thank you for that info! I'll check it out  
I don't know if you already hit the karma limit, anyway, I'm not an expert, but I might be able to help you. What are you looking for?  
I did hit it but I'm honestly enjoying the conversation. I just need a desktop computer, dual screens would be nice but not a requirement.  
Budget? And what are you gonna use it for?  
I found one cheapest online for $150, I'm going to use it for a work from home job I was offered from my old employer.  
Do you cook with plastic or wooden spoons?  
Wooden of course!  
Ok take my karma  
Bless you.  
Sorry didn't understand how karma is going to help you earn a computer  
There is an assistance reddit but you cant request or recieve any help u till you hit a certain amount of karma.  
I'm running a program in central Ohio to connect people with the technology they need during this crisis. If you can expand a bit more, maybe we can work something out? Message me if interested.  
Of course!! Thank you so much!  
I messaged you  
Favorite animal?  
Dogs, more specifically golden retrievers.  
You got 489 why do you need more?  
You have to have 500 karma. Before this post I was at 187 I believe.  
Do you have enough now?  
I do, I'm honestly enjoying the banter though  
What happens if you loose them do they kick you out of the job. That is a risky buisness üò±  
I'm confused with your question.  
You could loose karma if people down vote your comment or posts. What happens if you go bellow 500 because of that?  
Where on this ball of rock do you live and what is the new job.  
I live in Florida, it's working for Alorica so it could be many different things  
do you like instant noodles?  
I dont :(  
i got a second degree burn with a cup of them  
What kind of desktop you looking for? For no reason at all...  
Just a basic desktop computer that can run Windows and is no less than 5 years old. Per the company's requirements  
I am sorry you have lots of karma now  
Do you need karma? I'd love to help  
What do you need? Edit. Sorry I have a short attention span and didnt read your entire post. You need a computer  
Yes! Need it to work from home  
I just upvoted every response to every comment you made. I hope this whole thing works out for you.  
I appreciate you! Thank you  
What does karma have to do with anything?  
To be able to ask for assistance in that reddit you have to have a certain amount of karma. My bad. Should have made that more clear.  
How will karma get you a computer? Also have you tried asking your work to provide it or at least pay up front and then take the money off your first check?  
I asked the recruiter that reached out if there was any assistance for this. She said that it was my responsibility to have it in order to start the job. They will not provide it. It's a bigger company that is outsourcing for work from home jobs right now and seeing as how its temporary unless they want to keep you afterwards, they dont want to pay to supply that knowing you may not stay.  The karma will allow me to post in said group and ask for assistance.  
Which group?  
/r/assistance  
Posting in free karma subs and asking for votes is called KARMA-FARMING.  That is against the rules in r/assistance and most other  assistance-style subreddits. It will disqualify you from posting a request there and even get you banned.  How do I know this?  I am the head mod at r/assistance. I suggest you cease this activity immediately!  
Like I said, I'm not that good at reddit. So is posting here in the AMA like this karma farming or just if I go to the free karma reddits?  
Karma farming anywhere is considered cheating, and wrong. The purpose of the karma requirement to ask for assistance, is to ensure that genuine members of the community are being helped and prevent scamming. Users should earn karma organically by becoming part of the community, before asking the community for help. It‚Äôs simply the nature of this platform.  
Ma'am, how do you like your eggs cooked. And what's you favorite word?  
I like them scrambled. Like my brain. I'd have to say my favorite word is catywompus. I'm also a ma'am.  
What‚Äôs karma do for you?  
It's not going to do anything at this point. I was banned from the group I was going to ask for help in  
The company won‚Äôt provide you with a computer?  
No. It is a remote job and part of the requirements to start.  
Do you have any recurring dreams? If so, tell me about one.  
I actually dont dream at all :(  
Have you seen this? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=G510jeWiaV0  
I had never, it was a very pleasant experience though!  
The repercussions of this pandemic may be a blessing in disguise for you! With all due respect to the service industry, maybe this is the motivation you needed to find a career, in which you are paid what you are really worth! You're already portraying levels of ambition and resourcefulness right now, qualities highly needed in the workforce!  
I used to do dispatch but I went back to serving because I made significantly more. Thank you so much though.  
Surprised a mod didn‚Äôt remove this, if I tried to post it they would have  
Well I was banned, so worse I feel like.  
How are you??

If they gave you the job it‚Äôs their responsibility to provide a computer.  
This is not true. I have had work at home jobs and none ever provided a computer. Customer service, tech support, teaching English, all I had to have my own computer and headset  
Yeah, from what I know about remote jobs the biggest part of the qualifications is having the set up to do it.  
Must be a region thing. Where are you located?  
Really? The job description says you have to provide that so I figured it was just part of the requirements  
My brother in law works for a call center. They literally took two monitors and a desktop to work from home  
That's exactly what I need, i just dont have a way to fund it right now. Or anyone to ask for help from. I'm really not even asking for the money, like sure that would be the quickest way but even resources on where to find them or if there is programs to help would be cool.  
Ask your employer should be offered. Cuz it will have their software too  
That would be unusual. If that‚Äôs the case, you can probably buy a cheap laptop in craigslist  
It has to be desktop and it also cant be MAC, can only run on windows. Which I know to be true from working there on site before  
Even easier. Desktops are a dime a dozen on the net  
How's everything going now? P.S: Don't forget to eat and drink enough as well as sleep enough bc you deserve it  
Hey! Today is a good day, yesterday really brought my spirits up. I hope you have a great day too, thank you!

Life is a series of random coincidences. Sometimes good people lose, sometimes bad people win. Your past good deeds have no bearing on what will come your way later. Sorry.

Very well. Have a good day!  
I basically just went through and upvoted all your comments I saw. Pretty sure you have enough karma now, but decided to keep going with the upvotes. More positivity can't hurt, I guess. Sorry you lost your job.  What's the max you want to spend on a desktop? There are some refurbished ones on Ebay for less than $100. I saw some on Amazon as well, but the cheaper ones appear to still need monitors. Sorry, I'm curious, did you get your stuff back from your ex? How are your ribs and collarbone? His reaction seems a bit excess for one reaction punch. I understand a punch back but not to the extent I read. I'm not condoning violence on either part, your reaction seemed a bit much for what she did, though her actions appear uncalled for. Still his reaction just upped it even more. If she had sued/charged you, would you have sued/charged him? Now, besides that...  What is your favorite place that you have visited? What place do you want to visit the most? What is your favorite thing to cook? Do you have a favorite book? If so, what is it? Are you crafty at all?  Don't know what I'll do with those answers, but I did say I'm curious. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  
Was it r/Borrow? Even if it's not, every lender on reddit will check your post history and karma farming is the biggest indication of a scammer who won't pay back the loan. If you want to try again, you'll need to earn karma naturally through posting on various subreddit and making lots of comments. And you will also need to establish a good payment history by taking out small loans first. But even then, doing all that is no guarantee that anyone there will give you money. I have given out and received loans, but this is by no means free or easy money. And if you don't pay them back, they will yoink it right out of your PayPal account and leave you with a negative balance. And since you need to give PayPal your phone number and bank account info (and social) just to use it, PayPal will hound you forever for their money back.  
I went and upvoted as may of your comments as I could, take the karma!!  
Late, but r/FreeKarma4U may be of use. Have a good day!  
Would you rather be a rhino-sized hamster or a hamster-sized rhino?  
Have you checked with your local Goodwill? They have might have a laptop you can have for free or cheap. Also check Facebook market place, letgo, and other such places. You could probably get a laptop for around $100. Otherwise consider getting a cheap tower and use your television as your monitor.  Towers tend to be cheaper than laptops anyway.  
A lot of Goodwill stores have stopped accepting computers.  At least the ones I‚Äôve seen in Ohio that is.  
Take my sutra  
Are they called sunny side up eggs or dippy eggs? As others have pointed out, there are some resources out there to find a workable computer.   It is odd that the company doesn‚Äôt have a remote computing solution like Citrix or VMware for the work from home type of stuff as it would be better security for proprietary information not being outside of the company‚Äôs control.  If they had such a solution, a Chromebook would be sufficient.  
Try posting a low effort meme in r/memes. They give you karma for anything there.  
Are your tits really the most dank? I don't believe it  
[deleted]  
It was definitely a struggle, very few pros and a metric fuck tonne of cons. I'll go over the pros firs, because they're fewer and easier to list:  I got really good at basketball. It's one of the only things to do in there, so I played it a lot.  Believe it or not, they had consoles - an original xbox, to be exact. It was given to the good behavior kids when they were, well, being well behaved. Being a suburban, sheltered school kid, I had no problem doing that so I ended up with it a lot of the time. I got ripped. As. FUCK. Working out was one of the few forms of entertainment, so I did a lot of it and came out carved from wood. Not the case anymore, but once upon a time I had a six pack.  Cons:  I got the shit kicked out of me on a regular basis. This was mostly due to what I was in there for, but being a smart kid, and a smart arse to boot, among others who didn't come from the same kind of background lead to a lot of... conflict. My schooling went to hell - I was mid year 11 when I went in and while I tried to keep it up, I don't think I need to describe how hard it would be to concentrate on studies in an environment like that. I didn't feel safe - ever. Even when guards were around, half the guards were an absolute pack of cunts or just lazy, so their presence wasn't a guarantee of safety. Sometimes the guards themselves just made your life hard, because they could. (Not to say they were all this way, there were some absolute champs too) I changed a lot as a person. This is probably the biggest one, because it wasn't just a slight personality change. Apart from all the bad habits and slang and everything else I picked up (I would spit, randomly, for months after I got out), I just grew up faster than I should have and not all at once. By the time I came out, I had the cynicism and bitterness of a fifty year old with the world experience of, well, a teenager. The few years after were spent mostly just figuring out how I was supposed to act.   
[deleted]  
I've had professional help in the past, though it wasn't something I was quick to. For a really, really long time I refused to believe that I had any kind of lasting issues from it all. Eventually I gave in when I started to self-destruct and was diagnosed with Major Recurrent Depression and Panic Disorder. It was absolutely worth going to see someone, it put a lot of things in perspective even if I was the one doing most of the talking.  
[deleted]  
How do you feel and react when you deal with police and other people in authority after all of this?   
I'm not gonna lie, I have a lot of authority issues - I don't have a problem with people telling me what to do, but I tend to get agitated when I'm "told" to do something. I'm also aware not all police are bent assholes, but I can't help but be anything but cold at best towards them when dealing with them, if not outright derisive.   
 I'm not gonna lie, I have a lot of authority issues - I don't have a problem with people telling me what to do, but I tend to get agitated when I'm "told" to do something.  I'm not sure I understand. Could you explain the difference?  
People in prison spit, randomly, all over the place?  Like in the courtyard, or everywhere?  
This is just a random guess but maybe it's done to look tougher, like, this is my territory kinda stuff, could be wrong.  
Did anything ever happened to the people who beat you up? Did you report it?  
It's a different world in there... Imagine you complain to someone who doesn't care, laughs in your face or worse, confronts the offender and gives them a warning in which case they just get you much worse?  A lot of people in prison don't care about getting reported, they have no concept of consequences of actions. They have probably been victims in their life too I might add.  
Reporting people wouldn't really lead to much, except probably getting my ass kicked for reporting them somewhere later down the line. To people like you or me, who live straight lives and try to stay inside the law, consequences like jail actually concern us. When you have nothing to lose and you're already in the worst place you can be, why would you care if someone reported you?  
 By the time I came out, I had the cynicism and bitterness of a fifty year old with the world experience of, well, a teenager. The few years after were spent mostly just figuring out how I was supposed to act.  How did you defeat the cynicism and bitterness? If they are still there, you hide it extremely well.   
[deleted]  
Were you ever raped or sexually assaulted to any degree in prison?  
No - you'll find that kids generally aren't capable of that sort of thing. They just don't have the capacity for that much evil and it's pretty rare that they do. Punches to my face were enough for me, apparently.  
What was the racial make up of the prison?   
Absolutely, stuff like that doesn't stay secret for long. When I arrived, I was told by the guards to keep mum and make up a story about how I'd stolen a car. A few days after I'd arrived, however, my charge sheet was left somewhere for a group of inmates on cleanup duty to see and that kind of sealed my fate. Make no mistake: Thieves, con-artists, murderers - these are nothing compared to sexual crimes in the eyes of most criminals and they take a huge exception to it. I got the shit kicked out of me on a fairly regular basis, though there were others who believed me that helped me out as well. The name "rapist" was something I heard every day, it was pretty hard to deal with.  
[deleted]  
How did you get through it all? If you don't mind me asking.   
Barely. I didn't really have anyone I could talk to frankly about it while it was still happening and alcohol was a few years off for me. I bottled up a lot of it and spent a few years afterwards getting it all out again.  
I once seen a video of a rapist in a Brazilian prison getting his balls stepped on and smashed into dust. Now all week on reddit there are been these cases odd false rape accusations and I keep thinking of how horrible it would be to be innocent and have your balls smashed   
What do you think the punishment for false rape accusations should be? Also, I hope all goes well for you after this negative experience.  
The harsher the punishment, the less likely someone might admit to lying   
Well it was ten years ago, just about, so I can say for sure that things have turned out pretty good. As for what should happen to people who lay false rape charges? I guess the same as the punishment for bringing false charges of any kind. I used to have a lot of really strong opinions about this issue and if you'd asked me right after it happened, I probably would've been happy to see her swing. These days, I guess I've just let a lot of it go and don't think about it so much. I don't really know a lot about her situation either, now or back then - kind of half the problem with our system and the way it works. Might've been crazy, could've just had absolutely no understanding of the gravity of what she was accusing me of - a lot of things. At the same time, she was also a teenager when this all happened and I've always believe that teenagers do stupid teenager shit and sometimes it gets out of hand. I don't think there's an easy answer to that question.  
[deleted]  
 I guess the same as the punishment for bringing false charges of any kind.   I don't think you get it man, or you have some aversion to face it. Falsely accusing someone of rolling a stop ($20 ticket) and raping someone (maybe 40 years in prison if your judge skipped breakfast that morning and the ages of the participants are right) should not have the same penalty.  I guess I've just let a lot of it go  And, sorry to say this, she's laughing at you every day, and the system is setup and probably incarcerating a bunch of "I didn't do it" teens who are guilty and will never get someone to recant their lie. You should reconsider this. As one (uneducated) redactor says "you sound so level headed" - no, it's all to do with application of one's self, not exactly lazy, but we adapt and do the minimum to make us happy most of the time. This wouldn't be easy and it would dredge up a lot, but it's easy to think this is "letting it go" rather than "facing up to it". Don't worry about this comment, the hand-wringing conflict averse subhuman culture of reddit will down vote it.  
 I don't think you get it man  I do, you're just oversimplifying it. I didn't say that falsely accusing jay-walkers or stop sign rollers should be punished the same as rape, just that it should follow the same sort of rules. I'm not so consumed by my emotions and problems with the whole situation that I'm going to screech to all and sundry that she should be put away for life.   she's laughing at you every day  Then she's still living ten years ago. A lot of time has passed and I've come to terms with it. You can look through the other answers for more details, but essentially my choice not to do anything boils down to three things:  I didn't, and don't, have the money to pursue it legally There is absolutely no guarantee of compensation and, in fact, given the stance the police and DPP took on the issue, it's almost assured I wouldn't. So if I did pursue it and nothing came of it, I'd have thrown more money at a shit situation and gained nothing. I just. Don't. Care.  I know this is going to sound like a cop out answer and maybe it is, but you didn't live through it. You weren't inside for a year, you didn't get dragged into a courtroom a few dozen times to have an entire room stare at and judge you, you don't know what it's like. I don't want to deal with a long legal process which is going to focus on one of the most harrowing periods of my life.  I will say, however: Fuck you. You can comment on my situation, but don't presume to know how I feel about something. Dick.

I guess everyone has some kind of revenge fantasy that they think about after shit like this happens, but it was never something I thought about seriously. I'd already been in jail for something I hadn't done, didn't want to be in there again for something I had. Because it happened before I was 18, it never comes up for jobs because it's a sealed record. I wasn't actually convicted, either, so at most all that would ever show up would be charges (still not desirable, but I guess better than the alternative?) That said, nothing ever would.  I did lose a couple of friends over this, some who thought I'd genuinely done it, others who weren't sure, others still who'd been questioned by the police because of it and just didn't like that, thus they stopped liking me. I haven't had them come back and try to talk to me about it since, but that's okay I guess - everyone needs to look out for themselves and I wouldn't want to force someone to hang around me if it made them uncomfortable.

I wasn't actually convicted, either, so at most all that would ever show up would be charges (still not desirable, but I guess better than the alternative?) That said, nothing ever would.   I googled your name, and you came up pretty easily. They wouldn't need to do a criminal record or background check. Google tells all :/  
What changes to the system do you think would help people in cases like yours? And do you hold any resentment against the prosecutors?    
I think there are a lot of changes which need to happen and a big part of it is social perception. I would agree that there's a presumption of innocence in Australia, but it goes out the window when rape charges are laid. It's because there's a perception that men are automatically guilty in situations like this and everything, including how the investigation is carried out, is based around this idea and that the woman is absolutely a victim who needs to be protected. For instance: Photos of my genitalia were take and displayed in the court room during my trial as evidence, whereas nurse "sketches" of her body were able to be submitted the same way. Total strangers, my family, the prosecution, the judge, were all staring at pictures of my teenage junk (which didn't prove anything, btw), but only sketches of her body could be allowed because of this perception that I was already guilty.  
[deleted]  
I don't really want to go into details - talking about my junk on the internet isn't exactly on my bucket list - but essentially they were referring to "injuries" received during the attack. They asserted I had an injury, a medical expert was able to call bullshit. The sketches of her body showed what were supposed to have been the injuries on her, as sketched by the nurse at the sexual assault clinic. Who knows if they were even accurate, but as they were described they sounded an awful lot like carpet burn. She accused a second guy of rape two days before the trial, someone she'd seen fifteen minutes before meeting me, and he testified they had sex in the cinema before she met me - you can figure it our from there.  
Every time you hear of a rape allegation in the news, what do you hate the most?  i.e. do you hate that people try to form conclusions off of finite public knowledge?  
This is actually a really good question, because you know what? My first thought isn't immediately "I wonder if he did it?" it's "Sounds like a scumbag." It isn't until I actually force myself to remember that I went through similar shit that I consider that every situation isn't so simple.  It's kind of fucked up and I'll always have the time of day for people who were in my same situation, but I guess it's kind of telling that I can go through that and then still think that way.  
Do you think that is because of the phrasing and presentation of the media, or you would think that way even if it was stated in very non-sensational manner?  
Did anyone believe you didn't do it?  
I think there might've been a brief period immediately after the dust had cleared where probably everyone thought I might have done it. Talking to and dealing with my family at that point was pretty hard and I felt pretty alone. I guess it wasn't until enough time had passed, and people who knew me could see that I wasn't any different, before people made up their minds. When I was inside, the people I spent my days with all had differing opinions, many of which were pretty straight up told to my face. Followed by fists. I know there were people who believed me, but because of the situation and the shitty system they couldn't really say as much. Was bad times.  
Hey man, I worked with your brother while this was going down. He didn't doubt you for a second. Not one bit. He was so certain, that frankly, I didn't doubt you either - and I've never met you. He's good people.  
If you see her again, what would you do? Forgive her? Give her a piece of your mind? Or what?  
Funnily enough, I did see her again one day about four years back - it was while I was at work and I had a panic attack. It took me a really long time to come to terms with all of it - I'd even go so far as to say that the relatively good place I've found myself in today has been a "recent" thing. If I met her again today? I dunno - I can say, though, that I'd be happier to just never run into her again and let it all stay in the past.  
Good for you mate. There was a girl in foster care whose family moved in next to me a few years ago. We hit it off, eventually went out. Then she started just messing with my head, got into a bunch of trouble, and left. Six months later her foster dad comes round to carefully let me know she'd said that I raped her when she went back home, but that nobody had believed her and it wasn't being pressed or anything. Ngl, it's nowhere near what you had, but thinking about how easily you lost a year of your life, does make me uneasy. I remember thinking if I ever saw her again I wouldn't have any feelings towards her, not violence or hatred, just emptiness. Because if somebody is going to lie about that they're not a person. They're an insect and they're beneath you in every way.  
I feel you man, but it's worth thinking about it from their perspective as well because it can help. Being a foster kid, I can only imagine what issues she'd be dealing with. Not to justify false claims of rape - because, no - but if only for your own thinking, it can help to consider what the other person was thinking. Good to hear nothing came of it though!  
You're one of the few people that I believe everyone should look up to.  
How did she react to seeing you again? And was the panic attack immediate, or did it take some time to sink in?  
I don't know how she reacted, though I'm sure I saw recognition in her eyes. I bailed into the backroom of that job pretty quickly and just freaked out, so I guess you'd say it was pretty immediate.  
good thing she didn't accuse you of eye rape. fuck that bitch. it's good to hear you are moving on and now engaged. congrats. it took me a while to realize that you are a complete different 15 yo that was falsely accused of rape. i was wondering why you weren't a black guy.  
First I'd like to say thank you, just looked at your profile and you are still answering tons of questions.  If I hear a story thats so fucked up, I always think about the day it happened to the person. You wake up like every day, wash yourself, get out the house, do your things. Little do you know that this is the day that changes your life. Maybe one more red light could have saved a crash, one more sip of your morning coffee could have prevented getting into a stabbery - you name it.  Did you think about something like that, too? Like "if I didn't do (...), I wouldn't have talked to her and get to know her."  
Do you still have stigma associated with the court ruling in your day to day life? If yes how do you deal with it?

What are the lasting effects this has had on your life after leaving prison and being exonerated?  
When I got out, the feeling of freedom was almost tangible - I wasn't just out of jail, but I wasn't in school anymore either and I wasn't working. I had absolutely nothing holding me down and it was pretty uplifting for awhile. When reality came crashing in, I realised I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do with myself and my old life was pretty much in tatters. I started work full time and, after awhile, I figured out I wanted to write and now I do that for a Perth gaming site. Also: It should be noted I wasn't exonerated, I was only acquitted - they're not the same thing. The first would require the police and the DPP to admit they fucked up, lied, pretty sure some of the stuff they did were actual crimes, etc..  
 The first would require the police and the DPP to admit they fucked up, lied, pretty sure some of the stuff they did were actual crimes, etc..  So does that mean that you never even got an apology? Damn, that's fucked up‚Ä¶ But good to hear that you've got your life back together now! If you wouldn't mind, could we have a link to some of your stories? Sounds like something I'd want to read  
Do you feel that your interactions with the opposite sex have been affected by your experience?  
Yeah, definitely for awhile after - I don't want to say I was "scared" of women, but I was certainly afraid of being alone with a woman. That's probably the biggest issue, it was a case of mistrust for a really long time. I've never resented or hated women as a result of it, though, and I know that women lying about rape can be just as big an issue for women as it is for men.  
When I was 18 I was accused of rape.  2 days before I left for college I spent my first night ever with a "friend" and when I left she accused me to her ex and then other people of rape.  Together they got other people to believe them and I just broke down.  I was 4 hours away from everyone I cared about in a dorm room believing they all thought I raped someone, it was by far the worst experience of my life. Since then every time I get into a situation where I'm about to have sex I just shut down, run away and it has not happened since.  That was 10 years ago. edit:  I have not thought about this in a while, but it makes me shake just thinking about it now.  
Shit man, that's awful - I know the feeling, about shutting down and not being able to deal with it. MetalSpider below is right - you should get some help. Doesn't have to be therapy, but just talking to people can help more than you might think. Hang in there, man!  
 I know that women lying about rape can be just as big an issue for women as it is for men.  You're an incredibly mature individual, and I hope that if I went through what you did, I could be writing those same words today. If I weren't broke, I'd give you reddit gold. God damn would the world be a better place if there were more people like you.  
You are a better man than I.  
 I know that women lying about rape can be just as big an issue for women as it is for men.  I disagree, but good on you for taking a healing perspective if you feel that mindset helps you.   
Thank you for not spurning this into some MRA/TRP bs.  
How do you feel about this comment from /u/Qbenbee?  Lying is bad and all but it wasn't her that forcibly held this boy against his will for a year, that was your government at work.   
They do make a good point. He was charged for rape and sent to prison for 5 years and he was innocent. Which means there was no evidence to go by and the police,  judge  and jury just believed the crying girl. However she is still a bitch that shouldn't have gotten away with it.   
Well, they're a little flippant, but they're right. The public prosecution was pretty slimy in the way they dealt with the whole thing, which is to say nothing of the police investigation - though neither of those organisations would ever admit it. That said, while the government has issues of it's own to deal with, I don't think she should be completely discounted out of the equation here. She still did wrong, which lead to a shit situation - stuff doesn't just "happen," someone had to kickstart it somehow.  
She knew what she was doing she just didn't care Welcome to modern American women   
Isn't op Australian?  
Was there ever any explanation for her deception? A genuine case of mistaken identity? Mental illness? Vindictive viciousness against men in general in which you were the scapegoat? Does the general public know about her actions? I would imagine there is quite a bit of shunning if the real story is out at this point.  
How did it affect your long term prospects- education, job, etc? Did you end up getting any compensation from any party that wronged you? If so was it a fair amount? Or was it basically whoops we fucked up you and your whole family's life, tough shit (or not even get that much)?  
Actually worse than not getting that much, after I was released the director of the prosecution office went onto the news to say I was still a suspect. This was probably the worst part of the aftermath, because it was my parents that suffered more long-term impact than I did. As for my own prospects, they changed what I planned to do immediately but it didn't ruin my life. I wanted to be a teacher at one point in highschool, but I dropped that idea after all of this because I wasn't sure how it would effect me. I never ended up finishing highschool, either, I instead went into full time work and spent a few years figuring out what I wanted to do. These days I do amateur games journalism over at Gamecloud.net.au - it'd be nice to get paid for doing stuff like that one day.  
Post some direct links to your favorite pieces so we can check it out. If you hadn't noticed there are a lot of gamers on this site.  
How has the false accusation changed the way people view you now?  
I get a lot of the "poor you" stuff after most people here about it - it's not that I don't appreciate the sympathy and empathy, just that it gets tiresome hearing the same thing all the time, even if what you're hearing is support. These days, I don't actually bring it up so it's usually a surprise to people when they find out, though they're usually pretty good about it. At least as far as I've ever seen or heard, I've never met someone who disbelieved me. That, at least, I'm pretty thankful for.  
What, if anything, would you want to hear from people?  
I don't know, to be honest - for a long time I would just get pissed off at anyone that asked me anything about it. After awhile, I realised that people are just curious and they'll just respond however they respond - obviously, I'd prefer people to just not lose their shit and instantly think I'm some kind of deviant. If I had to pick ANYTHING, though - videogames. Find out something horrible happened to me? Give me a videogame. Videogames heal all. The world doesn't work like that, though - just don't flip out at me.  
System do you use?  
Mainly curious, did she ever say why she did this, or why she choose you?  
She changed her story two days before the trial to say that a second guy had raped her that night, not fifteen minutes before I was supposed to have done so. So... insanity? I never had a chance to speak to her and I've never looked for one, so I wouldn't be able to tell you for sure.  
You realize she did it all for money? You think her mother pressured her to do it? How much money did she make after all this?  
None - so far as I know - at least not from me. I don't know how it works in America (I assume you're from America, sorry if you're not), but people don't just "get money" for accusing people and they can only be sued if proven to actually be guilty. I was acquitted, so there was no legal action she could have taken and no money was awarded to her.  
Just wanted to say I had the same thing happen to me at 18, a good 10 years ago now and it fucking sucked even though I didn't go to jail (case never made it to court because there was no evidence). I did end up living on the streets for a period, which was shitty but i'm thankful that that was the worst of it. In cases such as these, what are your thoughts on the consequences for false accusers? My case was complicated as there was no admittance that the allegation was false (just a fuck-tonne of evidence) but I always thought that those who falsely accuse should be reprimanded accordingly.  
Yeah, I have a similar opinion in that people who lay false charges of any kind should be punished for it, just as the person they were laid against would've been punished for a crime they hadn't committed. That's just a matter of right and wrong, though, I don't think it'll fix this problem. I think it's more of a social issue and that we won't see actual change until people start changing the way they think about these issues.  
Do you believe in god through any of this?  Did you get more spiritual at all in prison, or while going though these times in your life?  Do you think that people will pay for the wrong they do when they die?  
In contrast, what would you say is the greatest thing that has happened in your life since being released?  
My fiancee would kill me if I didn't say getting engaged to her, but along side that would be the stuff I've been doing over at Gamecloud.net.au. Getting to write about video games in an official capacity, even if I'm not getting paid, is pretty rad.  
 My fiancee would kill me if I didn't say getting engaged to her  Technically, she only need to file some reports, the state will take care of the rest for her.  
Wait... you write for an Australian gaming site? This is an AMA... Can I get a few unbiased words about what the hell actually happened with "gamergate"?  
Did your family ever come to doubt your innocence at all?  
Heya, I answered this in another question here, but short answer: I don't think so, no more than any normal person would be given pause for doubt. They were really amazing throughout the whole thing, I wouldn't have gotten through it without them.  
From the article it sounds like your parents dropped everything to help. They remortgaged their house and changed jobs and moved so they could visit you. Your parents seem like very loving people. Would you say that having been brought up in a house hold with loving parents helped you cope mentally? Aside from the emotional support you received during visits.   
Are there any counter claims you are going to pursue?  She really wrecked your entire family financially and emotionally.  
She did and it's something we pursued, but ultimately it'll never happen. Without going into a huge amount of detail, it would still cost us more to go after her and it's a very slim chance of anything happening (especially now, ten years later.) Additionally, the cops and prosecution would never admit to having fucked up, so there's that. It's a shitty reality of the system that stuff like this is easy to inflict on someone, but recourse when it's proven to be bullshit isn't really an option for those on the receiving end.  
Why wasn't the Banksia juvenile detention centre accountable for you getting bashed up constantly? I can understand awaiting trial for a year, but putting you specifically in danger seems recklessness by the state.  
Why did you lie to the police and say that you had never met her before when in fact you had?   
I get this a lot and the answer is pretty simple: I was fucking terrified. Sometimes people don't get that and look for another reason, but that's honestly it - I'd never dealt with the police before, I knew that I was being questioned about something and they weren't telling me everything so I had no idea what to think. In my teenage mind, putting as much distance between the situation and myself was the sensible option.  
Just wanted to ask if and how you think things would have gone differently if you didn't lie in that initial interview that you never met her? Weren't you worried at the time though that what ever you were accused of, that the lie you told could easily be disproved by the fact you had exchanged phone numbers?    
What did you do for a year?  
I worked out. A lot. By the time I came out of there, I was the most fit I've ever been in my whole life. Of course, being in juvie for a year and then getting out suddenly meant I could eat all the junk food ever. My stomach never recovered.  
[removed]  
[removed]  
Nip that shit in the bud.  When I was in juvie, I worked out a lot. But the food was portioned, so getting seconds was a rare treat. I got really built quick. The high protein, no junk food they served did it. As soon as I got out, I went to town on junk food. It's taken me years to calm down and I topped out at 275Lbs. Down to 245Lbs now. You may think you're still young and you have time, I'm turning 37. Time flew by. I do know where you're coming from. It's going to be hard to stop. Your body has the mindset to eat all the good stuff because it thinks it'll never get that chance again, thanks to prison. I still don't know how to not eat everything in front of me. Like it going to waste or in the garbage is a bad thing. Anyway. Just a friendly heads up.   
What is your life like now? Have you found it difficult finding work? Do many people in your day to day life know you did time? Do they know it was for something you didn't do? How did being sent to prison as a teenager effect your education?   
My life right now is actually pretty normal: I'm engaged, I work, nothing really crazy. I do write for a gaming site (gamecloud.net.au) and fly over east every now and again for conventions, but that's about as exciting as it gets. I've never had any problems with finding work since this all happened before I was 18, meaning I've got a sealed record. I don't tend to talk about it much these days, so most people don't actually know I was in prison and even some who do still don't know what for. It's only kool to say "I was in prison once," when you don't have to follow it up with a five minute explanation that, no, you're not a pervert. My education died the day I was arrested - there are distance education things that one can do while inside, but it was incredibly difficult for me to focus on it. So I didn't. I even tried to go back to school afterwards, but to be honest I never really liked school anyway - I just went into work full time and have been doing that ever since.  
It's very hard for someone to remain remanded for almost one year as a juvenile, even if the alleged charges are horrific. Did you have any previous dealings with police that assisted in their remand application?  
Nope. I'd never spoken to the Police or been involved in any kind of investigation. The extended remand period is actually pretty easy to explain: We went for bail five times and we were knocked back the first four because of "new evidence" that the police would present at each hearing. The fifth and successful bail hearing came about because the girl was brought into the prosecutors office two days before the trial and changed her story. It really was just a case of the cops pulling dodgy shit to keep someone they didn't like where they wanted them to be.  
I don't see it as that dodgy. Until she changed her story and the DNA evidence came it, it didn't look that good for you. There were phone records between you, and CCTV footage showing someone matching your description following the girl from the train station she claimed to have been raped near. Why on earth did you lie about having called her? Had you not done that it's pretty likely that you wouldn't have been remanded.  
I've answered why I didn't say as much in another question, but the short answer is: I was scared. Some don't find that an acceptable answer, but that's kool - you don't have to, it just is the explanation. As for the way the cops performed their investigation, here is a short list of things they did while investigating:  The police called to tell me two officers were coming around to "ask me some questions," but not tell me what. Seven hours later, my house was swarmed by detectives and cops who woke me up at 2am and questioned me. Had me ride in the same car as my accuser, while we both wore the same set of clothing we'd been wearing that night. Had a known associate of my mother collect my DNA evidence. Tried to introduce evidence that a medical expert was able to dismiss as "not real" Introduced "new evidence" at every bail hearing I had, bar one, in attempt to keep me from getting bail - which worked, by the way, even though the "evidence" each time turned out to be absolutely nothing, which was why we were able to keep going for bail hearings at all.  This is just a short, SHORT list, and from the police mostly - dodgy really doesn't quite cover the way the investigation and case was handled.  
Did you being innocent but still in prison make you think that maybe you weren't the only one? Did you give people the benefit of the doubt? Did other inmates who were sentenced for rape tell you they were innocent?  
There was only one other kid in there for sexual offences - he was eight and he was one of the scariest motherfuckers I have ever had the displeasure of meeting.  It was really difficult for me to empathise with anyone at that point, I was in such an alien environment. The stereotype of people being in prison having come from shit home backgrounds is, for the most part, actually kind of true. Conversely, I was a white kid from the 'burbs who was into videogames, D&D, and not having my head kicked in - I was in it for me, for the most part, and a lot of other people didn't get a second thought.  After the event, I certainly give people the benefit of the doubt when in similar situations, but it's not my first thought. It kind of sucks, but when you get back into the real world, you have a tendency to slip into the same sort of thinking as people around you.  
[deleted]  
Why do you feel this girl brought those charges against you? Why you and not someone else?  
What was your reaction when you saw the TIL?  
Was your family ever able to get compensation for the cost of defending you in court?   
Hey man, I'm really sorry to hear you went through this.  I live in the US now, but I was born and raised in Perth.  Shocks me to hear this went on, you have my condolences, very sorry the justice system failed you so horribly.  I'm just wondering what the pressure from the Australian press to get your story is like?  Are reporters knocking on your door frequently?  Are you planning to go more public with your story or are you asking to be left alone by the press?  Best wishes mate.  
If you had contact with your accuser would you have anything to say to her? If so, what?  
Not really - I've had all kinds of imaginary arguments and conversations in my head, all centered around exactly how that situation would go down. In the end I just decided I didn't care enough to seek it out, I don't think I'd get anything out of it and ultimately it'd probably just keep stressing me out about something I'd left behind me years ago now.  
If she contacted you instead, what would be the ideal thing to hear her say?  
I don't even have any questions, just came here to say you're cool as fuck man!  
What are the things you don't want to talk about?  
Have you had any encounters with the girl who falsely accused you after doing time? If so, how did it feel to see her, and how did she herself react?   
Dude, I read through all your comments. You've got character. Power to you.  
what were your last words towards yours inmates when leaving ?  
I'm waiting for trial and am facing 10 years in prison over the police doing a shit job and pretty much making crap up and letting the paper publish it.  Now it's hit national ABC nightly news and recently international news with England and German also reporting on it. (Maybe other countries too that I don't know) EVERYONE on my Facebook, academic colleagues, and small town know.  I'm guilty before anyone even hears my side of it.  Lost my job over it, parents are using all their retirement, and getting death threats.  Life sucks.  As someone who dealt with all of these same problems and emotions, what advice do you have for me?  In retrospect, is there anything you wish you would or wouldn't have done?   
[deleted]  
[removed]  
I actually take a lot of issue with /r/theredpill, mostly because of the ridiculous world view they take. The argument "Women are using their sexual and feminine wiles to ruin the world for all men!" is just as stupid as "All men get together to work out how to oppress all women everywhere!" Any discussion about gender equality which starts from a basis of "I think everyone should follow my philosophy because the other gender is evil," isn't a discussion.  
I'm a little in love with you.  
For someone who's been through what you've been through at such a young age to have such a grown up and responsible view of things, it really does give me hope for your generation. Thank you.  
What about /r/mensrights?  
 "Women are using their sexual and feminine wiles to ruin the world for all men!"  You know that's not actually the red pill 'philosophy'? If you're paying attention to the comments by all the angry kids in there, you're making a mistake.   
I applaud you for your level headed outlook on your experience. But damn, man...I don't know how it's possible. I feel like I would want to destroy that girl's life and everything around it. How do you keep yourself from the urge to get revenge?  
I've read a few of your responses and I don't really understand how you can be so serene about what happened to you. Your reputation was ruined, you were locked up for a year and you were subjected to significant physical and mental abuse from other inmates all over entirely false charges. If it had happened to me I think I'd either be a complete, miserable wreck or out for revenge against everyone involved in it. How do you cope so well with what happened to you? I'd really like to know, since I sometimes have problems coping with bad stuff that happened to me in my life, although I've never experienced anything approaching what you've been through.  
Do you have any advice for other innocent people who have been accused of a crime? How did you keep calm with such anger and anxiety? I'm glad your life is coming back on track, man. And I'm sorry such a horrible thing happened to you, keep on trekin'!  
How would you react if you were around a radical feminist spouting about "rape culture" and how men perpetrate it? Do you tend to stay out of discussions involving that?   
Can you walk me through your average day in prison?  
Whats the first thing you did when you got out?  
SO this was the one that happened in perth right, and you were taken into custody when your parents were out of town right? if I'm  recalling this correctly I think I saw the documentary. What kind of preparation did you have for your trial? What was the financial situation for your family after such a long trial?  
Did you get your Christmas gift this year ? If not then give us your address.I think you deserve one. EDIT:PM your address :P  
First, I am so sorry our justice system failed you. Secondly, thank you for doing the AMA. Third, my questions: (1) How does it make you feel that her name was suppressed (As she was the perpetrator) and your name was everywhere (when you were the victim) (2) What was it like seeing your story on Reddit tonight?   
[removed]  
Man, I write about videogames in my spare time - my name was going to end up on the internet in some way or another at some point. At least when you search my name, articles like the one in my OP come up and not things like "THIS GUY IS LYING AND EVIL AND BLWAGRKLGBEIJKHVI." I'm happy to leave well enough alone.  
No question as such. I honestly don't think I could have remained as positive as you, I know you said you were cynical, a bit mistrusting of the police and of women. But other than that you sound incredibly mature in how you've handled this. I think if it were myself in that position it would've destroyed me, or I would spend years plotting revenge. Live the best life you can dude!  
What gave you hope?  
A good title would be "The Rape Crisis in America". You could highlight the issue of false accusation, given there is plenty of it, with no repercussions on the accuser.  
sigh ... hugs merry Christmas man.   
What are your thoughts about false accusations on men raping women?  
[deleted]  
Do you believe the District Attorney acted in a a criminal manor in handling your case?  
I hope your life is much better now. Keep kicking ass. Maybe an odd question; but do you feel that the whole thing was worth it because it made who you are now? (I've been through a tonne of shit, but I'm sort of glad because it made me who I am now.)  
so, why haven't you sued the bitch and her family for everything they have after she fucked over your life?  
If you compare the movies to the actuality, what'sthe difference?  
Your attitude makes me want to spend a year in jail. You have really nice way of looking at things, and seem to be a pretty fucking cool person. Maybe you were before too, but hell I want to get shredded as fuck.  Only question I can think of is what did it feel like to hear she took it back? And what did it feel like when you heard you were getting out and all?  
Wow, what a story. You've done extremely well to stay so level headed. Props to you man. Just to ask, was there anything you did on that night that could've influenced her to bring up these allegations against you? And in what situation was it - were you two at a party, dating etc? And what was her age when you were 15? Thank you for answering!  
Did they news that you didn't do it reach the other inmates at any point and what was their reaction if so?  
Have you had any relationships with women since then? I read in another comment you having a fear of being alone with women, has this stopped you from pursuing romance? Or have any other women found out about the alleged charges and backed off? Edit: Never mind I read more comments and saw that you have a fianc√©e, so I'll adjust the question: how long did it take you to get the point where you could start trusting women enough to begin dating again?  
I notice a lot of your "forgiveness/understanding" of her actions comes from a few places, either that your records are sealed, that you were released, or that she was young too, but I can't help but feel this forgiveness comes from a place of relief. Your adult life isn't ruined, you can hold a good job, and you're not in prison.  The question is, could you understand her actions if you were still hypothetically in jail, getting the shit kicked out of you, no hope for the future?  
What do you think of feminists who fight against prosecution of false accusers?  
hey OP, i was the guy that accidentally doubted you in the other thread (sorry about that!) firstly, just want to say sorry you had to go through this. i cant imagine the effect that had on you and your family. and you are much more understanding and level headed than most others would be. what exactly was the girls story origiannly? because this version sounds so outrageous i cant believe anyone would believe it: "the girl's new story included being raped by two different men in two hours. She said the cinema sex with a 20-year-old, who she had met on the internet, was rape, but she didn't want him charged because it might affect her compensation claim." did you previously have any sort of relationship with her? do you have any idea of her motivation behind this whole situation? i cant imagine going through what you did, and the amount of cool you are handling it with is commendable!   
Okay so, first,  I just want to say how incredibly impressive it is that you seem to have come out so far from this with a mature and level head. I'm genuinely glad for you that your life wasn't completely destroyed.  My question is actually about your family.  After watching the documentary,  I have such an urge to hug your mom, especially.   So... how is she?  How are your dad and siblings doing these days?    
How has this experience changed being in a relationship?  
When did the whole thing become "real" for you? I mean, at first I would have been like "the cops will figure out that she's making stuff up", then in court I would have figured that the judge and/or jury will see through the lies and so on.  
did you lose any friends over the allegations/conviction? Any big changes in attitude you from pre allegation --> conviction ---> found innocent  
Well at least you weren't accused of child rape. I watched "The Hunt (2012)" and it's scary how the effects of being falsely accused can haunt you even after being proven innocent. Were there any people out to get you in a violent way?  
[deleted]  
Was their anyone who always had your back and believed your story all the way to the point where you were incarcerated? Are you still close with him/her?   
[deleted]  
Do you have any interactions with any of the same police officers and do you feel in any way they "have it in" for you, meaning do you feel threatened that they watch you extra closely etc?  
So what does your permanent record look like? Anything on that at all? What ever happened to the chick?  
Before I read anything, I went straight to see the verification picture; Jesus christ I was like "Holy shit! That's a fello 15 year old!?" ... Then I saw the edit.  
Have you ever thought about killing or at least taking a few fingers from this disgraceful human being?  
dude post this at /r/IAMA instead  
Holy crap dude! I remember you from school. I was maybe 2/3 years above you but I remember you quite well. I mostly remember you for carrying around a briefcase or something similar instead of a backpack like most kids. Anyway, sucks about what happened, but glad it hasn't affected your life negatively too much.  
Did you ever talk to the girl after prison?  
If you ever had a son, what would you tell him so the same doesn't happen to him, or would you hide it from him?  
Sorry if these have already been asked somewhere else: After being cleared and released from prison did you ever go back to the prison to gloat at the bastards that beat you up? Did you ever meet up with any of the inmates that helped you? Gratz on getting cleared of all this, I only hope your future is epic from here on out!  
I'm Australian, so I was pretty ashamed to hear this situation was able to happen in the Australian courts. But anyway! What's your favourite sport? Have you been enjoying the cricket? :-)  
I'm 29. For the first 14 years of my life I was abused by my older sister. Beaten. Hit. Tortured. Stabbed. Cut. Tied up. Choked. I reported it to my parents and teachers about her and even wrote a letter and walked to the police station begging them for help because I was 10 and didn't know who to ask for help.  No one believed me.  Then once I hit puberty I suddenly became bigger and stronger.  That's when the incest. Rape. Abuse,  accusations started. Not once in 14 years did the police or people I trusted try to protect me when I couldn't protect myself when I wasnt even 15. Then at the word of a 17 year old girl with nothing better to do than ruin lives after the first time I manage to physically stop the abuse the cops were at my door with handcuffs. I was put in shared housing labeled a danger was told not to try to contact people I knew or family and had to do sessions with people who, like the 8 year old kid who was a bad as mofo  you were in there with. Scared the shit out of me. I grew up way to fast. All because of 1 stupid girl who was then subsequently locked up in a mental ward and since has been abusing others and I hear jumps from person to person abusing them then leaving if they realize what she is. At least that's what I hear from old old friends of friends of friends. When I say, I feel for you and understand. I really really do. The only thing is... the anger. The bitterness. It's been 15 years. I don't even remember her face. However the memories of what she did just for the hell of it... I've never been able to let go. I still wake up at night with anxiety attacks. Heck it's 3am now. I find it extremely hard to focus at work. I graduated university a couple of years ago as an engineer. Everyone in my class was what I felt, children by comparison. I couldn't relate or fit in. Now I'm fairly well off I guess I feel like I'm about to reach where I should have been 15 years ago once again with friends and family. I hope my story also helps those understand the cruelty and injustice that exists in this world. I'm often perceived as emotionless and very 'hard' but inside I'm pretty much a glass train wreck.  All those people who say 'oh she should be locked up and beaten...' probably. But that's not how people like that work. In her mind she probably truly believes what she says is true. Or in some way a version of it. From now until the end of time. Even if she was locked up and told what she did was wrong. Simply because that's how those kinds of people work and very very rarely do others see this dark underbelly that is the human condition.  I applaud you for having the courage to take the time to answer people's questions and maybe show a few people that the world isn't fair. It is what it is and they think before speaking. Or at the very least don't believe what's shoved in front of their face.  Thanks for sharing your story. I hope you have everything go your way and nothing but the best opportunities fall in your lap. I hope every last dream and ambition comes to fruition for you and your family.   
I do hope your family found closure as you certainly seem to have, for the life of me I'm not sure how but you are obviously a better person than me. I have so much fear for my son having read this and at this moment so thankful that he'd rather sit on steam at the weekend than go out! I wish you and your family a happy and fulfilled future, you sure as hell deserve it x  
How much did your initial lie hurt you and spurn the prosecution, and how long did you maintain that lie?  
I really hope you see this. Curious, what is your impression of the QC that handled your case when you were in Banksia? Looks like a really sharp dude and very focused on your case. Did he (or via fam) keep you in loop?  
You mentioned you became pretty jacked inside. How much did that help when it comes to defending yourself back then? Did you have any significant injuries from prison? Glad to hear you're doing much better now. Cheers.   
Wasn't there a documentary made about you? I think i remember watching it  
Why were you in jail so long if you weren't convicted?  Was bond not an option?  
What did you do in the months after your release? I'm pretty sure I would tell everyone to fuck off and go lay on a beach somewhere for a few weeks.  
Cats or dogs?  
Do you feel as if your story would make some real victims rape afraid of going to the police?  
What would you say / do if you overheard an acquaintance considering accusing someone of rape?  For example if a workmate was talking to another colleague about her boyfriend cheating on her and was planning rape charges for revenge?  
Have you received an apology from the girl or her family....or any form of emotional compensation.   
[removed]  
How will future jobs be affected by the false accusations? Are you still a registered sex offender?  
What do you do now? Did this case mess up any college plans, or anything..?   
Did you ever get compensated for being in prison for a year for something you didn't do?  
Beans?

Anyone dying young is a tragedy, so I‚Äôm incredibly sorry for you and your family. Your willingness to do this AMA is admirable.  I have a small suggestion, which might be the ultimate gift to your family long after you‚Äôre gone. This was an idea I saw in an old movie.  There is an old 1993 movie (I‚Äôm in my mid 40‚Äôs) starring Michael Keaton called ‚ÄúMy Life‚Äù where he‚Äôs diagnosed with cancer and given 4 months to live. It‚Äôs an ugly-cry type movie. But he has young kids and gets a camcorder (remember it‚Äôs 1993) and starts recording parenting videos for his young kids‚Äîkind of a here are some tips on becoming a man later in life. I have 2 young sons and have always said I‚Äôd do the same thing should I suffer the same fate.  Take videos of yourself and take voice recordings of yourself talking to your parents/siblings/nieces/nephews. It doesn‚Äôt always have to be profound or sad, it could be reminiscing about old stories or reliving funny stories like the time your dad was trying to put the star on top of the Christmas tree, slipped and took the whole damn tree down. Maybe you record some future milestone videos like for when your sibling has a baby or for when your Dad retires.  I suggest this because I have a friend in their 40‚Äôs whose Dad died last year and they recently told me ‚ÄúI‚Äôd give anything to hear his voice again.‚Äù He has memories but longed just to hear his voice one more time. Our kids are supposed to bury us, not the other way around. Your parents will crave to hear your voice long after you are gone.  Damn, I‚Äôm tearing up just typing this. My best to you, young man, may your life be lived to the fullest, however long that may be.   
My mom died when I was 16, very quickly, of brain cancer. She didn't have time to do something like that, however there was an audio tape she had made at some sort of parent program at my school that they later gave me. The exercise was for the parents to say to the kids what they were proud of and what made thwm happy knowing about the kids. It is my single most important possession, and the thing I will take in a fire. This advice. Take it.  
Please, please, please, make yourself backup copies. Digital, hard copies, upload it, please make yourself copies. When I was in audio engineering school one of the most important things they taught us was that it doesn't exist until it exists at least twice.  
This is really a top comment. I'll definitely consider this, and I think it's so nice to give my loved ones the option to remember me positively. Thank you   
This also somehow reminds me of what Erin Kramp did when she was diagnosed of terminal cancer. She was a guest on Oprah who recorded a lot of videos just for her young daughter before she died in 1998. Leaving a legacy for your relatives is definitely one of the best things you can do. :)   
This comment for real is the most amazing advice ever. I just lost my dad to cancer last year and I was 24 at the time. I still have some text messages of him being goofy but I lost the only sound of his voice I had that wasn‚Äôt his company phone voicemail. He had called me and left me a voicemail months before he died and left me a stupid joke as a voicemail, and as much as I thought it was dumb it was still his voice. It allowed me to laugh and hear his voice one more time in a relaxed setting, and then I got a new phone, and before I asked about it my phone got wiped and I lost his voice. That is the hardest thing. I would do anything to be able to hear his voice again, and to be able to raise my kids (when I have them) where they could at least hear his voice. Make the videos for your family, even if it‚Äôs hard for you or sad it‚Äôs okay because it will mean everything to them just to be able to hear your voice. I promise. I‚Äôm so sorry you have to deal with cancer because it‚Äôs terrible, enjoy your life though. My dad spent every day trying to laugh and make others laugh. Don‚Äôt lose who you are to the disgusting disease and just enjoy every day and the people around.  
Your story along with OP‚Äôs just broke my fucking heart. I am so so sorry that you lost that. My dad died when I was younger and even though there are pictures and stories, it‚Äôs not the same.   
My uncle and my dad were best friends growing up. Once my dad got married he introduced my moms sister to him and the rest was history. A couple years ago he passed away and for the first couple months after i could find my father listening to the few voicemails that still had the sound of his voice on it in the evenings.  You‚Äôre on a incredibly difficult journey yourself, but I bet if you did something along those lines it would mean more to your loved ones than you or I could ever know.  I‚Äôm sorry for what you‚Äôre going through and thank you for sharing you experiences with us. It really is an honor to have gotten to hear your story.   
I made a build-a-bear with my Grandma's voice telling me she loves me. She's been gone 7 years. I still miss her dearly and think of her all the time . When they days of missing her overwhelm me, I squeeze my bear to hear her voice. I try not to squeeze it too much anymore as I don't want it to stop working, but that's a very great recommendation you gave   
That was hard to read... i wish my dad would have done this although he left a handwritten note which i still havent been able to read and its been a year and a half now... working up the courage but i really appreciate him leaving something like that to go back and read later on. Its handwritten too which makes it way more special  
i don‚Äôt know why but reading this comment made me cry wtf   
bro this  made tear up. I am a mess and it's barely noon. this is beautiful! I hope OP considers this!  
Thanks man, it‚Äôs such an awful situation all around. I cannot fathom what his parents are going through. Let‚Äôs go watch some YouTube videos of people falling down or getting hit in the nuts to cheer us up.   
haha man I am gonna go see my college counselor and then go work out! this made me sad. ps. I just watched the trailer for my life. I am gonna watch it this weekend for sure. I was born in 1993 haha.   
The voice recordings are key. I keep certain  voicemails from all of my loved ones. I have one from years ago from my dad telling me how proud he is of me and how much he loves me. He‚Äôs not an overly emotional person, so it‚Äôs really special.   
my heart hurts seeing you like this man. but I got so many questions to ask you so please bear with me. 1.) how does your family feel about your current situation?  2.) do you think you lived your life to the fullest (I know dumb question since you are only 21), but what I mean is did you have a good hs life? did you have a lot of friends? did you have a gf? etc etc 3.) do you believe in an after life? like do you think there is a different universe. like what is your concept of death? are you scared of dying? or are you scared of the feeling of not knowing what death is like? 4.) it hurts to ask me this, but how do you plan on spending the last months of your life?  5.) what are some of the things you are gonna miss the most? people that you are gonna miss the most? and what are you proud of the most? please respond back to me man, I really want to know!  
Hey man, you have some good questions and I'll gladly answer them!  1) Ofcourse it's devastating for them. They know beforehand they'll lose a son. But how weird and maybe even uncomfortable as it sounds, we are enjoying the moments I'm still here. 2) Which brings me here, and yes I had a pretty nice life. Girlfriend, did a lot of activities, sport. I am only 21, granted. But the thing I did, i always did it because i chose for my own happiness. That makes me feel very happy about the time that I had.  3) I'm scared because I really don't know what to expect. I'm not religious myself, but deep inside, I hope I could watch over my loved ones.  4) Doing nice thing with friends and family. That's so important. It's one of the things I learned in the past year and a half. (Time since diagnosis). I talked with many terminal people and "we" all say the same. When death comes, money doesn't matter. People do. 5) my friends and family. Those I'll miss the most ofcourse. I'm most proudest of the people I helped. My case is really bad for my age. And in the hospital, I was in the young adults area most of the time. So I spoke to many young adults who had a hard time getting through chemo. I myself am very experienced in this treatment, so I could ease the pain a bit for them and talk to them. I actually had the nursing team told me that a 17 yo girl mentioned specifically. I had helped her so much. I hope she does well btw.  So I think I covered everything. Ask more if you'd like!  
you have such a kind heart man, im low key getting emotional at 11:47 am. but yes I wanna ask you a couple more. Ps. my dad had cancer when i was 22 (I am 25 now) and he beat it but it really took a toll on his body but he is recovering well and  he is cancer free  and I am so thankful for that. I just hope you find peace within yourself man. you are a young king, don't let anyone tell you any different.  but in one of your comments you said you have a twin sister? wow man how is she dealing with this whole situation? can she also get the same type of cancer you have since you guys are twins?   
Again some good questions. First of all, I wish your dad the best health and that he may flourish and be healthy!  True, we were afraid that it may be a hereditary thing, but after 9 months of research done, they concluded it had nothing to do with DNA and that sort of thing. And like I said. It's hard for her. That's also the thing that hurts me the most   
I hope heaven is real and I hope you have a MUCH MUCH MUCH better after life with no suffering! Thanks for being on this earth man and thanks for being so open about this! much love ‚ù§‚ù§  
What‚Äôs the one thing that makes you completely laugh your ass off, like tears in your eyes, snort laugh, stomach ache laugh? And contrarily; what‚Äôs the one thing that makes you cry in sadness? Thanks for the AMA.  Sending you comfort.  
Haha like this one. Seeing busy people in public places hurrying and stressing because they are late on schedule, or say, people really giving themselves a hard time over something that I find in the light of my situation, very irrelevant. Makes me laugh thinking, there really is more to life than always being busy. My tip, once in a while, really choose for yourself.  What makes me really sad is the fate of my parents and sister. I'm twins and we really had the plans to grow up. Both have families and be close with each other. That's a future she has to face alone now. That hurts so much. Thanks for your comment. This is why I do this AMA.  
Damn bro im 19 and got a twin brother, if anything happened to him I feel like my entire life  would pretty much fall apart since the dude is basically my best friend. Defiently do what that top comment said about recording yourself. And make sure you throw in some motivational ones too cause if I was your sister I'd definetly need them to get through college or work or life in general. Screw this post man, got me chocking up and stuff. Best wishes to you and your family from me!   
Thank you for your support man, much appreciated! It‚Äôs devastating to know that my brother and best friend isn‚Äôt gonna be there when I turn 80. We like joking around with Snapchat so we/I‚Äôve got some great videos on my phone already. Gonna make some more memories in the time that we have left!  
I‚Äôm a twin and have been cancer free for 3 years. This comment just punched me in the gut and i realize how scared my twin must have been. So much love to you and your sister. ‚ù§Ô∏è  
I‚Äôm so glad that you‚Äôre cancer free! Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è   
How has your view of death changed since your diagnosis? What is the most important thing you feel you will miss out on? I haven't had to face a terminal illness but the thought of that happening does scare me. People don't often believe me when I say it but I honestly don't fear death itself but I do fear how I could die. By reading your answers and responses in this thread it seems you are a very deep thinking individual. I admire that more than anything in a person. Maybe the reason you are leaving early is because you truly are wise beyond your years.  I liked how in one response to a question you stated you feel very sorry for your family having to go on without you. How much it hurts you to know that. I think of death more often than the average person and that bothers me more than most things about it. The fact that if I died my fiance and parents would have to go on. I feel that most people don't think that way. Most are just scared for themselves. I wish I could give you a hug and I wish I could split the years I have left with you. I'm only 30 and I would do it without second thought. I'm sorry if someone already asked this but what are your thoughts for what happens next?  I saw you aren't religious, neither am I. But I do believe all consciousness survives. I never could understand how or why people feel that is any crazier than us being here in the first place. String theory proposes that there is 11 spatial dimensions. Just last year in 2018 scientists were able to carry out an experiment with light and crystals that showed obstructions in the light. These obstructions were coming from the fourth spatial dimension. It was the first time that we have ever been able to actually directly observe anything like this. To think there is so much going on around us at all times and to think we know it all is comical. I feel the materialistic view of reality will be shattered within 50 years. Nothing is even solid. Just billions of atoms swirling around one another creating the illusion of solidity.  Sorry for the rant but I would love to know what you think and I wanted to give you a little to think about yourself. If you ever want to chat with someone I will always be here man. Feel free to PM me whenever.   
You really make me think about all this indeed. It's not crazier for an afterlife to be here than it is for us being here. I'm open and I'll see what's next. I truly appreciate your comment. Totally agree with you. What's the meaning of life right  
Hello fellow redditors! I‚Äôm OP‚Äôs twin sister. It‚Äôs devastating to know that my brother and best friend isn‚Äôt gonna be there when I turn 80.  Knowing that he‚Äôs not able to attend life events like getting my nursing degree or getting married etc. is heartbreaking.  But he is still here and we‚Äôre going to make some more memories in the time that we have left!  I‚Äôm going to be around here to help my brother answer your questions! Thanks for the support, it means a lot ‚ù§Ô∏è  
Hello!  I'm a cancer nurse myself, although not sarcoma. I've scrolled but I didn't see your brother mention when he was diagnosed.  My question is, did your brother's diagnosis inspire you towards nursing?  Also, OP, it's really brave and inspiring that you are willing to share your insight for people. I often find that communication between my patients and their relatives can be strained because they find they don't know what to say. You and other people doing things like this helps break down these barriers ‚ù§Ô∏è   
Hi! My bother was diagnosed on Black Friday in 2017.  Yes, it inspired me to be a nurse. I saw on the hospital ward where he had his chemo therapy how incredibly busy they were (Short staffed).  At the time I wasn‚Äôt sure what I wanted to be. This experience certainly helped me to decide that I want to be a nurse. Thank you for your support üíï  
If you are twins then he will always be with you x  
I do think that too, thank you! X  
Glad you're here ;)  
How long did it take to accept your unfortunate fate? What was the hardest part about accepting it?  
When I got diagnosed, the first thing you focus on is actually getting better. But while i had a stable situation. I began to see the situation how it really is. It was bad. The hardest part is always thinking you'll live life until you're old. Have kids etc. I have to accept that I just won't. But it made me aware of how limited time I (everybody in general ofcourse) have. So I enjoy my time right now  
Genuinely curious, what made you want to do this?  
I'm really intrigued about how other people feel towards someone in this situation. I'm a person who is very open towards my death. It helps me in the process as well. Like a therapy maybe ;)  
Are you religious?   
I'm not religious. However some of my close friends are and I'm very open to receive their prayers.  
Well then I will pray for you and your family. And anyone who might be close to you.  
I'm so proud of you for being open. How'd you get to that point? Of acceptance? I can't even imagine. Big love and I'm also a twin, that's a special kind of love. Big love to your twinny. If she needs someone, I'm here x  
What‚Äôs the feeling like to know your fate?  
Quite damning as you can imagine. But it's actually a battle that I'm fighting. That costs energy. When the doctors told me they only would treat to soften pain. It gave a feeling of relief, weirdly enough.   
How long did the drs give you to live?   
Nowadays they won't actually tell you, because most of the time it's completely off. But I'm guessing it's months   
Do you wish they would give you a timeline, or are you happy with the uncertainty? Also, what were your first symptoms?   
What do you do to entertain yourself? Do you have any top three books, songs/bands, or movies you‚Äôve discovered since the diagnosis?  
Music in general, I love it! I love shooters and rocket league in games. I'll be visiting Hollywood Undead in April, kinda as a last wish. I love the Steven King books!  
Hell yeah what rank are you in RL? Nice shot! What a save! Savage!  
What a save! What a save!  What a save! Chat disabled for 5 seconds. I'm champ 2 now in standard. I was S8 GC #bucketlist  
Damn dude you‚Äôre well beyond me. I‚Äôm, what they call, a GC stuck in plat ;) Hope you are well, man, all things considered. You seem like a super nice person. Fuck cancer.   
What's your favorite Stephen King book?   
I love under the dome so far, am reading it. Love all the tension and gore sometimes   
Have you ever used psychedelics?   What are some things that you really want to do before you pass?  
Haha I have used weed and am using medical weed right now. And I don't really have something that I want to do in particular. Just enjoying my time   
[deleted]  
Well, for what it‚Äôs worth, I admire your optimism and wish you the best.    
Do you have any preference on burial vs cremation? I‚Äôm in mortuary school and it‚Äôs really rare to see someone who‚Äôs so death-accepting and willing to discuss.  Also, are you a dog or a cat person?  
I would prefer cremation. Mostly because it's common in my family. Both my grandparents died in the past year. They wanted to have their ashes released on Terschelling (NL) (I'm Dutch btw). Now I thing I want that too. I'm very much a cat person :)  
You could go to a tattoo parlor and see if they would let you give her a tiny tattoo. It would be pretty cool if you could give her one, even if it doesn't look good it would be extremely special. Edit: By her I mean your sister =)   
Omg that's soooooo cool!! Thanks so much!!!!!  
My son died from anaplastic rhabdomyosarcoma 7 years ago.  The ink of my only tattoo contains some of his ashes. I am sorry you and your family are going through this, it is an unspeakably cruel illness.    
Angiosarcoma survivor here.  Just want to say FUCK CANCER!!!!   
Kind of odd you feel the need to tell someone terminally I'll that you beat cancer....  
You rock! FUCK CANCER  
Please may I have the name of a chosen charity to donate to, pick any and I will donate ¬£15. It‚Äôs not much but for me it‚Äôs the most I can do (still at school). God zegene je.   
Oh my, that's so generous. I'd suggest KWF (Dutch cancer organization) or a local equivalent. So I'd suggest this  
Thanks so much. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard it too much  but I‚Äôm so sorry for your illness. One day I hope to visit the Netherlands, go to Amsterdam. It looks like an amazing place and I hope you enjoy it.   
Do people treat you differently since you've "accepted" your death? If so, how does it make you feel?  
You can tell who are  the "real" and "fake" friends. And talking about it is hard and uncomfortable. But when you do, it all becomes easier.  
It's a hard thing, facing death when you're  young with limited life experience.   One of my friends from high school developed a terminal glioblastoma.  As he progressed, he lost the ability to speak and it was really hard for me at the time to see him like that.  I withdrew from him and wasn't really around him when he passed.   At the time, I didn't have the awareness to even see what I was doing let alone why I was doing it.   Now, as an older adult looking back, my actions and motivations were clear.   it is one of the things I regret the most about my youth.     
I see that every story has to sides. The friends who don't talk to me anymore may find it hard to. Like you said, it's not easy to be around. I hope you know that your friend did know you were there for him. (Ofcourse I don't want to put words in his mouth, bless him). Knowing someone supports you, even if it's only thoughts and prayers helps. I don't blame my friends for keeping distance.  
how can you tell which are "real" and "fake" friends?  
What are your favorite video games, books, movies? Least favorite?  Maybe some fellow redditors can recommend some new stuff to entertain you :)  
I really love Rocket League and Battlefield! I love Steven King's books. I have some trouble concentrating for longer periods of time, but I'm really a true gamer   
Do you have any regrets? What advice would you give to those your age? Also really sorry to hear you‚Äôre going through this as well as your family. I wish that by some miracle you could kick cancers ass. Nobody deserves this.   
Don't have any big ones. I must admit that when I was 14, i made the life of an coming out transgender harder than it had to be for that person. I do think I'll contact her and say what I want before it's too late.  
You even thinking about that while facing the hardest thing a person can go through really shows you‚Äôve got a heart of gold, OP.  May your moments be filled with love and happiness ‚ù£Ô∏è  
Is there ANYTHING I can do for you bro? ‚úåüèΩ  
This support is penty! Lots of love!  
Hi!  Thanks for doing the AMA... I'm so very sorry to hear about your situation. I lost my dad half a year ago, so I've been thinking a lot about death and what I would have done differently if I knew in advance that he would die. I very much agree with OlFlirtyBastard's idea of making recordings for your close ones.  Reading your responses here, you seem like such a peaceful, delightful person.  Do you think your ways of interacting with people have changed ever since you found out about your illness? There are some people who say "once you get old, there's no point in holding back... so I just say what I mean!" We have all these social dynamics that dictate how we are supposed to relate to others, codes of politeness and distance when it comes to meeting new people, all that. What about dealing with conflict situations? Has it become easier or harder to solve problems with people you love? Sorry if this is an insensitive question! No need to answer, in this case. :)  I am writing my PhD thesis about artists' perception of time, so I am of course wondering if your perception of time changed at all, or the way you relate to your everyday experiences... The way we slip through everyday life is mostly (supposed to be?) kind of transparent, taken for granted. Some philosophers say that art can change your sense of time this way, make you stop and appreciate. I would think it might be something like that with a terminal illness, too. What do you think?  Sending you heaps of support and lots of love. I hope your life will be wonderful, I hope you will do everything you want to do. Big hugs!  ‚Äã ‚Äã  
Quality comment, I'll be glad to help you.  My way of interacting with people had changed. I'm very understanding in regarding to pain and illness ofcourse. Regarding to conflict, people seem to avoid any, or I'm really an easy person, but mostly if someone does something that I don't like, I'll just straight tell them or stand above the negativity. As for you PhD thesis: maybe the time went quite fast in the first part of my treatment. That part was really to get better, and so I focused on that goal, getting well. When reality slips in and you begin to wonder, will I make it? Will I survive at all? And for how long? That's when I started to appreciate everyday life like art can make you. You always live to die another day, but when that day comes, you'll live with every minute.  Has my perception changed on day to day basis, in the moment not, but I created a lot more memorable moments, so actually I'd say I remember more and appreciate more.  
Goddamnit, I'm trying not to cry in the middle of physics class. Is there something you've learned since your diagnosis that you think would help people in their own lives?  
Enjoy, enjoy enjoy! enjoy every SECOND that you're healthy and dont worry about small things  
What do you do in your free time?  
Mostly doing fun things with family and friends. Play some games and watch Netflix.   
I've written far too many coments on this post. Your a hero. Big love again and again X p.s I know you're not a dog person but my dog says hi (plus a fart)   
Hahaha thanks a lot. We had a dog for most of my life though, He was called Jock and was a Scottish Terrier. The following is actually true, we had to put him down due to old age on the DAY I got diagnosed. Thanks again <3  
Important question. What's your favorite color? (Its important to me okay)  
I'm sure all options were already discussed by your experts including new experimental methods to kill cancer cells and metastasis as published by Harvard medical and others, so instead of discussing things I have no clue of I just wish you the best rest of your life one can have. One last thought: Better short, but good than long, but shit.   
Thats exacly what i heard from a terminal patient who was 31. She said, we're here for a good time, not a long one (although it is preferred). ‚Äã  
About a year ago my 22 year old fiance' began having double vision intermittently. We went for an eye exam and they thought nothing of it, put her in new glasses and bingo fixed it. Within a couple of weeks the double vision returned and that is when we were sent for an MRI. Long story short after many consultations and finally a emergency surgery/biopsy (she lost her sight) we were given the news that it was a high grade Osteosarcoma which is odd because of its location, but not unheard of.  ‚Äã I always found myself trying to say something that would be comforting. Trying to find some words that..... I dunno put her mind at ease. I lost countless nights of sleep worrying about her thought process and what had to be going through her mind. It was like every day I was seeking to say something that just took all her doubts and pain away. I know this sounds redundant but if anyone reading this has been through it, they understand. Very hard to put into words. ‚Äã I guess what i'm wanting to ask is has anyone said anything to you that has brought you comfort? That is to say has there been something said to you that just made you smile and not think about things for a while? Something that every once in a while you think about if you are having a bad day and it brings joy to yourself?  
Dude, no question - but from one cat person/gamer/reader to another, I appreciate you taking the time to do this AMA and giving us all some perspective.  I‚Äôm on reddit procrastinating on some work and cleaning to do ahead of a rare visit from my parents, and I‚Äôm starting Under the Dome on audible right now and going to go do the shit I‚Äôm supposed to do so I can enjoy the next 6 days with my family.  
Can I ask you to go on with a smile? It makes me happy to see a person with such a huge problem to be like this so I would like to know that you will be able to be so as long as you can. Technically, it's a question, don't dodge it!  
[deleted]  
How are you doing man? Is there anything on your bucket list reddit could try help do together for you!?   
Those are the hardest questions, I'm quite selfless, cringe. No but doing something for cancer patients would be nice, a grand reddit money collection for cancer awareness and research.  
Something about this AMA strikes a chord somewhere deep inside me, it's difficult to explain. Perhaps it's because we're similarly young (I'm 19) and the idea of someone dying so young is horrifying. My question to you is, has your opinion on life changed since your diagnosis? I don't mean this in a "I have a bucket list and now I have a reason to finish them off as soon as I can" way. Did it ever make you sit down and just introspect on your life and your circumstances at that very moment?  Everyone looks back on their lives and wonders how it would pan out if they shuffled things up a little. Is there something you put off for later that you realise now should be done ASAP? Sorry for the mess of a question, I have a bunch more but that's it for now I guess.   
Definitely, I'm focusing on right now instead of the future. That's a life lesson I'd like to give. Exactly what you're saying. Saying things to loved ones, thing you consider not important can be important if you never get the chance to say them. That's a pro in knowing you'll die sooner than later.  
Thank you for taking the time to do this, I've learned so much from the comments and your answers. I've saved this post and plan to use the wisdom here to help me make the most of life.  
Hey man,  You are incredibly inspiring! I hope when my time comes I will be able to meet it with half of the grace and strength you have. My question: are you going to get more tattoos? Stay strong and if you meet a Marge on the other side, tell her her grandson misses her and loves her!  
I‚Äôm sorry to hear about your prognosis. I would hope that I could handle it as well as you seem to be, but I know that I wouldn‚Äôt. I know this because I‚Äôm being treated for stage 4 osteosarcoma (bone cancer). I had it in 2011, then in 2017, it had spread to my left lung, some lymph nodes in my chest, and my right adrenal gland.  Were it not for immunotherapy (it obliterated an inoperable tumor the size of a softball), I likely wouldn‚Äôt be here. What is it about your cancer that caused doctors to determine it‚Äôs untreatable? Mine was close to being the same, so it just a nerve close to home. In any case, I‚Äôm really glad you have access to weed and that the docs are keeping your pain in check.  
All too familiar. Doctors are always looking for immunotherapy, but it's not likely in my case. Time has to tell for me. Lots of strength to you, keep going. My cancer is extremely aggressive, and maybe some specifics that hinder the treatment. I don't know exactly. But I know they are trying their best.   
I‚Äôm petrified of not knowing what comes after death (highly not religious), like I get panic attacks from over thinking it. Have you been in a similar situation during all of this, if so how did you overcome it and what do you think happens. Btw thank you for doing this. You have certainly made a difference  
When I got to my late 30s, I developed a serious and distracting fear of death.  I spent my 20s and 30s drinking a lot, smoking like a chimney, doing assorted drugs, and generally being hard on myself most of the time (I also managed to build a strong career, get a master's degree, raise good kids, and maintain a marriage for 22 years (and counting)).   My fear of death really started impacting my ability to enjoy life.  I started having panic attacks.  I began to think every pain my body felt was cancer.  I was going to the doctor at least monthly, asking for blood work.  It was bad.  I went to the emergency room twice in two months because I thought I was having a heart attack. I got better when I started studying, then practicing, stoicism.  Reading Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, Epictetus...it really helped me contextualize my mortality and focus on living well with the time I have instead of constantly worrying that it will be over some day (and probably soon).   It isn't that I stopped thinking I was going to die, or that it would be soon, it's just that I stopped fearing it.  I just got my affairs in order, bought some life insurance so I didn't have to worry about my wife, got together a nice file of instructions for her to know how to collect the insurance and how to pay the mortgage, where to take her car if it needed work (on reflection, a good bit of my fear is that I was worried about my family if I wasn't around...so I fixed that).   With my affairs in order, I started making travel plans, spending more time with aging relatives, reading more books that I always said I wanted to, started practicing martial arts, inviting the kid's bf and gf to the house for Sunday dinner, hiking...just trying to make the most out of each day that I had.   I feel better now.  I hope you can, too.  DM me if you want, I know it can be scary and lonely to feel what you're feeling.

A friend of mine recently passed after a short but cruel battle with a rare form of cancer. She was 23. Thank you for giving me peace in my grief.   
I'll ask you something. Who's your favorite Pokemon?  
Damnit man.. I‚Äôm sorry. Hope you get better! What‚Äôs wrong with all you people, saying he‚Äôs going to pass away??? In this day and age people can beat cancer especially a 21 year old male..   
I'll add you to the reasons I am a Cancer Council volunteer. The local Relay for Life is just this weekend, and it's my 8th year as a photographer for the event. I'll be thinking of you for sure.  
Sending you all my positive energy and prayers, to your twin and family as well.   I‚Äôm a 14 year survivor of small cell renal cell cancer, with many post treatment complications.   I know it is very scary and a total rollercoaster.   üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª  
My beat friend died from a very rare terminal illness. When he was 24. He wasn‚Äôt meant to make it past 16. He was something like the 8th person in the world to ever be diagnosed with it.  To me. He was an angel sent down from heaven. I‚Äôve never ever met then, or since. Such a phenomenal guy. I miss him dreadfully. He was fully aware of his limited life and his forthcoming death!! And he just went with it. He never ever moaned (and man. He must of been in excruciating pain.) he lived his life to the fullest. I believe he was born. So people could learn from him. He was a truly truly beautiful BEAUTIFUL soul. He was a paraplegic and could only move 3 fingers. Yet we did soooo much stuff together. He also looked very strange. Like that Cher movie. The guy in that. But also in a wheelchair. People would stare and he‚Äôd invite them to chat. He taught people so much and I was truly honoured to be called his best friend.... What you‚Äôve said. You remind me of him ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è  
Genuinely curious. Let's say if, by some miracle, you beat cancer. How differently would you love your life?  My best to you. May you enjoy every moment of your life, however long that may be and hopefully that miracle happens. ‚ù§Ô∏è  
Yeah, it's life changing. I would enjoy every minute, just like I do. The thing I hope most is that everyone that reads this learns this from me and my case.  
Hi, I don't have anything to ask but I'm fighting cancer also. I just want to tell you that no matter what happens, you've already been a winner in this match, you have your family and that's the best thing on Earth. Thanks for giving me more strength to deal with this.  
does death scare you?  
What do you want me to remember? I promise I won't forget.  
I have a question: are you excited for game of thrones?  
Mad respect to you, bro, You're giving every one here a tremendous gift by doing this; you're reminding us of the fragility and temporary nature of life.  The thing is, you've been dealt a shit hand and you have a rough idea of when your time is up, and the rest of us sit here like we've got all the time in the world. But It's not guaranteed to any of us. ANY of us could go tonight from a heart attack, texting while driving, any number of things - you're doing more in your limited days to help people than most of us will in our 'infinite' ones (sarcasm).  So those of you reading, pay attention, We're all going to have to pay the piper eventually, so make the most of it: put the fucking phone down and pay attention to your driving, give your parents a break and tell them you love them, call a grandparent, or invite that nerdy kid who pisses you off to grab lunch or something. Enjoy it and help a few people along the way; we need a lot less assholes and more people like the OP.  Love and prayers to you and your family, bro, Wish you nothing but great days and total peace.   
What‚Äôs your favorite movie and tv series of all time ?  
You have GORGEOUS skin and eyes. Such a good looking man.üíï No questions.üòò  
How you found out you had cancer?  I mean it started to hurt somewhere and you went to hospital?  Sending you big hugs.  
What do you love to read and can I send you a book?  
I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre still answering these, but damn dude you are so strong. I had bone marrow failure at 20 (4 years ago) and had to get a transplant, then dialysis and will need a new kidney... I risked the worst a few times but was very lucky so far (and had amazing doctors). Sometimes I can‚Äôt help feeling that I‚Äôm really fragile though, and it scares me so much the thought of leaving my family and friends... my parents don‚Äôt have any other kids so... I don‚Äôt know, just meant to say you‚Äôre really strong for being able to accept your fate.  Just know that I don‚Äôt pity you, because I know it sucks when you‚Äôre the ~sick kid~ and I bet you get that enough... but I do admire you, truly, and hope the world will give you all good things for the time you‚Äôve got left.  Also props to your amazing twin sis! P.S. you‚Äôre mad cute! ;)  
I'm pretty much your age and I can't tell you how much you sharing your story and situation makes me want to better myself in every way possible. My life has been an easy ride compared to how life looks like for the majority of humans. Only in the past couple of years have I started to truly realize and empathize with how much suffering there still is in this world.  My biggest fear is not death or missed opportunities, it's becoming a literally cancerous being myself. Living beyond my means and the means of a global ecosystem with many interlocking parts that have to play a very balanced act for sustainability to be ensured. My petty ego doesn't want to look you in the eyes and deal with the reality of what your picture shows but my heart is opened and realizes it's just the most beautiful soul that could look back. Thank you, I wish you all the best.  
Diamond 1 here in rocket league. Got some tips for getting out of the rut I've been in for a month now?   
What do want us to know about you and what advice do you for people who are not likely to pass in the immediate future?  Also, I hope that you have had a happy twenty one years and when the time comes you are surrounded with love.   
I think we should all change something small to better ourselves in honor of this man. A thousand people each doing something small will have an incredible impact on the world and this man‚Äôs influence on the world will continue with these small acts from us all. People only truly die if we let them.   Sir, you are truly an inspiration. One of my biggest fears is passing without ever making a difference or achieving my goals. So I just want you to know that you‚Äôve made a major difference in my life and if I do reach my goals, it will be in large part because of you.  You set an incredible example for the people of this planet. If earth were to be destroyed and aliens only had bits and pieces to remember us by, this post is the type of stuff I hope they see.  This is how all humans should be.   
Thank you for doing this AMA and being so open, mature, and kind/patient about something so serious that is likely in all of our thoughts/feelings to some degree. I don't have any intelligent questions beyond what has already been asked and you've taken your precious time to respond. Regardless of what all of the specialized doctors have said and regardless of the prognosis, etc I can't help but see hope for you in the near term and the long term. I hope that in your case you surprise all of your family, the doctors, the most cutting edge research into cancer treatments, etc and I hope you enjoy an even longer life of happiness with a very different (and much better perspective!) than most of us.  ‚Äã Here's hoping the very best to you and your family! Thank you so much for sharing.  
First off sending prayers for you and your family.. my mom passed away from stage 4 stomach cancer about ,3 years ago. Towards the end of her life everything was so rapid. My question is, have you accepted that you are going to pass away or do you still have hope? Is ur family supportive? Sometimes I wish I had been more supportive for my mom. I feel like I accepted she was going to pass away instead of telling her she still had hope. I mean everything is possible. I wonder if I had done that if she would have fought harder. All I can say is you are brave. Anyone fighting this disease is a brave warrior.   
Favorite movie or show on Netflix?  I know you said earlier about how it makes you laugh to see people stressed and worried about the small things - I‚Äôm that person. I‚Äôm 21 too and I find myself stressed, depressed, and anxious over finding a job and being a good person. My grandma died of cancer and my mother is currently fighting it - I try to remember to be happy and put things into perspective most days.  But would love to know what you like to watch or listen to. You‚Äôre an amazing person and maybe watching/listening to something that‚Äôs close to you can help remind me to keep my head up.   
Well that fucking sucks. I hope you come back as a dire wolf. Or somebody‚Äôs puppy. Like something really happy. Or maybe you come back many millions of years ago as a tyrannosaur.  What do you want to come back as?  
How was your day?  
I'm currently studying Hospice and Palliative Care, I'm curious to know, as someone who knows your disease is likely going to be the cause of your death...how do you envision your "ideal death" who would you want to be there? do you want to die at home? is there anything you really hope to accomplish before you die? I wish you all the best and I will be keeping you in my thoughts. you are an amazing human being  
Thank you for sharing this. First, you are incredibly handsome (who looks like a movie star during chemo?! You, evidentially!) I‚Äôm a scientist by nature and education. It took a very long time for me to get even a small grip on spirituality and science is ultimately what convinced me.  At the risk of sounding cliche, and this is a sweeping oversimplification for brevity‚Äôs sake but just remember, energy can neither be created nor destroyed. The essence of who we all are is energy.  Our hearts send yours along in light and love. üíô  
What led up to you going to the doctor to eventually be diagnosed?  
How you doing today man ?   
If you become a ghost, would you haunt anyone just to fuck with them? (On a serious note, I‚Äôm very sorry about your diagnosis. You‚Äôre very handsome and seem like a great guy from your responses)  
I just wish the best for you, dude. I dont have any experience with family or friends with cancer, so im not really certain what you could do... All I can say is Godspeed, my man. Remind your family you love them, it could mean the world to them.   
What were your symptoms? Are there any warning signs others should look out for?  
[removed]  
What's the best thing people can do to make you feel more comfortable. I'm asking this because my girlfriend's cousin, a 17 year old boy  with stage 4 cancer to.  
[deleted]  
Quick question for you.  My brother in law has recently been diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. I try not to ask how he‚Äôs feeling or anything that relates to his cancer.  My reasoning is because I am sure everyone he talks to now asks him all the time. I want our conversations to be as normal as possible.  I also don‚Äôt want to come off insensitive.  What do you prefer?  I wish you and your family peace.   
Man I'm new to commenting (29 male), long time lurker. It's been a long week. Struggling with suicidal thoughts for a year. Been divorced for a year. Living my dream job (forester/wildland firefighter)...too depressed to enjoy it. Currently drunk. This post has stirred alot of emotions. Thank you OP for being so open and honest about your situation. Reminds me that we all have struggles. Your bravery and honesty are very convicting. Your post has provided alot of insight and in a way guidance about life, so thank you very much. Love ya man.  
I googled the survival rates for this type of cancer. They seem to be high. Do you know the reason why it‚Äôs low in your particular case?   
do you have to stay in the hospital 24/7?  
Late to the party, but I wanted to say that you are handling yourself with such grace. Other than that, I don't really know what to say. It sucks so much that you're going through this, and I wish I had the power to fix it. If there's anything I can do -- care package, etc. just let me know.   
Well firstly I want to say thank you for posting this, you made me realize how much of an ungrateful cunt I am for worrying about such minor things and not appreciating my life ‚Äã As for my question do you have any other bucket list things? - or did you reach a stage of being too weak now to complete them  
So sorry to hear about your shitty situation man. My family has had breast, colon, lung, sinus, and prostate cancers. I also have a lavender cancer ribbon for all cancers awareness. So I have family history and me being a firefighter top cancer is testicular cancer. My dept does cancer awareness pink shirts in October.   
[deleted]  
at this point, the biggest issue is if you are experiencing pain (mental and physical). you deserve to be living as comfortable as possible, the stigma of having a life ending disease as a young adult is a rough reality check. being the lucky 1 in 1 billion plus people to win a rare but deadly cancer diagnosis sucks. I was told last year  that I have a form of leukimia usually only seen in the elderly.it's not curable and I'm only 30.  medical cannabis is very effective against all types of cancers, I strongly recommend a daily intake of cbd and thc oil for cancer patients of all ages, the medicine directly targets unhealthy cell growth, my blood work has been notably improving and this increases my quality of life.   
First, best of luck and well wishes to you and to your family, from an internet stranger in the good ole US of A.  What have you not done in life, but plan to do before you pass? A bucket list type deal, but just your favorites.  And I am curious and haven't seen anyone ask yet. What were you doing in life before your diagnosis?  
If you don't mind me asking a more personal question. What's your thoughts on the after life? Do you believe you have an idea of what waits?  Even if you don't answer but see this, just know I think your awesome for doing this AMA and are a beautiful person who will be dearly missed.  
Hi, my mother passed away with stage 4 carcinoma in july. What have you concluded about this life and the after life?  
hey man, ill say a prayer for you and your family... if there is something specific you want me to pray for, feel free to pm me if you want.  with that said, what do you wish you could tell yourself a few years ago if you could go back in time?  
What are some of your favorite Stephen king books? For me it's probably Pet Semetary, The Shining and Lisey's Story :) Also I'd love to send you a card with a doodle and a quote from one of Stephen King's books. Just lmk if you'd be open to that and I'll pm you!   
Sure! Seems cool :D  
Have you thought about doing Cryopreservation? Also thank you for doing this, your post has helped me realize how trivial my problems really. I'm praying for you, take care friend.  
Does that mean you're dying?üò≠üò≠  
I'll be sleeping now, but tomorrow I'll continue to answer questions! Also I'm so grateful for you as community. You've granted me so much energy the last hours Be back tomorrow  
Hello. Thank you for doing this AMA! Do you feel comfortable sharing about how everything started? What where your initial symptoms? How long did it took for you to be diagnosed? What specialist you were referred to? Did you and your family felt lost or you felt support from your healthcare providers in therms is navigating the healthcare system? Where you invited to participate in research studies? How was the transition from curative to palliative care? Are you in hospice? If yes, how was the idea introduced to you and your family? How much did your care team involved your family? Do you think this made a difference for you and them?  I have more questions but I don‚Äôt want to be overwhelmed or overstep your confort level. I really appreciate the opportunity to speak with someone that is so open, and honest.  In advance, thank you!   
When‚Äôs the last time you got to pet a dog? Since you‚Äôre in hospital a lot (I assume), there really wouldn‚Äôt be that high of a chance to see a dog  
First off my thoughts are with you during this time. I hope you find some comfort, solace, laughs, and entertainment from this.  Ive always asked my older relatives whom have passed these questions but curious from a younger persons perspective too.  is there anything anyone or we could do for you during this time that you want or need?  what is the most profound or most important experience you have had over your life that taught you a lesson that others can learn from? What, if anything, would you have done differently or why wouldn‚Äôt you have done anything differently in your life? What changes over the years do you feel really have made the world a better place and what ones are you hopeful for improving the lives of your loved ones in the future?   I lost my father just over a week ago and I think the thing others will miss most is talking to you and with you about things. Enjoy genuine conversations with your loved ones and thanks for doing this. cheers   
Im also a stage 4 cancer patient.. I survived it 6 years ago and ONly MD Anderson in Texas saved me.. Please tell me you are there.   
What‚Äôs your all time favorite memory/story?   
What's your thoughts on brownies with nuts? I'm super against it. I mean get them out of there. Also.....lemon bars?   
Is cancer portrayed accurately in media?  
Have you agreed on a sign you could attempt to send your sister or parents if there is something on the other side? Like sending a bird to tap on the window or something?  
Yeah we actually do, we‚Äôve got cats and they like to be tapped on their backs. They‚Äôll react to it by raising their butts in the air. So if they do that when nobody is touching them, it‚Äôs my brother :)  
Would be funny if that worked right? :)  
[deleted]  
Hi OP! What is your favorite sub reddit and how are you doin today?   
Shit mate, not gonna lie to you. Death isn't as bad as you think it is. It sucks that it happens young, but there's no such thing as hell and you'll be going to a good fucking place. If you meet Jim, tell him I said Hi.  
What does it actually feel like to have cancer? Physically and emotionally?  Do hearing other patients success stories make you feel envious etc? Wishing you all the best. My dad has terminal cancer, but as of today he is cancer free. It will return though.   
Your tattoos are really solid. Where did you get them done?  
Have you ever made the joke that you're so good at cancer you're already on stage 4?  
What is the capital of Finland?  
Hey there!  I would like to ask you two questions.  First, do you have such thing as a ‚Äûtypical day‚Äú and if yes, what does it look like? And if not, what is an example if how your day looks like?  And second, do you have a bucket list and what does it include?  Greetings from Germany   
Death is a curious thing for me. I am not going to welcome it with open arms, but I am not going to resist it either. I guess I see it as the last frontier because no one really knows what happens.  I know youve known for a while now, but what is your take on death in general. I guess, how are you justifying it/preparing for it? I mean this in a personal level not how your family and friends are going to feel and comforting them. How are you comforting yourself?  
Are you gradually getting more comfortable with the concept of death?  How much long do they say you have left?  Do you have a bucket list? What are the top 5 things on there?  Have you ever experimented with psychedelic drugs?   
[deleted]  
Do you think the termial cancer has changed your humor, outlook on things you do, or opinions on people? Peace and love OP.  
I myself have bone cancer located on the spinal cord and I can only imagine what you‚Äôre enduring at this very moment.  I‚Äôll try to keep my question light: On a scale of 1 to nauseating how horrible is the hospital food? (My answer would be 12, from what I recall during my treatment)  
I am so sorry about your cancer, and I wish you love and support navigating through the final years of your life. I have a couple questions for you.  What is your favorite thing to do to kill time? What are some ways that you find to be able to cope with the pain?  Again, I am wishing my thoughts and prayers over to you. You are such a brave man.  
I have a friend in the same position at the same age. From your experience, what is the best things your friends can do/have done  to support you and make this time easier and enjoyable.  Also are there things friends should avoid doing when someone they care for has received a terminal diagnosis? Thank you for taking the time.  
Anyone stick a plunger to your head yet?   
Fuck and here I am crying about a girl at 23. Literally cried at work and my co workers saw. Really puts thing into perspective about how little life problems can be.  My question to you: How are you feeling? Do you struggle with relationship issues or are they just trivial little problems?  
The one time I hope this is fake. I know its not. My father passed from lung cancer (not to take away from your situation) I'm just saying I know its a bitch. No matter how lame this sounds you can still have an epic life and I think you are on to a great start. Good luck.  
How did you find out? Like did something start hurting? Always wonder how people ‚Äúknow‚Äù they have cancer without going to the doctor  
This might get lost and you won't see it, but hey dude. You're awesome.  
How you hanging in, man?   
Have you thought of doing stuff like skydiving, bungee jumping, or crazy roller coasters? For some reason I think I would do all the things I feared if I was terminally ill.  
My four year old niece was recently diagnosed with ALL. She‚Äôll be in the hospital about 4 weeks undergoing her chemo treatments and we are looking for some bald headed hero shows/movies to show her. Any recommendations?   
I'm on my 2nd recurrence of stage IV endometrial cancer. I kind of don't think there's going to be a third recurrence, given speed and symptoms. Still, I guess you never know. ‚Äã Strength and love to you, and your family as well.  
Keep on fighting!  
Damn dude.. that's rough.  Have you enjoyed your life as a ghostwriter? Do you wish you could have had some more of the limelight?  What is one of your favorite sentences you've ever read? No context necessary. Edit: a couple more questions  Is the diagnosis 100% going to kill you? Is there any chance of recovery? If so do you a set time limit or is it up in the air about when you'll pass?  
Thanks so much for asking. Let's see. I absolutely love my life as a ghost. What other opportunity does a person have to "play" a brain surgeon, an NFL quarterback, a tech guru, for a year at a time? I love the majority of my author-clients, some of whom have become close friends ... My favorite sentence ever in a classic book is "Language is a cracked kettle on which we beat out tunes for dancing bears, when we would move the stars to pity." --Gustave Flaubert, Madame Bovary, 1856 Yes, it's 100 percent going to kill me, insofar as the skull is a finite space, and the tumor will eventually start growing (we're dealing with the 20 percent of it left after surgery). HAVING SAID THAT, brain cancer science literally evolves on the daily, so there's a good chance that new and different treatment will come into use as things progress ... So I'm hopeful. Not negative--just realistic. Thanks so much for asking cool questions.  You can follow the whole adventure at amillionwordsaway.com All Best, B  
I will be keeping up with your story. Good luck.  
Oh, thanks much! You can follow the whole adventure at www.amillionwordsaway.com and patreon.com/amillionwordsaway. Sorry for the self-promotion (wink).  
You should know this: Several years ago the Federal government admitted that medical marijuana shrunk serious brain tumors. It was one of the first times the government admitted cannabis can help against cancer. I remember it specifically being about shrinking brain tumors.  I have personally known a skin cancer patient who successfully treated their skin cancer with topical cannabis ointments.  
Yeah, I've been reading a lot about the benefits of CBD in particular. I've heard it can help with cancer, esp. brain tumors. It's also good, supposedly, for headaches, which I suffer. And sleep, which can be an issue with chronic pain situations. I've experimented, but just a wee bit. Thanks so much for the note.  
I've had GREAT success using CBD oil, in tincture form, for anxiety.  Works almost as well as taking a benzo (any of the 'pams').  CDB is pretty amazing.  
Just watched a similar movie about a ill patient who is enjoying his life to the fullest and teaching people around him how to live in the time he had, that left a deep impact on me. You are an inspiration I am sure you will succeed .  
Are you sure it‚Äôs a death sentence? If yes, does knowing either way it goes you‚Äôll die make accepting your death easier? Sorry if they come off as grim  
Thanks for asking. I'm not being negative ... only realistic. They were able to get only a certain percentage of the tumor out in surgery ... The rest is too integrated in my frontal lobe ... "Like oatmeal on a rug," they say.  So ... realistically, it will start growing, and it will eat up my language skills ... eventually it will kill me. But ... There's every day new stuff going on in cancer research. The brain, in particular, tends to get a lot of attention and money for studies. So ... anything can happen. I remain hopeful and optimistic on a daily basis. But I try to live every day like it's a good day to die. (PS Not at all grim). Thanks for asking!  
Will it be nice to try some alternative diet options that may improve your situation? I heard that Keto diet does work for some people to minimise cancer/tumour. I hope you‚Äôll get better.  
Dang man that sucks, I hope you are beyond satisfied with the work that you accomplished and I wish you the best in your life <3  
I don't so much see it as a bummer, but an opportunity. I've been a successful ghostwriter for a long time, helping others' get their voices heard. It's finally a chance -- life or death / write or die -- to get my own stuff out there. I'm grateful. Not that I would wish a brain tumor on anyone else. For me, though, it's been a positive wake up call. Thanks so much for asking!  
Can I get a name for the books? And what genre? I'd love to check them out.  
It's a ghost-writer so far, I think if he tells us the names of the books the "original" writer could get backlash  
How's sleep coming?  
Wow. That's a great question. The tumor itself doesn't affect sleep, but the chronic pain -- crippling headaches -- does. I took sleeping pills for the first few years, but for the past year, I'm taking only melatonin and valerian now. Thanks for asking!  
NP. I figured in the same situation I'd be anxious as hell.  
Yeah, I get it. I don't have anxiety meaning worry. I have anxiety meaning urgency. And I wish I hadn't waited for a brain tumor to start feeling urgency. You know? ASSUME THE TUMOR, MAN! Anvils can fall out of the sky at any moment. So ... do what you must. Do what you need to do. Tell her you love her. Get out of the situation. Whatever. Thanks for commenting!  
This is phenomenal advice.  Thank you!  
Well you just changed the way I'm going about my day, thank you for this perspective. I wish you the best  
[deleted]  
This hit home, thank you.  
 ASSUME THE TUMOR  Getting these bumper stickers printed up rn   Seriously, wishing you all the best, and thank you for the great advice and example  
(:„Ñè‚ñ† –î ‚ñ† :)„Ñè I'm looking forward to reading your 12 books in 12 months!  
Godspeed man. Pour out your heart and your soul. You're up there with all the great Stoics and men who accepted their death and chose to do some good with the time they have left.  
Did the discovery of the tumor lead you to change the priority of your subjects?  
Yes, definitely. Going for more meaning, you know. Must leave a legacy before it's too late! All 12 books are in different formats and different genres. Just finishing the second one now. Thanks so much for asking!  
You're welcome! Would you like to share your subject matter here? Are you writing, fiction, memoir, graphic novels, philosophy?  
All of the above. Each of the 12 in a different genre, different format, from interactive ebook to graphic novel. War stories. Love stories. Family saga. Sci-Fi. The whole gamut! It's all fiction, though. I've made my bones as a ghost for nonfiction, with a lot of books to my credit. This is my own stuff, finally, my stories, my characters. The real me, what's inside my head (pardon the pun) finally out there for the masses ... Thanks so much for asking.  
I can tell you are an amazing writer just by how you reply to comments... ur sentences flow really well.  
Is this for real? :(  
Yes, of course. I'm OK for now (after several surgeries) but I WILL lose the ability to write -- even to speak -- at any time. I hope it'll be a while ... Thanks so much for asking.  
I hope it takes much much longer for that to happen... Can I ever read smth from you?  
Thanks so much. I hope so, too. Been a while now with no movement, so that's a good sign that it's going to be more than a year -- I hope lots more -- but it COULD happen any day. Yes, absolutely. I'm new to Reddit so please forgive me if I'm violating any kind of convention, but you can check out the whole project, including sample stuff, at my website www.amillionwordsaway.com or patreon.com/amillionwordsaway. Thanks for asking!  
Thank you too, you inspired/helped me so much already! Just started to explore your website and let me tell you I¬¥m so intrigued by this sample of the Healing Star story and so pleasantly surprised by the theme ;) Will start the reading tonight,  and need to add that I¬¥ll keep this story with your name on it for as long as I have a physical space to keep my stuff or as long as I live (I¬¥ll print at least my fav pages) I¬¥m that kind of a person who associates moments, people and life lessons to some type of object gotten at the moment, given by the person etc etc my collection of objects it¬¥s one of my most important things in life, so thank you for making a part of it and for having such an important message encapsulated inside the pages.  
What books have you written before?  
Been a ghost, so the vast majority don't have my name ... But a few do. I write mainly medical books, but also business, science, celebrity, sports, entertainment, parenting, military, etc. I've spent a helluva lot of time and energy -- gratefully, happily -- helping others get their voices and their messages heard. Now I have this wake-up call reminding me that my own thoughts matter. All my stories, all my characters, and all my ideas ... all in 1 million words ... out to the universe, in one year. Thanks for asking!  
Me and my girlfriend are reading this, amazing, so brave! We will be following this, and giving those books a read! Ill pass on your story.  
Thanks so much! That's awesome. You can check it all out (sorry I'm new to Reddit, so hope I'm not breaking some convention) at amillionwordsaway.com and patreon.com/amillionwordsaway. Thanks again.  
Whats the series gonna be called? I'll buy them  
My nigga. Do the work. All I want to ask is where can I buy them?  
I just want you to know how much I respect you. After reading your responses to questions and comments. You seem like an amazing individual and I will keep you in my prayers. I hope to read your books one day. Best of luck to you  
How will you speak?  
Yeah. Scary question, right? Thanks for asking. The tumor -- nicknamed "Ollie" -- is on language expression, which is in a different part of the brain than language comprehension. Which means I should be able to still understand speech. Just not USE it. For now, I'm practicing all kinds of workarounds for my aphasia (word finding challenges). The brain's a miraculous and complex place, and I can feel the "neuroplasticity" in action on a daily basis. We're wondering whether I'll be able to use sign language or singing after speech goes kaput ...  
Wait, what? It might be possible to sing after you've lost the ability to speak? That is fascinating. Are those abilities not located in the same part of the brain? Is there a medical term for this that I could use to learn more?  
u/IanBlakeNewhem please look into music therapy! Music connects to more parts of your brain than just language expression, so it‚Äôs totally a possibility that you could form some new neural pathways via a musical work around. Feel free to dm me if you want to follow up about this - I‚Äôm a student so I don‚Äôt have all the answers, but I am super passionate about this career, and I think it could help you!  
One of my favorite video game characters, who's a silent protagonist, uses a tape recorder to communicate with others rather than actually speaking. He uses fitness guides, language learning audiobooks, airline PA'S,etc. Would you do something like that? (Shout out to anyone who knows who this is and what game they're from)  
What is the most important line or passage you've written? What's something you've written that has really made you stop and think? I feel for you.  
Whats the biggest thing you are gonna miss about writing? Like the Creative Part or the ‚Äûi can‚Äòt tell what i feel but i can Write it‚Äú Part?  
[removed]  
Do you have the ideas for all 12 books yet?  
Why not just write one really good book?  
I just checked out your website and I'm so excited to read your books. As a lgbt teen I love seeing more books bring written about that type of subject. I really do hope you can fulfill your goal! <3  
best memories? favorite music?  
I don‚Äôt have any questions, I just wanna say that your attitude about your condition is really motivating and inspiring. I hope you do well in all that you do, and I hope that it gets better for you. You‚Äôre a really good quality human being. Good luck on your twelve books, I hope I can read all of them! :)  
I mean this in the most respectable way: are you planning to go out in a hospital, or your own terms when you've finished this goal?  
Kills you...literally?? If so, thats a large, depressing thought to carry around with you all the time.  
Where will your books be available?  
What‚Äôs your favorite genre to read/write? And also, if you were given the chance to turn any fantasy novel into real life, would you? If so, what book would it be?  
I‚Äôm so sorry to hear this man, really good to hear you‚Äôre finding the light in the dark. Where can we find your work after it‚Äôs written? I‚Äôd love to read some of it.  
What is your favourite genre to write?  
Do you feel more inspired in terms of writing stories now? Have you already figured what all the stories will be about?  
A million words in 12 months, thats ~3,000 words a day! Do you have any plans for what you will write?  
How were you diagnosed?  
I'm a creator and I tend to get overwhelmed with deadlines because I'm a perfectionist. Wanted to give you something to think about that killed a lot of writer's blocks for me. "Don't let perfect be the enemy of good."  
What are you basing said success on?  
Hi. It's not a question but I really appreciate you posting this. I have written a number of novels first draft  and have many more to write but I put it off, procrastinate and get bored of trying to edit them. I really want to have the energy to complete them so that I can try to get published or at least have finished works that my family can read after I'm gone but I just dont sit and do it. You have literally been diagnosed with something I fear happening to me, which prevents me from doing what I really want to do. I'm going to stop life from getting in the way and use my spare time properly. Thank you for sharing this and you are an inspiration. I hope you manage to write it all and be remembered for your books.  
Your a legend, I have been having major migraines since my concussion 3 years ago and they haven't told me anything new in the 2 years of different doctors. All of them just want me to do scans but they never end up giving me one so I'm in a loop. So this doesn't get taken down, here's my question... What was it like when you first found out and are people treating you different, because people sure as hell don't care about it for me and just hit me in the head or some shit that ends up giving me a night of displeasure just from contact  
This isn‚Äôt a question but I recently lost a loved one to a brain tumor that also affected her speech.  It was hard seeing her struggle with that, especially with her family immediate family and I wish you and your loved ones the best.  But I wanted to say that while the loss of speech is a tough thing to go through (understatement), you‚Äôll still be able to communicate through looks and mannerisms. I‚Äôm not trying to say ‚Äúhey, everything will be alright!‚Äù I‚Äôm just trying to say that, there will be times when you can‚Äôt put what you‚Äôre thinking into words and there will be times when your loved ones may not completely understand you but there will be many more times when you do something so small like rolling your eyes at a corny joke and your loved ones will know exactly what you would say if you could put the words together.  I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôm coming across but I guess I‚Äôm trying to say that, even without speech, there will be so many good, wonderful, loving moments and ‚Äúconversations‚Äù you will have with your loved ones over this time. Moments they‚Äôll cherish.  You have a tough road ahead but I still hope and believe that you and your loved ones have many more happy memories to make, regardless of how you communicate during them.  
Reading through the questions asked, as well as your answers, I wish you the best of luck. It seems that you have written about pretty much everything one can imagine! As an author, knowing your words will live on forever in the pages of so many books, and spark the imagination of the young and old alike, must be an amazing feeling! Im relatively new to Reddit as well, and I'm grateful for posts like this, it will make one think of their own mortality, and thank you for sharing! Is there a time frame on the progression of the tumor? Or, is it somewhat of a "ticking timebomb?" Thank you again for sharing your story.  
So how long are u expected to live?  
I was diagnosed with CLL when  I was only 23. They said because of the amount in my bone marrow I was probably going to need a BMT within the year, even tho CLL is usually really slow. I have no biological sibilings and am a mix of races so my match pool is bad. and GVHD usually kills. I ended up getting a clinical trial, avoided the BMT and I have been cancer free for a little more than 2 years. I know your situation is more grave but I know what it feels like to have to be realistic about the situation and how you have to put yourself in this hopeful, but also come to terms sort of weird mental limbo state of constant appreciation for your life while simultaneously feeling stress and anxiety and just trying to come to terms with it. Idk what to say, i never knew what anyone could say to me to make me feel better in this situation. At least you are good with words :) Keep on keeping on! Write those books. Give it your all! You can do it!!!!  
Have you decided on the topics of all 11 remaining books?  
Thank you for doing this AMA. I want to start writing again.  
I‚Äôm not sure if you are familiar with David Menasche - he wrote an autobio called ‚ÄúThe Priority List‚Äù based on an assignment that he had with his students at Coral Reef High School in Miami.  He was also my hockey coach.  He found out he had a rare form of brain cancer and passed a few years ago.  I never got a straight answer from him concerning knowing exactly how protracted his time may be and what that did to his psyche. Most of us don‚Äôt even have an idea of when our last day is, but you do and yet, you are oddly at peace.  What gets you past that memento mori; that reminder that you will die soon? I appreciate you being candid with your ailment and FUCK CANCER.  
What‚Äôs are the twelve books going to be about? Do you have a solid plan, or a loose one and you‚Äôre going with the flow?  
Man that's tough... I'm so sorry. What are your books about?  
I am a writer as well. I would do the same in your position. I have left temporal lobe epilepsy and a malformation (stable it appears)  in my right temporal lobe. Never let go until you can breath. Leave a mark on this world, and make every word count.  I hope to read your books one day. I will make sure to remember your work. I can relate so much to you. Please, if you want, keep in contact.  
Please update us if you publish the books, I would love to read them. Sending good energy!  
Jesus man, my regards What was your first thought when you were diagnosed? If it isn't too personal?  
Best wishes man, this is an amazing story. I want to be a writer someday too, so I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre embracing it in the little time you have left.  
What‚Äôs your name? What are you writing about? Are you depressed? How are you handling it? Edit: I assume your username is your actual name  
[removed]  
I love reading, I have my whole life, and I don't have a question but I want to thank you. Maybe I've read one of your books, maybe I haven't but thank you for creating content to make others like myself happy.  
Wait. You‚Äôre dying? I‚Äôm really sorry  
What would u say this will affect your happiness? Have you had any depressive symptoms due to this?  
Have you dealt with any writer‚Äôs block during this time? If so, how have you overcome it? What‚Äôre you writing about? What are your feelings on this whole thing? Are you scared? Sad? Angry? Accepting?  
What do you regret most?  
I'm very sorry to hear about your brain tumor. I can't imagine how shocking that must have been to find out. Your dedication to write 12 books is inspiring.  Ater reading your post I feel I must share my perspective with you. But first I must share a little about me so that you may decide whether or not my perspective is valuable to you.  ... I grew up in an agnostic, liberal environment in suburban USA. I went through the public school system and for most of my life I followed the rules, desired to fit it, and accepted everything I was told as the truth. I was self-centered, emotionally suppressed, and expecting the material world to make me happy. I felt a deep desire to be famous, rich, and charismatic.  When I was 18 my oldest brother killed himself and I was the one who found him. A year later my girlfriend of 3 years cheated on me.  After all of the heartache, depression and thoughts of suicide I eventually decided something needed to drastically change in my life. I just didn't know what. This led me down a rabbit-hole of 3+ months researching into everything I could possibly learn about our reality. I compiled evidence of everything I found valuable. I was so obsessed with my research and my perspectives changed so quickly my parents thought I was losing my mind and threatened to put me in a mental hospital. And after questioning my sanity for the first time in my life I learned a valuable lesson. I learned that a man who has questioned his reality is far more sane than a man who has never questioned his reality before. ... What I would like to share with you is the last thing I learned after my research-binge which has completely changed my life a year later.  You may choose to disregard it, accept it as the truth, or research it to form your own opinion. That is up to you. I am simply sharing this knowledge with you because I believe it to be fact based off of my own research and experience and because I feel you deserve to know it. ... We are the creators of our reality. What we believe, we create.  We are a single, connected conciousness "playing" different characters for our growth and entertainment. Our ego (the source of selfish desire) is an illusion. This is what Jesus and Buddha (as well as many other enlightened individuals) have taught thousands of years ago and what our science is now pointing to. When we create a feeling in our bodies (a frequency of energy) we attract like energy to us. This is referred to as the "law of attraction" by many. And it is no pseudoscience. It is supressed science. Certain individuals do not want the masses to know of this law of attraction so that they can profit from our ignorance.  Many have used this law of attraction to heal themselves. Even cancer.  The key is to "feel as if your prayers (desires) are already answered without hidden motive" - Gregg Braden, Divine Matrix Seminar, Dead Sea Scrolls To desire something implies you do not have that thing. Thus creating suffering. In order to create healing, we must feel as if we are already healed through active visualization. This is how Buddhist monks pray. They ground themselves to the present moment and focus on loving thoughts and feelings.  ... My question for you:  Wouldn't one book about the story of writer who miraculously healed themselves be far more valuable than twelve? I don't expect you to answer it. Just food for thought üôÇ‚ô•Ô∏èüôè  
What kind of books are you going to write?  
I can't really process being in a situation like this, but what I can say is it sounds like you've developed yourself and made good use of your time. Being able to devote oneself to anything is a gift  and having that help others makes it that much more beautiful. You've contributed and made the world better because of it.  
How do you stay so positive knowing that you're gonna die?  
How's your week been?  
What books did you write?  
Sorry if this comes out rude but, reflecting on your life and all, do you have any regrets in your life, like wishing you were able to live it out more?  
I followed you on Instagram! I love what you are doing. You are doing what anyone would consider LEGENDARY. I absolutely believe in you and I will be following your journey. Sending lots of love and good wishes!  
Damn, as an aspiring author myself that's appsolutely terrifying- good on you for pushing though it and creating something before you go. Do you have all 12 books planned out or are you just writing as you go?  
Considering the circumstances, do you feel happy and motivated even though you know you have been ‚Äúsentenced‚Äù to death? Also good luck on your journey my friend, I wish you the best!  
Can we be best friends? My name is Ethan by the way, and my grandma died before I was born.  
how do.you deal with the limited time you have left on the planet?  
I love this culminating project you have embarked upon.   What are topics are you most passionate about?  How does one go about narrowing it down in such a situation?  
I don't have any questions. I just wanted to say I'm am so, so sorry. This made me tear up. My grandma passed a week ago from brain tumors.  It's a terrible thing and I would never wish this on anyone. I just wish you the best of luck and I will be thinking of you.  
I wish you the best of luck. I have had many brushes with death and have emerged stronger. I am also an author. I just finished my latest book.  I find that the mind is a truly fascinating thing. You can convince yourself of anything. Truly believe and your biggest goals will be achieved.  
There are breakthroughs happening all the time in relation to tumours. Maybe see if you can get on an experimental trial. Best wishes for you.  
What are your 12 books about?  
Do you have a publisher for it? And what‚Äôs the series titled? Also do you need an illustrator?  
Please, make sure that you read the Quran or educate yourself about Islam. Maybe you will know that it is the true religion.  
What are the books on Edit: when r they being published bc I really want to read those they sound very interesting and exiting  
Have you tried cbd or other medical cannabis stuff? If so does it really help with the pain? Ps:if you time is counting down, make it worth!  
That‚Äôs terrible, so sad to hear that. F  
May I ask what books you‚Äôve written?  
[deleted]  
What's something you want people to remember you for?  
I‚Äôll read every word! You‚Äôve got this  
That is a damn plot for a novel, or movie! Your life story will be told and heard!  
Hey, this is an incredible story - I‚Äôm amazed.  How did you decide on 12 books and why?  
[deleted]  
How does it feel knowing your going to die? Wish you well  
So. What do you write about? How much time do you have left ( estimate). Is it hard living day to day knowing the limited future you might have? How do people react when/ if you tell them about your condition? Has your condition changed your relationship with others around you? ( sorry for your condition. Thank you for doing this)  
As a practicing Stoic, your approach to all this is laudable, and frankly hits all of the key concepts of Stoicism (yes yes, my own confirmation bias, of course). But memento mori is there, right along with amor fati. As a writer (going through the publishing process right now with my first book), you‚Äôve struck a fear I‚Äôve had. Though I‚Äôve honestly worried most about losing the use of my hands, as I could not create the same way if I had to speak or use eye-tracking. So my fear has not been one of death, but of my hands not being able to fly over a keyboard. Of course, humans are nothing if not adaptable. But that is a paltry fear compared to how you‚Äôve comported yourself in this. But in that, your story is quite visceral and real to me, because of that fear, because of that similar enslavement to the written word, and because of your wonderful and pure approach to it all. I don‚Äôt have a question here, but rather I wish you all the best in the twelve and for science to get off its ass and give you a stay. Glad to see the books already taking fruition on the site, and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm going to support just as soon as I stop typing this. Respect and all the best wishes.  
Have you exhausted all options for surgery? Have you adapted your lifestyle to perhaps reduce the growth of the tumor? There is early science showing a ketogenic diet and fasting both help in this way, but perhaps it doesn't apply to your tumor type... good luck man  
This is very much a tough question, and please don't feel obliged to answer- When you realise you're getting into your final days (losing motor skills, struggling to speak etc), do you think you will consider taking your own life as opposed to struggling with said tumour for however long it may take? Will you stick it out in hopes of a breakthrough, do you have any instructions for spouse/family/friends you would be willing to share? I'm dreadfully sorry for what's happened to you, but I admire your taking light from the darkest of situations, its inspirational- keep it up!  
I'm unsure if you're the Ian Blake Newhem on Amazon, but I'd like to support your writing by perhaps reading some of your earlier works.  This is a very dire situation, and I wish you the best on your journey, but I've had the same sort of ideology for myself if I ever found out I had a disintegrating disease as an artist.  To create as much as you can before the end, to get your voice and stories heard and shared.   I wonder if you're 12 books will be a series, or perhaps a memoirs of your journey through live, or maybe a retelling of your memoirs through a fictional story that can have themes of dying peacefully, doing what you loved.   Do you have any themes set for your books?  
Can we write one together? Also I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm doing care for a family member right now. 3 hour feedings, even at night I wake up, twice. I leave for the Navy in 3 weeks. Feel lost at times, I know nobody wants to take care of her as good as I am. To have this feeling...it sucks. I feel like she‚Äôd live longer and better in my care....and to pass while I‚Äôm not there...when I‚Äôve been the main caretaker...omg it‚Äôs eating me alive. Live while you can. Always look at clinical trails. See if you qualify for any.  
[deleted]  
How do you escape that fear of death or of being unable to do what you once could? I have my own medical issues that present a possible future issue and it scares me to death, I don't know how you deal with that kind of mourning so well. Much respect to you, and I hope you finish what you've set out to finish!  
A friend of mine just told me he had a cancerous brain tumor This really sucks  
How old are you?  
Do you need a hug? I'll give you a hug if you need it  bro.  
I don‚Äôt have any questions, all I want to say is that I know cancer is terrible. I‚Äôve lost family to it. I can never understand your pain or hurt in this matter but I can empathize. I‚Äôm sorry that life gave you this. I wish you luck in all your endeavours. And if it means anything, one random guy on the Internet now has a place in their heart for you. ‚ù§Ô∏è  
That sounds like a movie plot. And i have absolutely no idea how to properly say i wish you do well.Like, have a happy rest of your life?That sounds like something a murderer would say. Have a good writing time?Maybe,idk. Good luck?(that makes me shiver since now im questioning life just by imagining being in your situation.This made me question, "good luck on what?".And then, this line of thought brings me back to the "have a happy rest of your life", since that fits better with the situation.) Anyways, be happy! That's the best i have.  
What was the first thought that came into your head when you heard that you had the tumor, and were inevitably going to die?  
Oh God, I‚Äôm so sorry about that!   You must always remember that you rock and did all you could for as long as you could.  
Do you think real beauty is forever? To what degree do you believe in immortality? Do you believe in creating or any other act we can draw near the eternally living?  I wish that you may keep your light as you speechlessly,  but ever conscious approach the original darkness.  
I‚Äôm so sorry this is happening to you and am glad to hear that you aren‚Äôt too beaten by this.  Do the doctors know how this happened though? Is it just a completely random occurrence?  
Im a  hopefull, writer, but progress has only been 11,000 words since febuary, any advice on writing?  Im quite good at general description, and I love world building and lore, but I can't get the hang of describing fight scenes and I keep on changing my mind about plot points.  
Steven King 20 books ago?  
Who's your favorite author and which book by her/him is your favorite?   What's your favorite book by a different author?  
I feel so sorry that your great ability is about to leave this world, hope that you find peace beyond this world So I just want a bit of advice What to you think about cliches, recently in my reading class we had a creative writing project and a friend of mine got an F from the teacher for "to much cliches", are cliches bad stuff?  
I just want you to know, that we are all behind you. You are truly inspirational. Taking such a horrible situation and accepting it, twisting it around and making the most of life. You will go down in history, Reddit history, our history. Good luck with everything and I wish you the best in the afterlife, whether you believe in it or not.  
NaNoWriYe?  
What pushed you into writing? Who was/is your idol, or the person who inspired you?  
What books have you written?  
If you had to pick one thing, what do you think caused the tumor?  
Inoperable? Or you would prefer to do these books rather than risk it?  
Do they know what causes Ollie?  
How many times have you failed before you were successful?  
If there was one thing you could say to me, what would it be?

Ever take acid or mushrooms? I recommend it. It may be a very positive experience for you.  
In one of your replies, you said you'll be able to understand language but not be able to use it.  Does that mean you can learn sign language to communicate or will you not be able to use that?

You might have finished answering questions since I'm so late to this AMA but I was wondering if you were planning on writing about your journey through this experience. I don't mean to sound morbid, but would you consider writing something chronicling your cognitive decline? It would be fascinating, especially since you are so well written and seem rather knowledgeable about the medical portion.  
Hope all is good man‚ù§Ô∏è

Not really a question but I do wish you the best 12 months :)

Thanks  
 Want to link me to your account there? I'm a poweruser on Reddit and I can probably tell you what you did wrong.  From Saydra's digg account: http://digg.com/users/LisaDroesdov/history/comments  
See here http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/a7e2s/what_do_you_think_about_redditors_that_are_gaming/  
Man, this reddit is absolutely useless.  And this post throws me over the edge, watch close while I unsubscribe.  
I'm keeping it +frontpage'd just so I can watch the ridiculous drama. It's Reddit's personal soap opera.  
Srsly. No interviews, no posts, and then this sterling example of 100% pure Grade-A bullshit drama manufacturing. Top it off with an insane mod who threatens people's privacy and you got yourself one less subreddit that's on my front page.  
For some reason it marks most of the submissions as spam.  
http://imgur.com/5snuH.jpg  
Its like beating a dead horse, reddit wants her to continue to spam reddit.  
You know what guys? All this kerfuffle is pretty dumb. Saydrah's been a productive member of this community for longer than most. That she happens to work in social networking shouldn't count against her, unless you can give me legitimate proof that she's somehow gamed the system. And as far as her being a "power user", well yeah, she kind of is. She submits more links than the average user, and comments more, so she's got name recognition. She moderates a couple of popular subreddits, but then, so does Karmanaut, heartfence, and qgyh2...but I hear nothing about their misdeeds. All of this is getting stirred up because MMM got pissy after getting let go as a mod from IAMA, and because internets are really super serious business, he considered it a level and coolheaded idea to threaten the privacy and anonymity of IAMA submitters. Read that again, and then tell me why anyone is jumping to his defense? The guy lost the moral high ground the very instant he decided he would make that threat.   
I agree. Working in social media doesn't make you inherently evil.   
I like how reddit refuses to consider this a valid opinion.  
First, who cares? Second, this isn't an AskMe post. Don't waste our time.  
I for one care. Can't fucking stand the idea of mods using their power for ANYTHING other than banning spam. That whole IAMA fiasco last week was Saydrah's doing. Shit like that shouldn't be possible. Fucking mods can ban comments without the poster even knowing is fucking disgusting.  
You know the best way to make things right? Get a fucking exclusive on ASKME! Get someone that everyone wants to hear from. Make it more popular. Most users don't give a shit which subreddit or who is posting GOOD content. We go to interesting topics. I upvote and downvote comments and never look at the name of the poster. Never. Unless of course someone mentions novelty account or nice username in the thread.  
 BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWW  FTFY.  
Your comment would make a lot more sense if I was someone banned/kicked/whatever by Saydrah - which I'm not.  At least not yet. So let me ask you this, do you not care at all about any of the points shown here? link.  If not, why not (I'm asking in earnest)?  
I honestly couldn't care less if Saydrah set small Rwandan children on fire for a living.  Newsflash! Moderator selection isn't democratic. Karma whores invariably post things people want to read- whether they're being paid or not.  No objection whatsoever /shrugs This isn't Digg- each user's votes have the same weighting, and the "Friends" system is far more cumbersome. The culture's very much against the idea of "HEY EVERYONE I JUST POSTED X VOTE IT UP". She can't do any harm.  
I'm pretty sure he's a mod, which means he can flag competing posts to his as spam and get them removed, which is pretty lame in my opinion.  
your posting to askme would make a lot more sense if you were someone banned/kicked/whatever by saydrah. well, actually, it wouldn't, but it would be something that could perhaps see sense by standing on tiptoe and using binoculars.  
And to think I gave this subreddit a shot.  You guys have fun being bitter.  
I can kind of see where you're coming from, but she's done nothing against the rules. The material she submits doesn't even hint that she would have an advantage over other users like a press pass, or inside source. The more you submit the more your name gets seen, and people get comfortable and trust upvoting your submissions. It may take awhile at the start but just submit more articles. She submits between 10-20 submissions on average.  
Don't get me wrong - I don't care if you're submitting links to promote your site.  As far as I'm concerned, that's just reddit working as intended.  What I'm against is moderators who have a vested interest in social media.  A moderator is supposed to be a fair arbitrator of the rules.  Obviously, being the enforcer, they're not subject to the same rules (they can do speed posting, for instance).  That's fine.  But you cross that line when you start using your modding ability to do self-promotion, silence dissenters, etc.  It seems like that's what Saydrah is doing.  
I'm not sure why you think that. As a mod, you cannot:  Self-Promote Speed post Silent dissenters (i.e. cancel out down-votes)  You can ban users, but it won't do any good because it is discussed among all the mods before a ban is placed, and the ban lists are not long at all. Edit: Not sure why I'm being downvoted for sharing information about how the system works.  
 Silent dissenters (i.e. cancel out down-votes)   you can ban users, in fact you can ban them in such a way they don't even know they're banned - their submissions and comments just do't show up.  
Yes it's possible, but the ban lists are only a few users long. I know that she hasn't been banning every single user just to get herself to the 'top' of an arbitrary news aggregate website. What you are saying is true, but I fail to see what correlation it has with the fact that Saydrah just spams until something takes. Look at her submissions, a lot of them sit at under 10. Just like everyone, she has good streaks and vacant streaks. She just submits so much, and is outspoken in the community that many people recognize her. I don't know what to tell you. You guys seem bitter and resentful.  
You can ban users from a specific subreddit, sure. You can't ban them from the site as a whole unless you're a reddit admin.  
You can ban comments without the poster even knowing. That kind of fucked up shit is just that, fucked up shit.  
It is fucked up shit but what does it have to do with karma?  
Being a mod of a particular subreddit does allow you to speed post. You are not subject to tripping the spam filter, nor do you have a time limit when submitting more then 2 articles.  
I believe submitting multiple articles has to do with your karma not being a mod. It keeps brand new accounts (temp spammers) from doing just that.  
 I can kind of see where you're coming from, but she's done nothing against the rules.  Indeed, she's exceedingly good at staying within the rules. But the thing is, I see her name come up an awful lot when reddit drama happens--especially when it comes to moderator-type drama.  Why is that?  
I can only think of one instance.  Do you have links to the other 'drama'?  
You're taking the internet too seriously.  
This is stupid.  
STFU  
What's your favorite type of dick?  
Spotted dick.  
Thanks for reminding us that Michael Jackson died.  
Interestingly enough, in Newfoundland they call 'spotted dick' 'figgy duff'.  
My own, I suppose.  
Kinky.  
Is /r/AskMe going to be anything more than a /r/WhineAboutIAmA?  
Impossible to answer that question at this time. Do a proper submission.  
Yes. It wont last long.  
Why is your post showing up but mine isn't? Is it because I didn't rebel against IAMA? And instead just started using this as /r/IAMA?  Ridiculous. MMM is one of the few (7) people I have on my friend list, and yet..... this pisses me off.  
Spam filter, maybe? Send a mod a PM.  
There is no mod.  
um hmm really? huh.  
Yeah, I can see this subred is going places...  
where's your mod now?!  
...uh oh.  
CSS or reddit spam rule.  I hope MMM leaves his CSS tinkering to another r/ until he gets it in production form.  
Ayy lmao  
Who do you like to make the Final Four in college basketball this year? A lot of interesting teams and no single dominant squad like UNC in 2008-09.  
I gotta go with the Capital City Athletes, although the Racial Epithets are really looking to come into their own if they stick to it.  
What was the answer to your question?  
He never answered. But in fact, only me and one other person actually asked him questions, everyone else just gave him advice. My question was sarcastic, because I had just suggested that he really ought to make an AskReddit post rather than an IAmA, since he was basically saying "I'm gay and in high school and have no idea what to do. AMA.".  
Who do you consider to be the worst: Stalin, Hitler, President Bush (either one), Chairman Mao, Osama Bin Laden or the IAMA mods?  
what about palin, shocking that you left her off your list  
I didn't want to stray into the realm of the ridiculous.  
I haven't seen the threads, and though I think your banning does sound unreasonable, you should probably have expected questions of this nature to be received differently by some "gay kid" versus a self-described "closet slut".  
Sure, but the question received 60 downvotes... it's clear that it was disapproved of, but it certainly wasn't "faggot faggot faggot die you fag" or anything banworthy. I WAS eventually unbanned weeks later after being ignored by mod after mod until I finally found one willing to be reasonable. It still took another few weeks after that.  
Is MMM sucking your dick so that you will make his "rebel AMA" popular? I remember defending you on the gay kid question by the way.   
No, I just saw that there'd been no postings, and the last time I made this sort of thing in IAmA, it was simply downvoted.  
There was another one by a guy who works at a specialty beer store, but it looks like it disappeared.   
This subreddit was created before IAmA was, btw.  
Warning: asking questions in /r/IAmA to a minority that are offensive may get you banned. But it's okay to be disrespectful to pro-life protestors.  
I must admit, that shit pisses me off. If people insist on being disrespectful, I would prefer it to be universal.  
Do you like fishsticks?  
Well, sure, I guess. They taste alright.  
I demand to get banned from a subreddit.    
I want to be banned too, maybe then I'll be one of the cool kids...  
I was born at a very young age  
Every 60 seconds, a minute passes in Africa. Together we can stop this  
You‚Äôre really pulling this crap  
U just made me question my hole fucking life üòÇ  
Actually I was the youngest person in the world  
Lol  
Gonna ask me something?  
Nah, I thought it was a legitimate funny joke  
Oh Ok  
how i was born only being 10  
Wow. How could you deal with fame?  
I haven't thought about that *shocked look\*  
do you like the taste of apple sauce  
Never tried it  
I like Garfield  
I WAS THE YOUNGEST PERSON  Lyaliear  
should circumcising a newborn be illegal?  
IDK  
What if the newborn didn't give express consent?  
Its family does.  
How did you find out you had it?  
When we were in norway on our way home to sweden, i coughed lots by the borders, so they took this nose test on me and bang! I had corona and i was shocked because i though i was a champion  
(kind of a stupid question) Did you have to take any medication?  
No not me, but my grandma got it too and she had a whole table of meds  
Hey, I'm in India and was in contact of a person who has tested positive. I don't have any symptoms as of yet (I do feel fatigued) so the government hasn't allowed me to get tested but I'm pretty anxious at the moment. How do you feel after recovering?  
The government doesn't allow you to get tested? The government controls the doctors?  
The government of my state had a testing guidelines in place last month that required labs to test ONLY those people who had ILI (Influenza like illness) symptoms/ were above 65 and had come in contact since testing kits were limited. They've amended those now and anyone can get an RT-PCR test for Rs. 2400 (32 USD)  
What was the hardest thing while knowing you had the virus?  
Does it cause pain in your body or it's just fever..??  
Did you lose any sense of taste or smell? If yes, how long did it last and have you recovered?  
How old are you?  
I hate you.  
? For getting sick ?  
Do you have any sidon?  
Are you still dealing with side effects today? Cough etc..  
How does the test feel (like, the tampon)? I heard it's not pleasant  
Ah me too how was your experience?  
You clear of corona? How does it feel?  
What was the recovery time for you?  
Me to:)  
Crazy... I am ready for the 2nd time LOL  AMA  
What've been womens' reactions to this? (or men, if you're gay).  Did you let them know beforehand?  
I'm jealous, you should share one of those with men like me  
I see what you did there  
For a long time I was ashamed of it. I had numerous conversations with doctor's to understand if there was any way to remove it. I was told that because it was basically, "not for show", in other words, "part of the plumbing", that to remove it would be the equivilent of castration. So after years of being ashamed as a young man, I finally came out about it. (I am probably the only guy in the world who was a virgin because he has an extra nut.) Now I call it my spare. Its funny because the small population of women I have been with have always been fascinated by it. Of course, I've always told them about it upfront. I've never tried to hide it, I always figure that would be weird.  
Do you wish you had a third hand so you could scratch them better?  
Are you a Ballchinian?  Because that would be awkward.  
It's a 3-T Scroat!  
perhaps you could have a threesome with a fellow redditor with one testicle.   
My wife said earlier today when referring to John McClain:  "He has lots of balls".  I corrected her and said "No, he has very large balls.  Two, very large balls." I'm not sure how my post is relevant, but know that somehow it is.  I think I mean to say, you are not John McClain.  
how did you find out this was not "normal"?  how do your sexual partners, if you'd had any, react? consider doing a /r/gonewild  
I would nickname my cumshots "BP."  
Is the third one fully functional? Do you have hormone issues due to extra testosterone? Does this affect your choice in underwear?  
Fully functional and plumbing works. As far as testosterone, no issues there. I wish I could say it made me more manly sounding, gave me a deeper voice, or thicker hair on my chest. Alas, the amount of extra testosterone in my system is not sufficient to make me more daring or manly, in any way. The downs do outweigh the ups, as I have to be careful how I package things. I tend to wear briefs because I can bring my package out, giving it a comfortable resting place. I have tried boxers and the problem with them was that they let me hang straight down, and when that happens my stuff tends to get beat up pretty good.   
Have you ever contemplated that awful joke story about that guy with 3 balls who went in to bars betting between him and the bartender had 5 balls or something along those lines? (sadly that was the first thing that came to mind)  
maybe a perfect time to learn a new skill? Sounds pretty boring to me but it's the same for everyone here at NY since we are number one state with COVID-19 cases.  
I hope you're able to go outside and spend a little time in nature. Is the area very different from where your home is?  
Hey Met, it is very different from my hometown. It's very lovely here. I get out and hike/bike ride each day. The thought of loneliness brings me back to my hotel where I just scroll on my phone. How are you?  
I'm doing ok. I've been wfh for a few years and I am not happy about it. I was planning on moving to a new job this spring but that's not happening. In a place where I'd have a lot of time I'd be looking for a hobby - have you considered bird watching while you're out? What I'm feeling now is everything being the same day to day and productivity is falling. I'm thinking of starting some online courses once I meet some work objectives. What are you doing to keep up?  
Sorry to hear about your plans changing. Bird watching is an excellent hobby. I've been an avid bird watcher for 4-5 years now. It definitely helps slow down and appreciate nature more. The adrenaline rush of spotting new species is what really attracts me to it. And that's what I'm going to do today, thank you! Also funny you mentioned online courses, I've been debating taking a Spanish course. What time of work do you do at home?  
Do you ride bmx if not that‚Äôs you‚Äôre problem bmx or skateboarding is how you save you‚Äôre self mentally.  
I've been itching to build another bmx bike lately. I have a pretty nice downhill bike with me that I love. Are you skating or riding?  
Mainly bmx but sometimes MTB I‚Äôm the woods because my dads friends with the person who owns it so we build our own private jumps and trails but I do ride triles and enduro motocross bikes and I can skate a little bit but I prefer bike but fuck scooters  
What's the wildest things you have ever done  
Great question. Hiking 7 miles up mountains and around glaciers in Antarctica with the son of the first person to summit Mt. Everest was pretty awesome.  
And while you are alone in the hotel try and do the sleeping beauty. Just to spice up some things üòÇüòÇ  
I don‚Äôt know why, but I get a feeling you‚Äôre a builder/DIY type of person.  If you got a personal computer, or a work computer , if you‚Äôre allowed to download programs to it, you can always download blender Lately when I feel the itch to build something, I just model it out and work out the kinks until I‚Äôm satisfied with it. I figured when this quarantine is over then I‚Äôll have a good amount of projects to be able to pull from.  So far my list is pretty long, but some of them are.  (Airplane safe) Adaptive optics for a Dobson telescope.  A pc case Kinetic sculpture Mouse car based on a kinetic sculpture.   Some other stuff aswell.  
Why?  
The sound puts me in fight or flight mode and sets off a panic attack. Not sure why though.  
Oh.  
Have you seen a professional about this?  
It didn‚Äôt seem like that big of a deal so I haven‚Äôt.  
It really is, you should find out the history of this panic and get rid of it.  
What sound do you mean? Like, taking a bite of an apple?  
Slicing, peeling, and biting all scare me and occasionally the sliding of two pieces of apple against each other.  
When did it start?  
I‚Äôve had it for as long as I can remember but it‚Äôs usually just been flinching up until around 2-3 years ago  
Do you like the taste of apples?  
They‚Äôre okay, not a huge fan of them  
Funny... The sound apples make have a strange effect on me too. It makes my face muscles scrunch up like I'm disgusted. I'm not, but I cannot control it. Only the sound of slicing apples does this.  
What about any other fruit or vegetable  
It‚Äôs only apples, though I can be reminded of the apples sound when preparing them sometimes.  
that's kinda weird my dude, maybe you should see someone about it, I'm not telling you to but from what I see in your comments it seems like the best way to go.  
Oh my god your gonna be a doctor guaranteed  
So am i  
How is it & how did you get insomnia?  
Id like you to clear up that first question since to me its a little fuzzy. But for the second question, i have a narcissistic mother. She causes me a lot of stress and anxiety, especially with everything that's going on right now. Stress, anxiety, and depression are leading causes for Insomnia. So i got Insomnia due to stress and anxiety from my mother.  
I meant, how do you get by the night?  
Oh! I usually just go on my phone. But because i am a teen, i cant do that all the time. Ill just stare at the ceiling or wall. I know it sounds bland, but thats because im a teen. But yeah, stare at something or my phone.  
wow, i feel sorry for you mate  
does it piss you off when people joke about having it? and how does it affect your daily life, if you don't mind me asking  
Although it doesn't piss me off, it annoys me just a little. Like dude, i literally didn't sleep in 3 days and you are here joking about not sleeping for some days when you clearing aren't feeling drowsy. It doesn't impact my life a lot as i thought it was, but it still hits kinda hard. My speech can be a bit slurred, i lose concentration  
Do you get used to not sleeping or not sleeping much?  
Im used to it, but it doesn't mean I like it.  
Oh ok and I didn't think you liked it lol  
Are you diagnosed?  
do you feel tired and just cant sleep? or do you feel normal and just cant really sleep even though you try? Sorry if these are stupid i dont know a lot about insomnia  
In my case, I can't sleep and I feel tired.  
Don't you feel sleepy in school during lectures..?? you if can't sleep at night then you have a good reason to play pubg too..  
Whats ur mbti type?  
I'm not entirely sure what you're referring to. Can you elaborate on the question?  
Sure I wanted to know whats ur mbti type bc i was curious. Mbti is a personality system and there are some online tests to figure your type out but the 16 personalities test is bad and the most inaccurate. Mbti is based on cognitive functions who are scientifically proven. So it makes a lot of sense. Most tests are based on cognitive functions for example idrlabs and 2key. My type for example is an infp. An mbti type is based on 4 letters and there are 8 to describe them. Those 8 are E/i S/N F/T P/J. I could go on with this but it takes a lot of time. If you want to just take the test or do your own research.  
I didn't know about it, i will definitely do it and get back to you with the results.  
Thank you :D  
I have the same diagnosis as OP and I bounce between INTP and INFP.  
Do you have relationships and close friendships with people or do you find it difficult?  
I am a social butterfly, kind of too much of one. I am a very friendly person, i could talk all day if anyone lets me. I'm kinda weird though, i act younger than i am. And i am very immature sometimes. XD  
What is it like?  
Sometimes i have trouble connecting with people and i just end up talking and talking without realizing that they're not interested...  
[deleted]  
Sometimes i have trouble knowing if someone is actually angry, or if they're just kidding with me. In a group setting I'm usually quiet because i always try to talk when there's a slight pause and i don't know when it's acceptable for me to start talking... Sometimes i think someone is kidding angry when they are actually angry and i try to joke with them and they get even more angry XD.  
Oh my god... I‚Äôm in the process of getting tested for autism and adhd and I think you describe a daily struggle of mine perfectly! Mind if I mention it to my psychologist? ü§Ø  
Sure! Go right ahead! I'm happy to help!  
You know there's a book on wattapd called, "Quirky Tales Of April Hale". The things you said was exactly the same the girl faced. At first I was kind of confused as it didn't same you know abnormal. Because some people are naive and don't know much about interaction and all. But you seem very optimistic about it. Like you know you are different in a way that doesn't bother me but you have accepted it as a part of you. I hope you keep your optimism up. Hope you always stay happy.  
want to be homies?  
you like anime?  
me too i also have highly functioning autism and adhd lol what a coincidence.  
I watched atla religiously as a kid... Still do  
heck yee!!  
Will you ignore your family entirely once you become independent or will you try to forgive them? Interested in Your answer.  
I'm planning on cutting ties with my parents, especially my father. I'm not sure about my mother yet. I will keep contact with my siblings, as they have been treated miserably as well. My sister may downgrade me, but I believe it's only because our father has been insanely strict and completely destroyed her self confidence. She cries a lot, and can get very sensitive. We talked about it for a long time, and she did say she's sorry, and that sometimes she can't control it. As for my brother, he's also a victim. He never deserved to be manipulated into this, and I fully blame my father for everything.  
Ever called a Hotline to protect you from this abusive crap.  
I only ever called one of these hotlines where you just talk about your problems and they listen, give you an advice or two and keep everything you say to themselves. I can never bring it over myself to call child-protective-services or such.  
Do you want to be emancipated...  
No. I can't leave my siblings alone.  
Have you considered taking them with you?  
I did, very often, but they told me to not do it. It's difficult to explain, but we don't want to leave at this point of time. Leaving family behind is so difficult, I can't imagine how I'll manage it when I'm grown. After all, they're blood.  
But if you‚Äôre being abused, there are people that can help. It can be difficult standing up against family, but when they do that to you, you have no choice. As a physiologically abused teen, I had to stand up against my parents and tell them to stop. They didn‚Äôt understand me and my paranoia. But I had to stop letting them do that to me. My parents are nice to me now that they understand. But you, you need to get out of there. Some people don‚Äôt care about their child‚Äôs mental wellbeing.  
Are you the only one abused and what would have to happen for you to finally call child protective services?  
No, my entire family has fallen victim to it. I still remember hearing my father hit my mother when they got into a really bad argument. I still remember watching my sister break into tears after my mother threatened to tell dad how useless she was. I remember my brother getting yelled at without an end after getting a bad grade. All of this has been so..normalized in our family. My sister told me she'd never call the police, even though she knows that what's happening is not okay. I don't think I will ever manage to call CPS. We still have nice moments together, and I can't even imagine breaking that part. Even though our family is mostly broken already, I still hope that it will turn into something better.  
Go to the cops and tell them you don‚Äôt wanna go back. Just get out.  
I can't. I really can't. I made a promise to my siblings. They begged me to not do anything. I can't just leave like that; Everything I know would just end up in a huge mess, and I'll be forced into something worse than I ever went through. Really, everything is pushing me to go, but everything is holding me back.  
No!!! Call the damn cops to save you and your siblings so you guys wont suffer from this home abuse. If you keep holding yourself back then things will just get worst but if you do what needs to be done then you might end up in child protective service. CALL THE DAMN COPS!!!! TO SAVE YOU AND YOUR SIBLINGS!!!!  
Hey. You're better then all of this. You just need to be strong for a little while longer, and then you can get the hell out of Dodge. This isn't a question, it's just support, or at least it's trying to be. I grew up with an abusive father who beat me and my mom, and is a convicted child rapist. If I can move on, you can too. It will get better. Maybe not today, maybe not in years, but it will get better.  
Thank you for the kind words, I will try my best to keep it up! And you're very brave for being able to move on.  Good luck in the future!  
Appreciate it. Keep on going sister.  
It's terrible what you and your siblings are going through. At what point do you think you can become independent and leave your household?  
I'm generally just trying to save as much money as I can, so I believe once I'm around 18-20 I will be able to leave the household and live on my own and go to university. It's my dream to become a Prosecutor!  
I'm sure you can make your dream a reality. And I think that sounds great, the sooner you can get out of that house the better. And with a good job you can help your siblings too. I hope things get better for you soon.  
Are they abusive to the point where they refuse to feed you at times?  
Have you ever tried threatening your father with police or CPS when he physically abuses you? Also have you ever sat down with him and explained to him that what he‚Äôs doing is wrong and is tearing up the family and hurting you?  
Oh, I did that a lot. When I tell him that I can just call the police, he gets aggressive and threatens me even more. I talked with him about the whole thing SO often, but he never admits to it. To him, our family is completely normal.  
Do you have any evidence on what really went down? Or did you throw it all away? And how is this affecting your life currently?  
I'm having to go to court and prove I'm not malicious, most of the paperwork is from my lawyers office. He tells me they are just trying to beat statues of limitations and I've nothing to worry about. But I have things to lose and a past I don't want brought into the light so all in all it's one big stress ball.  
I can see that well I hope it gets better and you dont have to go through anymore stress cause of this  
What was the tattoo?  
One is of three cocopellis on my ankle all in black. It's pretty cute but totally not my style anymore. The other was a sort of tribally ring on my upper arm that I let my friend do for me when she was practicing to get a license. That seemed like a nice idea 20 years ago.  
My sister married a tattoo artist.  As a practice canvas, she has a few that I am pretty sure she is going to need removed in 20 years.  :)    
Start putting money into a removal fund as an anniversary gift!  
haha, good idea!   
Also, which hurt worse?  The removal or the tattoo?   
I got the tattoos so long ago it's hard to remember the sensation. I would say the removal hurts more but is much quicker, although less exhilarating.   
I had my first treatment two days ago. I've been thinking about having my 20-year-old, faded tattoo removed for a long time and finally jumped on it when TeamBuy offered a really good deal for the place I'd already decided to go.  It's really interesting...I wonder how long it will take for the "scavenger cells" to eat up and carry away the broken-down pigment. Right now I have a raised, welty-looking tattoo with kind of a rash all around it (like your picture).  FWIW I felt that getting it removed was far worse than getting it put on.   
I wonder how long this phase lasts too. It's itchy as all fucking hell after two weeks. The required eight weeks between treatments makes much more sense to me now. Good luck!  
Oh fuck. I'm already really itchy...don't tell me it gets worse!  I have this lotion stuff from LUSH that includes calamine (the pink stuff your mom put on you for itching) - hope that will calm me down. ;)  
[deleted]  
Yes, they're still totally visible! One treatment is just the beginning. It can take 5-15 treatments to remove the tattoos. Right now they just look kind of faded and there's some scabbing from the "pinhole bleeding" caused by the laser. I'll post before/after pics for my next treatment in mid-March if you're interested - they have to be eight weeks apart the first few times. Think about it A LOT before you get started. It's a long and expensive process and the results aren't guaranteed. I only took the leap after years of consideration.  
Do you have before and after pics?  
I don't have a good before, but here's what it looks like two weeks after my first treatment. Before the treatment the figures were perfectly black with clean edges. Now they're kind of blurry and faded. Black ink is supposed to be most responsive to laser treatment, but it seems like I'll need several more treatments to really make a difference. They're still healing - I think my winter dry skin is not helping and I'm putting lotion on that spot several times a day. I'll take before and after pics for my next treatment in mid-March.  
Also, the laser doesn't just hit once and that's the effect you get.  It will increase over time from that one session, as well.  
Do you mean the blurry/faded effect? Or the dry/scabby effect?  
The "tattoo is going away" effect.   The immediate result you see after a laser session is not the extent of the result you're going to see. The laser explodes the pigment and kills the skin cells. Over time your skin will push out the dead cells and you will actually see more of a result from that same one session.  That's why they say a longer duration between sessions is a good idea. Allows your skin to fully heal.   
How did you decide where to go? Just a dermatologist's office?  
I got a couple of recommendations from my doctor but they didn't have the latest equipment and wanted to do surgical removal which just seemed weird to me.  I did a lot of research and found that the Q-switch laser is cutting edge for tattoo removal (not that I know what Q-switch means).  Find a place that OWNS a Q-switch laser. Some places rent them temporarily, so they're not always available for treatments and the employees may not have as much experience with them.  
Very good to know, thanks!  
Wil taking viocadin ease the pain? I'm getting a removal next weak I...Uhh got mad at my wife nd uhhh umm got drunk and uhh got "my wife is a drunk whore" on my uhh...back..yeah... So vikes will they stop the pain?  
I didn't try it so I can't comment. Good luck with all that.  
Pics or it didn't happen.  
Lol removed completely :)  
It's an odd way to dress period, but to each their own.    
I'm all for self expression and all....but I'm not dressing like a hooker and I'm not pregnant. Plus, she's at a rave and heavy beats like that aren't good for little babies in a sack full of water.  
yeah why's she wearing that 16 year old girl mask?  
Is it possible its Halloween?  
Am going to here all day  
Do you get weird feelings about newborns or how your self was born since sex is needed for that to happen  
there is no I have two little nephews and they all both for once newborn so I'm comfortable with us  
Are you afraid it hurts or what aspects specifically are you afraid of?  
No I am afraid of going to hell you see grew up in purity church.you see they told me if I had sex out side marriage I will go stright to hell thy forch us to watch education video or a movie that talk about told us about std this was around12  
Am afraid of getting close  
I'm catholic so I always heard the "Sex before marriage is forbidden" talk. I don't have a fear of Sex but a fear of how it will change me once its done. I was never told that I would go to hell for it but that it was HIGHLY looked down upon and that "everyone would know" because they would see that it "physically" changed something about me. I'm still a virgin because of it so I more or less understand what you might be feeling. If I could, I would do it in a heartbeat if the feeling of guilt didn't linger. My family strongly implemented this ideology but as I got closer to my 20's my parents stopped trying to scare me out of it and became completely honest with me. My aunts and uncles still try to put this idea in my cousins and in me sometimes even though I'm an adult now.  
I grew up in the Purity culture where you at the takes take class but absence only classes there I scared the s*** out of you they show you what happens to you if you do it outside of their especially the Christian hell houses during the special Halloween class they'll take you in and they'll take you to the abortion part of the Hell House you are now given a test many paths you get these shiny purity ring. Right now I am the only one in my family who is a virgin  
Whoa. Yeah my church just shames you for it. There's no special hell for losing your virginity  
That's how it was Miss Whiskey this experience push me way form church that how I become a atheist  
Did u ever have a Gf or Bf? If so, did they understand it?  
? The answer is no never had a GF or BF.  
Since this is an older post - has anything changed for you? Have you started therapy or found other helpful resources?  
The answer is no it is a very weird form of therapy someone needs to be a therapist and a prostitute at the same time  
What do you feel about Pewdiepie? Or what does Swedish people think about him? How would you describe your country in a nutshell?  
I love PewDiePie, and I think most people my age think he‚Äôs really cool! I would describe sweden as grey, quiet and beautiful!  
Are you a hot blonde wearing a bikini?  
Hot brunette!  
Do you at least wear a bikini?  
Haha I would if it wasn‚Äôt cold  
Follow up question, do you enjoy meatballs.  
What is it like to live among the most prosperous and economically stable nations on the planet? Are you guys really that happy and comfortable?  
I would say that we have it really good here in Sweden, but it‚Äôs not perfect. I don‚Äôt really have anything to compare to, but I would say most Swedes are happy, and it‚Äôs really thanks to our social programs and that most public services are free :)  
Jag √§r ocks√• svensk lol  
Hur √§r din dag?  
Bra tack! Fast lite gr√•... :)  
What do you think of all the Swedish troops that has died on the battle field  
This is a difficult question, the military is not as (i guess) honorable here as it is in other countries. I think it‚Äôs brave of them to risk their lives for peace and I respect them for it  
you eat the fitta? :) btw do you watch Anomaly?  
Eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner! And no, I haven‚Äôt seen that  
nice, me too. He‚Äôs a Swedan Yt-er that moved to Malta and makes retardet/funny vids. You should check him out! He‚Äôs cool  
Sounds fun, I‚Äôll check him out!  
ok  
What do you think about living in sweden.  Jag tycker det √§r perfekt men kallt.  
I love it! √Ñlskar allt med det, utom att det √§r s√• m√∂rkt kanske :)  
Thanks for the AMA  
Is it really the rape capital of Europe ??  
I‚Äôve also heard that, but I still feel that it isn‚Äôt unsafe here. I don‚Äôt know anyone who is worried about being raped, maybe it‚Äôs just that people here are more open about being raped? I‚Äôm not sure  
Thanks for reply..  
Opinions on your neighbor land Norway? (I'm from Norway so I'm just curious)  
I think it‚Äôs a beautiful country, and we have a lot to learn from you!  
Y‚Äôall eat said Swedish fish a lot ?  
Hmmm Jag e inte svensk men....jag undrar vad du t√§nker om manniskor som jag som kommer fr√•n USA och kan tala p√• svenska. √Ñr vi fortfarande konstigt? Eller are vi lite annorlunda nu? Dumma fr√•ga men jag alltid undrade.... Bo tillbax i USA nu sedan 2008  
Ja, det √§r lite konstigt haha! Man h√∂r ganska tydligt att ni inte pratar rikssvenska, men det g√∂r ju inget. Annars f√∂rst√•r jag inte riktigt vad du fr√•gar?  
Du svarade perfekt min fr√•ga. Tack!  
how make food. please say. am starving. only food left is pc. not want eat pc.  
pc?  
personal computer. now teach  
eat the hard drive first  
which one is it  
what do u make per month?  
about 2,500 i‚Äôm in college  
Do you have an Instagram? Do art trades? Collabs?  
What type of art do you make?  
I don't now how to make hands please help me  
no artist does and if they do they made a deal with satan  
Hahaha  
Does knowledge of your disorder help you with relationships/interactions with others? How do you cope?  
Not yet, I guess it can be helpful but I don't really know how to interact properly with people, usually, I don't really care about relationships outside my family cycle, so is hard for me to make a friend or even a colleague. The diagnosis helped me in the way that I can understand why I behave the way I do, and it makes me pay attention when I'm acting like a selfish b*tch towards someone else.  
I‚Äôm not even sure what my answer to this question would be exactly, but what motivates you to treat other people well?  
Honestly, things are easier if I do so. If I treat people the way I want to it would be straight-up social suicide lol, sometimes is really hard but I do therapy to try to fix this.  
Ah, I see. Do you care about other people‚Äôs well-being at all or about certain people‚Äôs or not about anyone‚Äôs?  
I wouldn't say that I don't care about anyone, my type of caring is different. When it comes to my family I can say that they are important to me, I like them. But is very hard for me to connect with people that I don't know, therefore, I don't care about them, is not intentional I just can't feel anything.  
Ah, that makes sense. And yes, of course it‚Äôs not intentional!  
Are you on a treatment plan, and what does it comprise of?  
Yes, I am, it doesn't work tbh, I use it more to vent about my thoughts then anything else, my therapist tries to work mindfulness on me, think before I act, know what I'm feeling and why, that's very hard for me, my feelings are all fucked up and I never know exactly what I'm feeling and if it's right, I don't really worry that much about it, but when I try to pay attention to it is very confusing. But is hard for me to compromise with therapy, I always forget about it the moment I step out of the room, but I think is like that with almost everyone.  
Were you harass and physically abused? And ehy were you in a mental hospital?  
never abused in the hospital or outside of it.  everytime i was admitted it was for attempting suicide.  
Oh ok, don't try to kill yourself anymore people care about you both irl and online.  
ok  
What country do you live in?  
america  
Is it kinda like a "normal" stay at the hospital? I mean like that plus the supervision? What do you do all day? I've been in the psychward here in Sweden a couple of times in the past  
well, depends. 2 times i was a kid and 2 times i was considered an adult. the times when i was a kid was VERY different than my adult hospital stays.  what do i do all day? well, different hospitals have different rules some you do ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù some have a strict schedule.  and i‚Äôm curious as to what it‚Äôs like in sweden  
Maybe that inappropriate to ask (u dont need to answer) what are your diagnoses and how old are you? How long have you ben depressed?  
no i‚Äôm an open book!  i‚Äôve been diagnosed with bipolar II disorder  i‚Äôm now 19  i‚Äôm not depressed. bc i‚Äôm not sad all the time actually i‚Äôm quite a happy person. being bipolar is like a switch. when it gets triggered i‚Äôm like 180. boom. different person. those 180 turns in my personality can be happy or sad. (most the time they end up me being sad when i‚Äôm having an episode)  and this has been going on since i was 10  
Did u know from where you got the bipolar?  
unfortunately no, i‚Äôm adopted so i don‚Äôt know much about my birth parents except they were on drugs bad and that might have something to do with it i‚Äôm not 100% positive.  
I have some friends who've been in psych wards, but most don't say much about it. Only one of them seemed to have a positive experience, due to an extremely friendly and understanding nurse. What was your experience like with nurses/doctors/other inpatients?  
The nurses are always so nice!!!!!  doctors are nice too but u hardly see them.  most psychiatrists  for mental hospitals are basically fancy drug dealers and don‚Äôt care about your situation just wanna give you meds.  but the last one i had was VERY GOOD.  techs are really cool and nice.  my encounters with the other patients are um....different.  as a kid, things were bad most are there for attempting suicide. and they tend to ‚Äúlash out‚Äù ALOT  as an adult, very chill i mean you have your occasional crackhead which i love them  
Do you take lithium or any other meds?  
um i take Aripiprazole and Fluoxetine  
As an adult, how long was your stay?  We're you did you stay at the hospital you checked in to?  Thanks  
my stay was 9 days long and i don‚Äôt understand ur second question  
Sorry, horrible typo.  I meant did you stay at the hospital that you checked in to or were you transferred to another. I was told this sometimes happens.  
well because of my suicide attempts, i would first go to a medical hospital. then after i was physically ok i would be transferred to a mental hospital.  
Thanks for the reply.  
Do you ever fantasize about going back to the ward? Im just asking because Ive been to the psych ward a few times too and I sometimes fantasize going back  
when i was a kid i wanted to go back because it was a break from the things i had going on. but as an adult no . because then i can‚Äôt pay my bills.  
Yeah those places are insanely expensive..  
well my health insurance covered my expenses but i meant like phone bill, rent, utilities,car insurance  
Ohhhh, yeah those exitst.  
i don‚Äôt really understand how you get taken to a mental hospital, like do you go in an ambulance or did ur parents take u..?  also, what did you do all day?  
it depends you can check yourself in (having someone drive you) or cop car which mean most the time you came from a hospital and they have u on suicide watch so for me, they handcuffed me and drove me there.  my dads a cop so the first 2 times my father took me.  my last 2 times a different cop took me because i was an adult.  still handcuffed. i‚Äôve never volunteered to go check myself in because the more violent your suicide attempts are the health doctor makes u go.  and what i did all day:  i most the time i drew (with markers, there are no pens or pencils) because i am an artist.  most the time there is group therapy. these are referred to as ‚Äúgroups‚Äù i would get to know the other patients. and sleep.

I learned some basic Javascript in college, and did a bit of experimenting with C++.  Will probably start a game development training course within the next year, so that should help. When it comes to games, I want to make one like the games I played as a kid, so think of something like Mario, Sonic, and Mega Man all mixed together.  
I‚Äôm a female with Asperger‚Äôs.    Did gaming/game development start as a special interest for you?  
It definitely is a great coping mechanism, that's for sure.  I think I started wanting to make games ever since I got my DS.  So, I guess so.  
Wtf I'm a 16 year old girl with aspergers hoping to get into character design for games, future work partner??  
Maybe someday!  
What do you find stimulating?  
What are your kinks ?  
Oral and cum.  
Was your pregnancy accidental or on purpose?  
On purpose by my husband.  
What do you like most about being pregnant?  
Are you a falling down stairs, or falling upstairs type of person.  
Where you from?  
Michigan  
Mild or spicy?  
Spicy  
An AMA with no limits, hosted by a chick, and only a couple questions. Huh.  Size of your tits? Best day of the quarantine? Posts on any GW sub? Chicken size Trex or Trex size chicken as the next main in Jurrasic World 3 or 4 or whatever it is?   
That would be scary. Does it happen every time you sleep? Or just sometimes? What does it sound similar to?  
It just happens sometimes. Maybe a few times every month. I hear alot of people saying it's just as bad as sleep paralysis but most nights I get anxiety wondering if tonight's gonna be the night it happens.  
That sucks. But at least it doesn‚Äôt happen every night  
I recently read an interesting supernatural Creepypasta regarding this syndrome and it‚Äôs quite interesting lol. Do you take any medication for it?  
No i don't it's like sleep paralysis there's no cure I'm aware of yet. May I ask what the creepypasta mentioned regarding EHS?  
I found a recording of it on youtube. https://youtu.be/jralHXEl-vE that‚Äôs the link if you want to watch/listen to it. It includes quite a bit of alternate reality/mysterious entity(?) kinda stuff and it‚Äôs kinda like semirealistic horror/thriller lol. The story is ok but the idea is pretty interesting.  
Do they know what causes this? Is there treatment?  
Nah not really the most they know is it's caused by stress and no unfortunately there is no treatment that I'm aware of I can get. Also apparently people with exploding head syndrome are more likely to get sleep paralysis as well.  
I literally had this happen to me again for the first time in months the other night. I usually hear an unbearable ringing noise, I've also heard voices and seen apparitions once. I've read that exploding head syndrome can be caused by stress, and can sometimes cause anxiety.  
wow I've heard rumors of like ringing noises and apparitions but voices? I never knew you could hear voices from it. Glad to know I'm not the only one tho  
Are you 100% positive she isn‚Äôt actually your mother? It happens a lot.  
Yes, I'm sure. A little background information, both my parents had been married previously, and had kids with their previous spouses. My oldest sister is from my dad's previous marriage, and she absolutely hated my mom. If this were the case, I would've no doubt have been raised by a witch named Martha, who I've heard absolutely nothing positive said about her with exception of when sister in question talks about her. Edit: adding on. There's also a ridiculous number of pictures in the hospital with me any my mom, as well as the story brought up time to time where my dad nearly decked the doctor, because apparently the doctor we had was an absolute dick.  
Is that a cool thing!!!!!  
Thanks :) Gives some of my peers a handful of confusion when they hear my dad as old as some of their grandparents lol  
How do you have sex/get off?  
I've never had sex with an animal if that's what you're asking. I'm also attracted to humans and I'm in a happy relationship (my girlfriend is not a Zoophile but she respects my identity). So I'm sexually satisfied. But. Occasionally, I will masturbate to animal videos/images (mostly dogs, wolves, and other canine-like animals). Id never have sex with my own pet. That feels like incest/grooming to me and I'm not comfortable with it.  
How did you discover your attraction?  
Ive always loved dogs on general. I can across another zoos fantasy blog and read a few posts and things just clicked. I started looking into it more and more. I was probably around 17 at the time  
Was it hard to accept yourself?  
Yes. Most people don't understand it and are against it. It's hard for me to be open about it in my real life. I've lost friends and relationships before. The person I'm dating right now is accepting of it. It makes things easier.  
Have you ever fallen in love with a dog?  
Sorry to break it to you, but you¬¥re not a zoophile. You are not active with an animal and you don¬¥t seem to have any intent to change that; also your whole "zoophilia" solely consists of "watching animal movies/pictures"...that alone doesn¬¥t turn you into a zoo. I really wonder what you are able to offer here, in an AMA about something you don¬¥t take part in, you hardly know more than "watching animal movies/pix" while masturbating, yet you propagate yourselves as "we"...as if you, a non experienced person obviously living a rather normal life, had anything significant to bring into the debate. You know what¬¥s worse than no information? False information. From people who self "identify" as X or Y, but have no actual connection to what they claim to be. Sorry for the harsh words, but I don¬¥t see you being able to give out any relevant info at all.  
I haven't had sex with an animal, but I know for a fact I'm attracted to them. I don't need to have sex with humans to know I'm attracted to them. Zoo porn is highly illegal and risky so I try not to get involved with that too much. Internet activity is easier to track than what happens in my personal home. Although your response was well thought out and critical, I think you're basing attraction solely off of sexual experiences and that's not how attraction works.  
You seem to conflate attraction with an established sexual orientation. The fact that you feel attracted to animal pictures/videos is just one box you tick here...with several others unticked.  I simply don¬¥t buy all this bullcrap like "I feel like X, so I AM X".  It¬¥s not your thoughts (not even masturbatory ones) that define you, but your actions. What would you say if I tell you that many rather normal humans get aroused by animal mating films? Not a single one of them self identifies as a zoophile, though. How does that fact fit into your narrative?  Regarding animal porn: idk where you live, but in the vast majority of countries in the world, animal porn is illegal to produce and distribute, but not to consume. So whats your point here? Not that I would stick your claim of being a zoo solely on usage of animal porn, in fact I¬¥m rather critical of it myselves as there¬¥s nothing more worse out there, nothing that negatively influenced the public perception of zoos as much as animal porn.  Attraction =/= orientation. And you still haven¬¥t answered my question what exactly you¬¥re able to offer, what insights into the life of a practicing zoophile you can provide as someone whose only connection to zoophilia is watching animals while masturbating. What is leading you to doing this AMA when you have literally nothing to offer and are most likely to screw it up for those more "involved" in zoophilia with unthoughtful answers, uninformed clamis and no experience to talk from? Do you really think that an attraction that could easily be placed inside the kink/phantasy section of human sexuality actually even slightly resembles the struggles of people who are in constant battle with society due to their practiced sexuality? Who cannot "fall back" onto human relationships because they¬¥re exclusive zoophiles? I simply cannot wrap my head around your intentions here. And I cannot understand why you¬¥re talking about "we" either...who are those other people you¬¥re talking about?  I cannot stop you from doing this, but maybe I can change your mind about the necessity of doing stuff like this AMA. You will inevitably destroy more than you will build up when you pose as someone you factually aren¬¥t. When you are confronted with more in depth questions about the ethics and morality of zoophilia, what will you answer? The usual text splinters you picked up from "zoo" online forums? Your attraction doesn¬¥t seem to have a bigger impact on your life besides from the occasional wank. How does that compare to the life of an actual zoophile and his/her everyday friction with society? I can only say that you should rather be glad your "zoophilia" isn¬¥t zoophilia and you avoid a shitload of problems. Be thankful that your life isn¬¥t half as complicated as that of a zoophile whose sexuality isn¬¥t "pacified" by jerking off to animal images. Be glad...and don¬¥t feel entitled to speak for a group you lack any deeper understanding of.  
I think you don‚Äôt understand what zoophile means. It‚Äôs just attraction (Phile) towards animals (zoo) Duh üòÇ  
It¬¥s rather that you don¬¥t know the difference between an attraction and a sexual orientation. Or are the thousands of fantasy roleplaying posts in reddit all zoophiles although they too are "attracted" towards animals? In the sense you use the z-word, it¬¥s hardly more than a kink.  You also don¬¥t know what impulse OP¬¥s  "zoophilia" is originating from, the taboo, just phantasising as a means for escapism and to experience the "not normal"...or really the basic meaning of the word zoophile, from its Greek roots to zoon = animal and ho philos = friend. It¬¥s not my fault that you little simpletons seemingly are all craving for an easy classification, but not everyone who has any sexual interest in an animal is a zoophile.  
What is your favorite animation movie?  
Who framed roger rabbit! Thats What got me really interested in animation.  
Aw that‚Äôs a great reason  
Why is the pain and  sorrow  the Great War to end all war still hearts to me  
because it does.

Honestly I‚Äôve been close to bursting with rage :/ but over all life is pretty okay school just sucks  
[deleted]  
I hope so, I‚Äôve been thinking about doing pottery :) I remember doing it once and enjoying it  
who r u?  
A regular teenage girl. Nothing special about me.  
Why did my dad leave?  
Because he couldn‚Äôt handle your greatness. Or I dunno he‚Äôs just an ass wipe. Or this is joke either way I dunno  
How do you balance your time between school work and personal art work & leisure time?  
I have a study hall which I try to get my all my work done in. Lately I haven‚Äôt been really motivated to draw, which annoys me but haven‚Äôt found a good push for me to get back in it. And I‚Äôll stay up late for more me time, like watching YouTube or just scrolling through Instagram.  
insert but why gif here  
what is it that you find so fascinating/attractive about it?  
It‚Äôs usually just sexual pleasure that you get from seeing it. It is extremely weird.  
Inflated things? Or inflating things?  
It depends on the type you like, I perfer seeing a person inflate rather than just seeing an inflated person  
How did you find this out?  
How did I find what out? The fetish?  
Yes  
Well, you get it from either seeing it in media such as tv or movies, or you can get it from online culture, such as deviantart or furaffinity  
Oh. One last question; How much porn is there for this lol?  
So you like the whole person getting inflated or just a single body part? is there a part of the body you like seeing inflated the most?  
I honestly perfer ass inflation to any other type, however I do like stomach inflation and full body inflation.  
Do you watch plastic surgery‚Äôs?!  
Sometimes, why?  
My boyfriend always asks me why I stay up late after a long workday and I always tell him that I‚Äôm not ready to let this day end and start the next day without having some free time to myself. I need it to keep my sanity.   
I started doing the opposite. I go to bed early because I really love my sleep but then I wake up crazy early and relax, watch my shows, browse Reddit, eat breakfast in bed, etc. My free time is in the morning.  
I've tried that, but going to work baked impacts my performance.  
This comment takes the cake üòÇ  
I dont think he‚Äôs baking cakes  
You can‚Äôt bake your cake and take it too!!  
Dude I worked this holiday from home and was hanging out with friends smoking weed the whole day. It was the best Christmas ever. I had never smoked so much in one day.  
Upvoted to 420!   
I tried that too, but I get really anxious and cannot relax if I know I have to be someplace, or do something later in the day, anyone else?  
Yes, it pops up regularly on /r/DoesAnybodyElse  
Same. The night feels more in control, no anxiety. Morning I just start getting anxious.  
yup! it only works if I have the day off that day and know I can take a nap whenever I want.  If I work I'll be fine until an hour before I have to go to work and then I'll get super tired and be mad at myself for getting up early.  
I've tried it too and having the thought that I have to go somewhere later in the day completely robs me of any comfort and enjoyment.  
I get up really early too, plenty of time to relax before the day plus I get all kinds of stuff done. I'm on call 24/7, and it's the only time I'm pretty sure no one is going to bother me. Used to keep really late hours; I've just swapped the part of the night that I'm awake.  
I hate having things to do later in the day. If I have to go to work it makes me feel sad.  
I will try to start doing this. Thank you, u/TamedWildfire  
Amen  
Same here! I need some me time to chill out.  
So true! And living with someone who is turning MY OWN TIME into OURS is sometimes so sad!  
Every night. I like to get stoned to the bone at night and then I don‚Äôt want the fun to end. I usually play fortnite until like 1 am then maybe some Spider-Man then I‚Äôll lay in bed on Twitter until like 3. I need help.   
Yeah we have the same schedule. Not too good.   
Work out or do something else that exhausts your brain out so you actually can no longer be a functional human being at 3 am and HAVE to sleep.   
I decided I‚Äôm gonna have to 180 on em and start getting up at 530 to work out, work, then come home and probably already be a dead person and that should cut back on my weed induced video game binge. Yes. Thank you for the encouraging words.   
I‚Äôm working on doing this too, maybe we should start a club for people like us.   
Same, we can do this !  
I do this, and it is almost impossible to break. You just have to set yourself a end time for screens. I.e no screens after 11 pm. Then you will actually observe how tired and stoned you are, and bed is welcoming. The trick is not looking at your phone in bed, though. I actually just use a radio and just chill out and fall asleep to the radio (which has a turn off timer). After a few nights you actually look forward to actual alone time at night, rather than just filling up your consciousness with distractions.   
Same! And around  1 or 2 o clock I think I must go to sleep.. but first let me finish this game. And, Ah one more I will be fine tomorrow. Then when my alarm goes off 7 in the morning I feel like shit, tell my self to go to bed early, but I never do and it‚Äôs just a ongoing battle with myself each night and morning.   
stop targeting me :(  
Wanna be friends?   
The only help I can give you is to uninstall fortnite. Then you'll be alright.   
This is me every single night for the past 3 years. My kid is 3 and nights are my only truly free time. It‚Äôs when I watch Netflix and browse the web. Some nights it‚Äôs hard to decide what‚Äôs more fun... that or sleep    
I used to run into this problem too. Try getting rid of the kid!  
Every night  
Doing it right now, 4 more hours until the alarm goes off...... Yet here l am  
Yea same dude... ugh. There‚Äôs not enough time in a day I tells you!  
I hope you slept well.  
Have a great day!  
Me  
Every single night. I need my own time for myself or else I'm a miserable ass.   
Yeah it‚Äôs not even that I have stuff to do, I literally NEED that time by myself or I will undoubtedly go insane.   
Oh god me too. If I don‚Äôt get at least an hour of alone time a day I literally shut down. I hate functioning like a battery ughhhh   
I do my best to embrace it. Many who have ego problems or some sort of personal issue HAVE to be around people at all times, so I feel like wanting to be alone means that you are rather comfortable with who you are. That‚Äôs just my thoughts. Interested to know why some people are like this   
Wow that‚Äôs a really insightful way of looking at it. I love to be alone because there‚Äôs less social pressure and you can just really be yourself. I mean I‚Äôm myself around people too, there just something really freeing about being able to scream in an empty house and not have people give you dirty looks lol.  
I think I'm addicted to free time. To the point where I don't want to have kids. And I want a low maintenance relationship.   
Same though. I took a job working 12 hour days just so I can have an extra day off every week. Not so I can go do anything or hang out with friends. I just want to play video games and chill with my bf and dog.  
How do you handle 12 x4 week ? I work a normal 8 hour shift and I'm wreaked by the end   
Try two 16s then an 8 then a 24 in ot in the mental health field lol.  
It's usually just 12 √ó3 unless I take overtime, and I am always wrecked but then I sleep like a baby  
Definitely. I have 2 young kids and one big man child. Somebody wants something every minute of the day so finally at the end of the night when I'm in bed and suppose to be sleeping, I'm spending time watching a show or browsing Reddit when I really need sleep.  
This is exactly me except with 3 kids. We are on school holidays at the moment so the endless ‚Äòmummummummummummum‚Äô thing seems to be ten times worse at the moment. It sucks though because the next day I‚Äôm tired AF which makes everything so much harder. üò©  
I wonder if your spouse refers to you as a big woman child . Hmmm   
No. He calls her 'Mommy'.  
I doubt it, considering she's the adult in the relationship.  
You don't really know that EDIT: I'm sorry, this was a really stupid and pointless comment. But I don't want to delete it because you'll see a message notification and not be able to see what it was. Have a good one.  
It was a totally true and fair comment   
And you know this relationship personally ? My original point is if the genders were reversed and someone was randomly calling their spouse a child it would be jumped on instantly . Especially in a comment that has no need to mention it.  But because ‚Äúman child‚Äù is an accepted term it seems to go unnoticed .  A bit of equality would be nice .   
You have a point on the equality thing.  I think your opinion is just not popular. Sorry, man  
My wife scolded me for coming to bed super late last night. I had to remind her I have to sacrifice job, free time, for sleep. Can‚Äôt sacrifice job and I want more free time so sleep is sacrificed.  
Yes I will actually go to sleep earlier before days off because I know I will have some free time then.   
Same! I work Mon-Fri and Friday night I go to bed earlier than any other night. And it's always glorious.  
I do the same. My wife doesn't get it.  
Oh yeah. Isn‚Äôt it sad that people stay up all night, go to work running on empty, and then do it all over again every single day just to feel like they have any time at all to themselves? This is what scares me about having kids. I have very little free time as it is and I already feel run down just from working full time and keeping the house up. Add a kid to the mix and these eye bags are a permanent feature.   
Solution: don't have kids! The world already has more than it needs :)   
You don‚Äôt have to have kids.  My solution was to have kids at an older age (36) so I can hire someone to clean my house and even to watch my children so I can sleep in.  But yes there is a child tax on your life. However your priorities are much clearer and shift around.  So instead of staying up till 2AM my big rebellion is...what time is it...about 11PM.  You also learn to delay gratification.  Maybe we can‚Äôt eat at a fancy restaurant on a whim, but we can on Saturday.   And you get joy and fulfillment elsewhere.  I wouldn‚Äôt take back my kids for anything.    
It will be really really bad with kids. Just prepare yourself for that before you get into it. Being surprised by it, or convincing yourself it won‚Äôt happen is a lot worse. Be prepared.  
OOf me. My psych evaluation went something like ‚Äã Psychiatrist: So why do you never sleep? ‚Äã Me: Well, at least at night, I don't have to deal with any of these bitches. You catch my drift?  
I find this way too relateable.  I find myself tired, and have no issues falling asleep once I lay down and close my eyes. However my motivation to hop into bed and stop enjoying whatever I'm doing is always low, and most of the time I'll stay up as late as I can, taking the trade off for less sleep.  I tried to find some reading on changing my mindset on sleep, and have listened to podcasts about it, however I still find myself going to bed as late as I know I can get away with.  
Yes! I actually don‚Äôt understand the people that come home from work and go to sleep early. It just makes the next day of work come quicker!  
Story of my life. Been doing this basically since I graduated high school, so like, 7 years ago. Will probably die of heart failure at some point due to lack of sleep lol.  
Is there anyone who has a LPT or advice on how to change this? I'm running on fumes permanently because of this and shit needs to change. A valuable tip or advice please. Not "just go to bed earlier".  
I don't know how viable this is for you stranger, but can you cut back on your work? I went part-time a couple of years ago and having my life not revolve around work has done wonders for my mental health. Totally been worth not having much money for.  
Not viable unfortunately. I'm the sole provider for my family; wife and two young kids. My wife and I are discussing her going back to work after 5 yrs of being a full time mom. So maybe in the not so distant future I can cut back. But than I will have to watch our youngest kid during the day, so I'm not really gaining free time.   
If using your phone to avoid sleep is an issue, try this: If you justify having your phone in bed with you because you use it as your alarm clock, buy a stand-alone alarm clock, and at night turn off your phone and place it in another room.   
What do you think i'm doing right now?  
I feel this on a spiritual level  
YES MY WIFE HATES IT!! I get at least 5 hours of sleep on days I work.  I get up at 830 and go to bed at 3 or 330.  I just can't bring myself to go to bed at an earlier time even though I'm just playing video games or watching youtube/browsing reddit.  But usually when my wife is awake I'm hanging out with her, so when she goes to bed at 1130 that is my free time, which I want more than an hour or two of.  
This is us.  If you can manage it, I recommend separate bedrooms.  Wife and I have been sleeping apart most nights for pushing twenty years now.  
Yup, wife and I have been sleeping apart as well, though it started because I sleep funny and always elbow her back or kick while I sleep. Once we get a bigger bed and one of those mattress‚Äô that barely moves when another person moves around we will try sleeping in the same room again  
I'm currently studying to be an engineer and I have the most packed days I ever had, so I often end up working until around midnight, but I always sacrify at least an hour of sleep to the internet when I shouldn't. ‚Äã I would really like to be freed of this burden but I don't seem to have the strength to do so.  
Avid sleep procrastinator here!  
Seems to be 98% of adult life. Especially if you have kids   
Every weekday I stay up to 2:00 - 2:30 even though I have work the next day. I'm 27 and I am doing it until I die in a year or two from exhaustion.  
I do it every day and regret it every morning.  
Every fucking night. I work from home and have 3 kids so "free time" is not plentiful. I wake up and parent then I "go" to work, i take lunch and hang out with the kids, then I get off work and relieve my partner and hang out with the kids.  Then its dinner and after the kids finally get to bed I just want some time to myself  
Absolutely. As a someone who has an almost unbelievably happy home family life, I adore spending time with my wife and daughter. That being said, I relish the times they go to bed and I can play FIFA and Rocket League undisturbed   
Yup. It's much worse when you use large amounts of methylphenidate   
Yes. At this exact moment  
As someone who likes to stay up late exactly for this reason, I also like to wake up early for the same.   
DAE breathe?  
OMG! Me too!  
All the time, i have weird work schedules which consists in me going to work at 3pm and leaving at 12am, so i really dont enjoy the day and at night everything is closed for me to do anything, so i just lay in bed with my pc till morning.  
Too often!!! I only  started doing this recently   
I get home from work late and can never bring myself to go to bed right away, even if it means not sleeping and regretting it the next day  
My life rn  
Omg yes! Story of my mf life. I love it though   
All the time. If I don't get my me time I'll stay up later to get it.  
I like to stay up because I don‚Äôt want my time with others to end. If I‚Äôm alone, I‚Äôll fall asleep right quick.   
Its more like I stay up late to GET my free time. I work early, come home late.   
Me!! üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  
As a mother I can tell you this is what I am doing this very moment   
Every day!!  
Doing that right now.  
Yes.  
Every damn night. Ugh.  
Exactly me now. I worked 14 hours total at my two jobs. I'm exhausted, my feet hurt, and I still need to do laundry. I just want a drink and play some Dota but honestly I'm probably gonna crash out cause I'm just over the day   
I felt this.   
It‚Äôs the only thing that keeps a pistol out of my mouth sometimes.   
All the time. Then regret it as I struggle to wake up in time for school.  
My thought 2 seconds ago.   
That's what I'm doing right now.  
Doing so right now, in fact.    
Literally me right now! üòÇ  
Currently doing this  
Haha it‚Äôs 3:07 in the morning here. I spent all night playing smash bros ultimate with my cousins, so I feel that. Now I‚Äôm on Reddit because I don‚Äôt want to go to bed.  
Sleep is my free time.  
Yes.  
This is me right now  
I do this almost every night.   
yes! after work I need at least 2-3 hours even if its already really late to just enjoy myself. I feel like a day is wasted if I didn't get much free time.  
As a parent......I try but I fall asleep anyway.   
This was me last night. I went to bed at 1am. Why? No reason really, I just kinda wanted to.  
I've flipped this and have started to wake up early. Feeling personally fulfilled before work has made my life better overall. I feel less stressed and more relaxed after and before work now. Try it out!   
Yep  
Yep - plus drinking time  
I always stay up late because I'm trying to collect more junk so I can make more shit in Fallout 76 or because I'm binge watching The Office again for the 70th time. So yeah, I  guess so.  
Almost always. Then I'm in a chronic brain fog because I'm so tired   
Yep  
I get off work at midnight, I need at least 2 hours to do some activities before bed or else my mind can‚Äôt turn off.   
Literally doing it right now even though both myself and boyfriend are tired.   
Me right now.  
YESSS!!! HAHAHA DAMN IT YES  
Kind of...I get sleepy and if I continue to do whatever I was before, then I eventually get some energy. Ping pong until I pass out haha  
yes, I got shit to do tomorrow morning so I don't want it to come  
Almost every night.  Also not wanting to face tomorrow.  
This exact thought ran through my head not 20 minutes ago.  
All the time. -,-  
Nearly every single night. I convince myself that I can go on 4 hours of sleep. Every morning I regret that choice. But still somehow worth it.  
Please define "free time".  
Doing that right now  
I‚Äôm doing this right now  
Every night.   
Every day  
Oh, hell ya!  
This is happening too much for me rn, waking up at 5:00 in the afternoon  
Am doing that now  
Story of my life and it‚Äôs really harming me. See my most recent post. I feel so powerless to stop it though   
You mean like right now? Yes.  
All the time  
I avoid bed because tomorrow is the next day.  
I‚Äôve been at work miserable because I only slept 2 hours. But then I end up staying up way past when I should go to bed that night. I‚Äôll sleep when I die!   
Why I‚Äôm perpetually exhausted.   
Me right now....  
Almost every night. Doing it as we speak.  Some people meditate, some sleep, I game. Is my way to detach from the working day.  
I spend all day wanting to just go home and go to bed, then the time comes and I dont want the mindless social media scrolling or binge watching to end! I always pay for it the next and yet I do it all over again!   
I am doing that right now.  
Everyday!  
Yes. My husband and I work at the same company and carpool together. My late nights are the only alone time I get.  
My life in a post.   
When I was bullied in school I wouldn‚Äôt want to go to sleep because then school would come sooner so I would stay up until I feel asleep from exhaustion  
Reading this question made me realize that the exact reason why I stay up late is because I want more free time. I didn't realize it until now, though, kinda funny.  
Sadly yes also this is exactly why I hate this modern world for this exact reason everyone‚Äôs miserable and nobody does what they want truly  
One word. Terraria r/terraria where are you guys  
Worked 6-2pm shift used to go to bed at 1/2am Worked nightshift 10pm - 6am went to bed at 2pm  Safe to say I hate the whole.  Work eat sleep repeat   
So happy I‚Äôm not alone in this!  
Yes!  
Yes and I hate myself for it all day long, until the work day ends and it starts over again. I think workdays should be shorter...  
Aaaand this is the universe telling me to take my ass to sleep.  
I was just about to post this. Only had 3.5hours of sleep and now I have work. Faaaaaaaaaaakkkk!!!  
I get up early for it  
Yep, every single night of my life   
I once had a therapist that told me that it is a sign of depression. I am not saying you have it, just that it is a sign of it. She told me I had reached a point in my life where I didn't want tomorrow to come, that was why I stayed up so late.  
Yes I‚Äôm doing this at the moment lol. It‚Äôs 2 i. The morning and j gotta work tomorrow. Wah :(   
If I go to sleep early, I have to go to work earlier. If I stay up, I have more time to do nothing.  Life hack  
Lol @ all the idiots with kids, shot yourself in the foot with that one  
I think it's been even worse for me lately since I only get like 1 day off a week on average now. Then my day off is usually spent cleaning or running errands or something. So I rarely ever get time in general for any of my interests. (I have no children, couldn't imagine being able to do it with kids but I can't afford that anyway.) I also can't do naps and falling asleep has never been easy for me anyway, I get random bouts of insomnia and it generally takes a couple of hours for me to get to sleep in the first place.   
Not wanting to sound like a deprecating weirdo however it‚Äôs the truth.I stay up all night because i believe there is nothing for me to wake up to. And the serene rush from my Brian trying to make me fall asleep I use to relax in a therapeutic manor. I doubt most people don‚Äôt do that.   
Yes, this.  
Sleep at work #PowerMove  
Every night!  
Didn‚Äôt know anyone else experienced this. I used to describe it as ‚ÄúI need time where I‚Äôm awake but not at work‚Äù when I had a couple shitty jobs I hated.  Now I have a job I actually like and don‚Äôt mind going to just now I‚Äôm so used to be awake I still stay up late.   
There is a name for this that I cannot remember. Like the Sunday creeps or something.  But yes, especially if you don‚Äôt enjoy your job. It‚Äôs the worst then.   
Yes, and I've been thinking of it a lot lately with the intention to research ways to combat this bad habit.  
I always watch like an hour of TV after every time I go out with friends. If I don't spend some time by myself, I'm not satisfied with the day.  
I mean I have insomnia so I‚Äôm up by default but I do work when I‚Äôm up knowing it will keep me up. (Which is a bad idea) so I guess technically I am enabling myself to stay up longer than before   
Basically my life in a nutshell. Plus I love being alone, so the more alone time I get the happier I am.   
Hey, I don't need your personal attacks.  
God yes  
Every work night. Weekends I tend to have earlier nights.  
Bruh...  
Yeah and then when they say they don‚Äôt like it you sort of start to have a different feeling about the song.   
Or a different feeling about the person.   
Or a different feeling about your own life.   
Or all of the above.  
Lol I'm such a douche, I'm like "they just don't get how amazing this song is." Like I know music is subjective but there are some songs i genuinely don't understand how people don't like.   
I don't think that's douchey, you're allowed to like what you like.   
Yhup  
Or you feel nothing different because you dont give a fuck about their opinion  
This is me half of the time and the other half is being extremely insecure.  
So on avg. you give half fuck  
Yeah it usually annoys the women that are into me who btw are always imaginary.  
I  accept it but when they scorn at you for liking that type of music..I abandon them. No one needs friends who disses you for liking a type of music.  
Half my buddies have listened to primarily rap since we were young and the other half primarily metal. All really good friends but we just like busting the other's balls about what they're listening to  
I dont mind a lil ball bustin..but when the guy crosses the line and rants out to everyone about how sucky the music is and this music should just be banned and stuff.. then shits hit the fan. I mean everyone is entitled to their own free thinking and stuff right ? You dont just stop the music being played and loudly exclaim about a guy's music taste !    
Yeah as long as nobody is taking the banter too seriously then it's fine I think.  
I‚Äôve never related to this more  
I don‚Äôt get that feeling. I can still enjoy and share my music, while respecting someone else‚Äôs musical opinion.  
It's a really weird experience. It's not like showing someone a joke, or a meme. It's not like sharing a news article or a Reddit thread. Those are all media that help us relate and connect with things around us. My music is me, for lack of a better description. The music I listen to is so intensely personal that it's almost an externalization of my own emotions. Sharing my music feels like sharing a piece of myself. Never do I feel more vulnerable than when I share my music. Because them not liking it feels like them not liking me.  
I always tell people I don‚Äôt share my music because it‚Äôs basically opening a window into your soul, and I don‚Äôt share my soul with many humans   
I know what you mean‚Äîfor me I think it's an experience of alienation in that you are showing someone something very meaningful and personal to you, and if they don't respond or "get it" then it can be disappointing and make you feel disconnected from them (especially if it's a good friend or significant other).  
Happy cake day!  
Yeah I like enjoying music by myself... some songs are just too deep that they make me uncomfortable sharing with other people  
I feel like with a good chunk of my songs, you have to listen to them multiple times to get the meaning, so it sounds like nonsense with one listen  
Your songs? Care to share your discography? This should be an AMA. We have a person with their own songs!  
I appreciate the mocking nature of the comment based on taking a figurative element as literal, funny  
I too appreciate the time he took to make a funny.  
Frank ocean especially.  I would never listen to moon river or white ferrari with other people   
Everyone likes Frank Ocean. you're fine e  
It‚Äôs not that, it‚Äôs that I don‚Äôt wanna cry in the car wit my friends   
All the time. Even though I‚Äôve been told I have good taste in music, I just get suddenly shy and self conscious haha.  
That haha is tragic  
You can imagine the nervous tone of it  
If you actually want to show it to others, give them a Spotify playlist/whatever and let them listen to it on their own time. They're unlikely to be able to absorb it while you're watching and (personally) I don't really come to like songs until I've heard them a few times, which is more likely to happen if I have them on Spotify. Also avoids your problem.  
Getting a friend to actually listen to my spotify playlist is a task in itself  
Step 1: have friends... üò≠  
Yep, you ask them and they'll be like "yeah, I'll listen" and then a week has passed and they haven't said anything about it and you were hoping they'd come back and tell you how amazing it is so you ask them again if they listened and they'll either say "oh, I forgot, but I totally will!" or "yeah, it was good!" and you don't know if they're lying or not.   
I like to burn mix tapes for my girlfriend on CDs. It's outdated enough that it's cute, but the vast majority of cars on the road have  CD player so the medium is is accessible in a way that maybe a traditional cassette tape isn't  
Is this a Spotify ad account?   
Agreed. A lot of my favorite music I listen to through a personal context that I couldn't even begin explaining to people.  
DAE play "air instruments" (drums, guitar) while listening to their music, but turn to stone when someone else is near?   
The opposite. I do this at my desk at work all the time. I'm known as the air-drumming guy  
I would like to have that title.  
Me too, except I do it with my feet and imagine I'm playing some sick blast beats. I do it automatically all the time, even when not playing drums.  
All the time - I have a song that I like, so I show it to a friend, and they have no reaction until the end and it‚Äôs super awkward, and yeah TL;DR, don‚Äôt show songs to other people  
Your comment wasn't TL, I just DR.    
Trance  
Robert Miles  
John Mayer  
When you forget that a melodic and uplifting track has a much grittier intro that might turn people off but you don't want to change the song because it'll look like you made a mistake...  
Right! Who's afraid of 138?

I was actually thinking about this recently myself! I am extremely self-conscious and quite low on the confidence scale, so whenever I share something, it‚Äôs always quite precious to me (despite how cheesy that may sound). A little recently, I have been really into Synthwave and 80s-style music because I love the sounds and nostalgia (even when not having lived in it) feelings I get from them. It just makes me feel great! When I shared it to a friend, he was like, ‚ÄúIs this what you really listen to?‚Äù I instantly deflected it and avoided the subject entirely. I don‚Äôt want to paint him badly as he may have been curious, but I was quite hurt by that unfortunately. I also am the type of person who usually does not reveal his hobbies or interests (e.g., music, etc.) until I know a person well enough. Always anxious about what people think! I am quite flexible in my music preferences as well, as I tend to really like certain stuff from all genres. Especially ‚Äúepic‚Äù music, classical, EDM, and pop. It really depends on mood at the moment. Heck, I even love to listen to anime openings and soundtracks too from them; as well as video games and movies because some are genuinely great!   
I used to be very similar to you. I think that‚Äôs just the overly sensitive side of us showing. You have to remember that people will never not like you just for your taste in music and nothing is wrong with you for having a different taste in music. Granted I‚Äôm not gonna show certain songs to people just because they might be so foreign to them they won‚Äôt enjoy it, but just because someone dislikes your taste in music doesn‚Äôt mean anything bad about you.   
I do have an overly sensitive side, and unfortunately, it‚Äôs a heavy burden as I can take offence quite easily because of, again, some low confidence. I do try to work on it, but it can sometimes ruin my day (all too easily)! I generally don‚Äôt engage about such things again though if my friend is obviously not interested. And like you say, I don‚Äôt show stuff that are obviously too foreign for them to understand without being weirded out or confused. It‚Äôs like that meme where there is someone left trying to explain a ‚ÄúTier 4‚Äù meme to a curious person with not enough experience in the interwebz!  
I love synthwave and one time a coworker came into my office and asked "What is this Super Nintendo bullshit?" I laughed and laughed.  
‚ÄúHi Super Nintendo Chalmers!‚Äù I would have done the same, but then also cry a bit inside lol! It‚Äôs a little upsetting because I have also had that at work before when they say, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this video game-y sounding music? I was listening to the Shovel Knight soundtrack as I recently beat it and was addicted to the sounds! But the response had such a condescending undertone on it that I was upset and turned it off. I don‚Äôt like to disturb anybody generally, so I just adhere. That‚Äôs still great to hear how you took it though! Synthwave is awesome, never stop listening to it for more than a couple days.  
I know I have terrible taste in music (Nickelback, Five Finger Death Punch, etc.) so yes. I definitely enjoy listening to my kind of music alone, but if someone passes me the aux, I freak tf out  
My very first rock concert was nickelback. I was ten years old and I don‚Äôt like telling people.   
My first concert was Van Halen - the original band. I went at age 14, and it was awesome. My second concert was Quiet Riot. Never heard of them? Yeah, some of us are still trying to forget. Lol  
You can't bury Come On Feel the Noise.    
It says something that their best song was a cover  
I‚Äôve tried. Oh, how I‚Äôve tried...  
I know what you mean.   
Wait,  Five Finger Death Punch = horrible taste? Welp, guess I have horrible taste then  
FFDP is probably my favorite band right now. Just above A7X.  Most places on reddit has music snobs that will tell you all of FFDP‚Äôs songs sound the same and that they have no talent.  I don‚Äôt give a fuck. I love them.   
What are you saying? FFDP are awesome!  
Five finger death punch are awesome though.  
I know what you mean. I have a music degree, and I also am a secret Limp Bizkit fan. I am so ashamed   
Keep rollin  
Why?   
No...I was doing the Limp Bizkit lyric thing.  
Yo, go look up the 80's remix to Numb by Nickelback right now. I'm obsessed <3  
FFDP is considered horrible taste?   
LOOOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH'!'!!!'!!1111"!!!!!  
That anxiety as your favorite part is coming up and they're talking about something....  
[deleted]  
Since when is The Streets bad?!   
Yep. I love pretty much any metal, but most my family hates it. Was told a lot that they don't know how I can listen to "that crap". It's still kinda hard to believe it when people have the same taste in music as me.  
You just have to be proud of who you are and what you enjoy. Nobody can mock confidence.  
I agree.  My advice when they play your music is dance, dance, dance!  
Most of the music I enjoy is because of the beat/melody/flow, so I don't pay too much attention to the lyrics. When playing the music for someone else is when I first seem to notice how repetitive or dirty the lyrics are. Although I do enjoy dirty lyrics, but mostly because I see them the same as saying a dirty joke, where I can't take them seriously.  
Read my mind. If the lyrics are intelligent I‚Äôll crank it up no problem.  
Partially, but on the other hand the Icelandic folk music and 20 minute long field recordings of a convince store and songs made entirely of Japanese children screaming on my playlist will make you even more uncomfortable   
A little, cause I know very few ppl in real life who listen to the same type of music as me.  
Not one person I know IRL listens to more than 2 or 3 artists in my library. Even then, they only know like radio singles. I thought people these days were all about the indie shit? Just me?  
No, everyone loves trap and pop rap now. I listen to backpacker rap (conscious rap) and they just are not interested  
Yeah, I'm definitely not interested. As you would not be in my Swedish twee or my British folk. Different strokes for real my dude.  
Absolutely. I think it‚Äôs because music is a huge part of my life, and I feel like showing people my favorite bands or songs is akin to revealing something very deep and personal to someone. It‚Äôs me being vulnerable   
well put  
A handful of songs I truly enjoy just sound odd to some people or I would think it would sound so and I get pretty exited yet anxious about it  
Oui  
We have SONOS player at work. When I play my own personal playlist I get slightly anxious if people are going to like what I play.   
Oh I hate when people ask me what kind of music I listen to. I never know what to say because I‚Äôm not about to share what I actually listen to.   
Sometimes I make playlists to share with my girlfriend and then sheepishly apologize for every song üôÉ  
Same goes with when I'm playing the piano by myself and when I play infront of my friends  
Same with movies.  
[deleted]  
This put the funniest image in my head. Ty  
That's interesting because a bearded guy in his 30s that I know (who always has and still does love metal & grunge) loves K-Pop üòÇ  I like it on the occasional Saturday morning when it's on TV & I'm hungover üòÇ   
yeah, I try to show my friends Rush and they thought it was 'Janis Joplin gone mad'.   
And even then i'm sure you showed them tom sawyer and not the necromancer  
metoo  
there's this song called teen idle that I listen to on repeat like all the time  
Yes. This is why I'm very selective about the music I listen to with other people.  
My fianc√© is a total music snob so when I put on my music and I've got a mix of stuff, including some shitty pop that I like because I have good memories associated with it, there's always an elitist comment about how it sucks. I know it's not good music, it just makes me feel good? Excuse me lol  
Definitely, unless I know for certain they're a fan of that particular genre.   
YES! With all media really - music, movies, etc.  
Me all the time  
Considering all the Black metal music I listen to, yeah totally   
Absolutely. My playlist on Spotify consists mainly of music from movie soundtracks, orchestrations people made themselves,  random rock and alternative songs here and there. I've never met anyone who has the same taste in music as I do so the idea of sharing my music with anyone else makes me feel uncomfortable and self-conscious.  What's worse is that I go to a school where everyone loves listening to current popular artists, and then there's me.  
10/10 IGN can relate  
All the damned time,   
Yea lol, Taylor Swift  
Absolutely   
Nah. Fuck people.   
I think that's the opposite of the takeaway here  
Is it? When I show off my music and they don't like it I just think, aww man, fuck people. They don't get it. So, no I don't get self conscious and fuck people. Lol.   
Yes, all the time but I don't care  
Yep. If this is the case, it means I only like the beat/instrumentals but find the lyrics dumb.   
Me all the time. I try to compliment people‚Äôs music tastes for this reason, even if I‚Äôm not crazy about the song   
Certain songs I do. Usually for stuff that's really cheesy but I like it anyway.  
Funny you mention it, I just had this experience while showing my friend my favorite new track by Kings of the Sea - Lobstahs  
I'm like that with everything. Not just music. Movies, shows, books. I get so anxious showing people anything I really like.   
I know that my music is the best and everyone who doesn't enjoy it just doesn't get it. Just like I don't get some music other people love either. No need to feel ashamed for that!   
Yep. I like almost anything, but I never really went deep into underground music, or the back stories of artists, or anything like that. I just enjoy things I can tap my foot and sing along to. However, my boyfriend has been playing guitar for 30 years and a bit of a music snob. He isnt a jerk about it, but it's hard for me to listen to what I consider "comfortable background music" when he always has something to say about how unoriginal something is, or its lack of musical innovation. Sometimes a song doesnt have to be amazing to be a hit, and I wish more people could be cool about it.  
No. Cause the music I listen to is really good. And everyone I've introduced it to claimed its really beautiful epic music.  https://youtu.be/OyRkWSpagis  
Nope, I like showing music to friends. Unfortunately I‚Äôm a Death Grips fan...  
Sure, but then this is also a good reason for me to analyze why I like a certain song.  If I actually like something, if I genuinely like it, I am more than happy to share it with someone.  
I don't get self conscious about it but I know when they're not gonna like it.   
All the time  
Never felt this way  
Not at all, unless it‚Äôs profane and it‚Äôs inappropriate for the situation. I have very broad taste in music, and I know people won‚Äôt like some of it.  For example, I‚Äôm a major One Direction fan, which isn‚Äôt really popular among adults, so I know I might get shit for it. I don‚Äôt care, though, and I‚Äôm very open about it. On my playlist, you can go from Never Gonna Give You Up to Neil Young to One Direction to Weezer to the Eagles and all kinds of pop and rock in between.  
Sort of, but in a way I don't care. My fiance likes Kings of Leon, I definitely don't. He also likes Danzig and country music so he really can't put down my tastes in music, which are mostly hits from the 60s through the 90s.  
I don‚Äôt share the music I like with people unless they specifically ask, mention that they like the same songs/artists, or seem interested.   I hate the feeling of sharing my favorite songs with people and then getting a ‚Äúmeh‚Äù reaction, or no reaction. My favorite songs are like, my life blood, so it stings a bit when others can‚Äôt even pretend to understand where that feeling comes from. However, I do admit to being underwhelmed when others try to hype a song or artist for me that I really SHOULD like, but sincerely don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm able to fake enthusiasm for the sake of being polite, but I can relate to the other side of it too.  
I absolutely feel this way about the music I write.   This description nails it.  
I dunno what other bands give this kind of feeling to you but being a Sarah records fan growing up in the heart of Miami booty bass, there was never a time when it was ok to share my favorite music with friends.   
Most people generally don't enjoy black metal, so I usually try not to show anyone what I listen to.   
Yes. Oh my god yes.  
Glad you agree!  
Kinda yeah, because the conversation usually goes something like this: Me: Let me play something on the speaker Friend: Alright, play something good 30 seconds later Friend: What the fuck is this trash But honestly, we're friends and it's just innocent poking, I respond the same way so it usually ends up with the fight about who can play bigger trash than the other.  
I listen to really obscure music, so I avoid showing it to anyone. I don't feel comfortable sharing my music tastes to others as well.  
Man nobody else seems to appreciate Grant MacDonald like I do  
I wish I could give all of you a piece of my "don't give a shit" attitude because I know I can't just tell you to not care about what others think of you or the stuff you like. Just do you the best you can!  
I liste to a lot of stuff like chill step, jazz and math rock. I wonder if qnyone is even into it. Thwy always say its elevator music. But... In a good way?  
I do the playlist thing for people, let them check it. Have several for a bunch of different people . Some songs make you think of certain people, or you just know there taste . So I hook them up. There always saying how come I haven't got a new track on my playlist in awhile? In which I probably have several that I just haven't got to doing it yet, and they end up with 10 tracks , rather then one every once in awhile.   
I actually think most of my music taste is awful and confusing. My most listened to bands are Metallica and Fallout boy. I also love the sound track to musicals. Everything is a guilty pleasure to me, so I let my more musically discerning friends take the aux cord lest anyone learn my dirty secrets.   
No. I'm very good at knowing what music will be popular with whatever audience and I choose music accordingly. I don't play music I love but don't think others will like for other people. If people are around, I'm a DJ. I play what they want, not what I want.  The idea that some people have "good taste" in music and others have "bad taste" in music is ridiculous. It's all completely subjective and there are so many genres. For instance, I hate country music. You could be a country music connoisseur with a collection of the finest country music ever produced, but that's not my cup of tea so I won't enjoy myself no matter what your tastes are.   
I feel so anxious during the whole car ride when I have the aux   
I've given up on that, but it's facinating.  I perceive time much differently when I am alone and enjoying the music without judgement like when showing it to others. I realise the music can have 4min intros I thought were 30 secs.   
A lot of people are just not open-minded to music. If they have not heard I on the radio before, they think it sucks.  
Hey, MotoMola, just a quick heads-up: alot is actually spelled a lot. You can remember it by it is one lot, 'a lot'. Have a nice day! The parent commenter can reply with 'delete' to delete this comment.

There is an artist I have loved since I was 18. I don't tell people because A.) As a solo artist, no one knows who he is because he never got popular in the states. B.) The band he was in isn't popular anymore and only their super popular songs are even remembered.  I still listen to him all the time and I follow him on Facebook because he's super involved with his fans. I saw him in concert twice but not in about 18 years. I don't want people to make fun of me for liking his music.   
Yeah. I turned on Disturbed‚Äôs ‚ÄúDown With the Sickness.‚Äù I was super pumped to share it with my friend and had the biggest smile on my face waiting for the ‚Äúoh wa ahahahahah.‚Äù She turned to me and said ‚ÄúWTF is this? This sounds like some sort of goat slaughtering music.‚Äù I learned that day that David Draiman isn‚Äôt for everyone.   
kinda feel like anyone who still hasn‚Äôt heard Down With the Sickness probably isn‚Äôt going to like it lol  
Lol. Good point. I supposed it‚Äôs not super mainstream and takes a certain mood to listen to. I like to listen to it when I‚Äôm angry or trying to get in the right frame of mind for work.  
Absolutely!  I love 80‚Äôs hair band music but, I will never play it around others.   
I used to feel this way about John Mayer, but I eventually stopped caring about peoples' perception of my musical tastes. If I think someone is incredibly talented, I'll wear that shit loud and proud!  
Lately I been listening to a shitload of breakup music. I can tell it makes my friends uncomfortable/sad for me üòÇüò≠  
No  
I listen to alternative & rock music and for me as a teen, if you don‚Äôt listen to rap or pop your trash go everyone else. Too many times when somebody told me my music is trash, yea that‚Äôs ur opinion, and my opinion is rap is trash (now a days, i find rap from early 2000‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs were the best)   
Like many others, I totally feel you on this. And I think your question pertains to in-person sharing, but on a media note - I kind of miss the days of making a tape or burning a CD for people. A Spotify playlist just seems sooo impersonal. Sharing a physical object either implied trust if it was your only copy or that you value the recipient to spend a little money and time to make them a copy. I have very slowly introduced my girlfriend to my music library since we've been dating, and I make her elaborate CD cases and handwritten track listings. I know it's 2018, but we have three concerts lined up to see in the coming months  :)  
I listen to a lot of Bill Wurtz and Jack Stauber, which both seem like just absurdist comedy at first, but I've found after a while they double as really great music. I never listen to them without headphones though for that exact reason  
Especially if it‚Äôs in a different language. Idk why.   
Life of a Chief Keef fan   
yup  
Yes. I am a huge Taylor swift fan and she is constantly made fun of and criticized by all the people I hang out with and they role their eyes when I mention her. I‚Äôve just adapted to listening to other music around them.   
This is the shit I come here for  
Yes. I do üé∂  
Nah, my mentality is usually "Fuck y'all this is fire!"  
OMFG YES  
YES  
No, I don‚Äôt give a shit.  
I'm 22 years old and I mainly listen to classic rock with some indie rock thrown in there. Most of my peers listen to Drake and Childish Gambino. It ain't easy being born in the wrong decade.   
Yes and I would absolutely love to hear any tips of avoiding this!! Except for pretending the ‚Äúthing to do‚Äù isn‚Äôt actually happening - ugh !   
Yes...or if ‚Äúthing to do‚Äù isn‚Äôt even that stressful or a big deal at all. Like, I‚Äôll be all uptight if I have to call my mom later. Tips, please.  
Give yourself an hour buffer for whatever and try to live your life as your otherwise would. You can get cleaned up and 15min to wherever (physically or mentally) within that time window regardless of plans and their potential to change. It helps me, most of my friends work in the service industry so things always happen later than my schedule.  
and then you dread waiting for that hour buffer slowly approaching.  
Better add another buffer  
So glad I'm not alone with this though really trippy to see other people describe the exact same feeling I get over weird little things   
Just turn off all the lights and hide under the bed. The world will find someone else to torture.  
Heck, I start worrying about it the night before...  
Set an alarm and forget about it until the alarm goes off is what I do  
Thanks, I might try that! Like set it for 30 mins before the task and then you only have that time to think/worry about it.   
Depends what it is but essentially yeah. Like if I'm going out later in the day I'll set the alarm for when I need to start getting ready.  
Same- and I won't allow any thoughts about the thing to enter my head.  
I‚Äôm 31 and have had this problem my whole life. Recently I stumbled upon the alarm technique on my own and it turns out that it works great, at least for me. Perfect example was Christmas Eve and stressing about family dinner at 5. Usually I would have frittered the whole day away but I set an alarm for 3:30 so I had plenty of time to get ready then enjoyed the day. For me, I think the stress comes worrying I‚Äôll get too involved with something and forget to get ready on time, or even go.  
Hello! Could you please expand on that? You got ready before 330 and then took an hour to chill? How did you calculate how long it would take you to get ready and what time did you start?   
well great now i can‚Äôt do anything because my alarm is going off in 5 hours. i‚Äôll just start getting ready...  
Then I just get even more pissed that it interrupted the show I'm watching or something I'm actively working on. It just feels worse when you have to leave just as you're getting in the zone, especially if it takes a while.  
I think we're supposed to "live in the moment". Please let me know if anyone figures that trick out.  
Idk. Try mindfulness/meditation. Heard that works.  
Do all the things immediately. Alternatively, if you have free time tell yourself (for example) "I need to get to the end of the level in this game" So it makes it onto your to do list.  
On days I have to work 2-8, ill be up at 9 and not even get out of bed until 1 because I know once I get up my free time is over. I honestly feel like forcing yourself to get up and shower helps ease the tension of "well im already in my pajamas, I may as well do jack shit until I have to leave" feeling.  
I know it‚Äôs been like 5 months since you posted this, but I wanted to respond with what‚Äôs helped me the most! I have a job that requires me to start work around 4-6pm depending on the day. So if I wake up at around 7:30, it gives me about 8-10 hours of free time. 8-10 hours is usually longer than whatever shift I‚Äôm working, and even if I saved all of my errands to do on one day, I could probably still get them done in those 8-10 hour days.  Obviously not everyone is the same as me, but once I‚Äôm done with all those errands, and side task and whatever else, and I still have a few hours before work, that‚Äôs when I just kind of mentally shut off for a bit and watch some tv or play some video games. I can only do that for so long before I get bored, but by that time it‚Äôs time to go to work, and then it feels like a whole new day! Instead of napping, I just ‚Äúshut off‚Äù for a while and it makes me feel like my weeks have like 10-15 days just because of how I break it up. I know this is a huge ramble and stream of consciousness but it‚Äôs really helped me not feel overwhelmed and like I have too much to do in one day. TL,DR: If you work late or have something to do late, make sure you get everything you need done well before that time comes, and take the time in between to mentally shut down for a while.  
Thanks heaps for your reply! That sounds like a good approach to get the things done early and make sure you have chill time before ‚Äúthe thing to do‚Äù. Appreciate your advice :)  
Not everyone can do this, but I just take a nap before doing whatever it is that I need to do. For example, half the week I‚Äôll have to work around 4 pm. I get up around 9 or 10 am and enjoy my morning or do a couple of chores/an errand. Around 1 or 2 I‚Äôll take a nap and then wake up around 3 to get ready for the evening shift.  I used to always work those hours and it was rough. I would stay up all night and wake up super late into the early afternoon. It felt like my life was work, sleep, and chilling by myself all evening or drinking. My current routine works best for me. The only downside is that on my days off I get tired around nap time.  It still feels like a countdown for the day, but it‚Äôs much more rewarding forcing myself to get at least something productive done.  
I try to channel that energy into productive things while granting myself a very nice lunch. If I need to do something at 5, I will be busy until that time doing chores, cleaning, taking care of tasks, etc. When lunch time rolls around, I will take my time creating an amazing lunch. Epic sandwiches, tasty flatbread, a philly cheesesteak, or whatever else I'm craving. I take my time because I've earned it. Once I'm done, back to the grind until the event. It doesn't fix the problem, but it makes things way more tolerable.  
The solution for me is to find MORE things to do! :D This way, I can turn a wasted-rest day into a productive day where I did a lot of things, like: Fixing that lamp, adjusting that drawer, oiling that hinge, buying the WD-40 that ran out, fixing the car's engine, and explaining to your wife when she asks why you didn't fix that lamp yet :P No, seriously, those wasted days are worth it if you know how to exploit them correctly. Edit: Other than that, set an alarm and plan the day AROUND that thing you need to do.  
Honestly, try setting an alarm on your phone. For whatever time you feel like you'll need to start legitimately mentally preparing.  
For me, I sit down and completely overthink what I need to do that evening.  I will calculate exactly how much time I will need and what time I need to do each thing in preparation, e.g. Need to get ready at 8:45, need to pack up baby stuff at 9:05, need to be done wrapping the gift by 9:40, need to leave by 10:00 to have a 15 minute buffer to account for traffic. Once I work out all of that, I set an alarm for the times and strictly follow my schedule and do whatever the hell until my schedule is supposed to start.  
I put this elsewhere but I just set an alarm so I can tune it out until it‚Äôs time to go/get ready.   
It almost feels like a countdown, and I can't enjoy my time without, worrying about it. Even if it's nothing to even worry about.  
Because IT IS I feel like there's a timer just counting down the time until I have to do the thing Every time I look at the clock, I calculate how much time I have left. I am the timer.   
I will set an alarm and forget about it. The alarm will allow me enough time to put stuff down and get ready to leave. Ignore clocks and enjoy a book until then.  
Yep.  Most days I work from 11 to 7 at night (out the door at 10, home by 7.30/8 ish) and people are like ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you just do x, y, z before work‚Äù and it‚Äôs really hard to get myself to do it.  I‚Äôm up at 9, which is fine because I can sleep late, but I just can‚Äôt imagine getting up at 6 and use those 3 hours for anything productive   
I have the SAME schedule! Feel the same way.   
It‚Äôs so, so annoying, and everybody around me is just ‚Äúoh nice, so you can spend the long morning training/cleaning/whatever‚Äù.  Tried talking to my boss about getting more early shifts and she‚Äôs saying the same thing.  The days I get off at 4 or even 5 is luxury to me.   
100% agree. I sometimes work 12-8pm and I just can't get anything done in the morning, I tend to just stay in bed til the last minute and stay up later at night.   
Maybe find out what time in the night you need to shift gears and start getting ready. Set an alarm for that time and just forget about it and live in the moment   
Tried that, it seemed like it should work, but I never trust the alarm so then I keep checking the alarm over and over again.  
For some reason, I never developed a full trust in my iPhone alarm. It has screwed me and not gone off maybe two or three times for important things so now I don‚Äôt rely on it. I find the Apple Watch alarm, however, extremely reliable. I recommend having a vibrating timer on your wrist that always goes off when you need it to  
Yes and it makes me look like a bitch who can‚Äôt relax...or maybe it just makes it more apparent that I‚Äôm a bitch who can‚Äôt relax.

Yep, definitely. I feel like I need the entire day off to truly feel ‚Äústress free.‚Äù   
And the next day.  
Seriously. Around 11pm Friday, I start stressing over 9am Monday.   
lol - i start stressing about Monday 3pm on Sunday  
The Sunday Scaries!  
Yeah I need two days off to have any recovery. And the first day off is just me convincing myself that i can actually relax lol.   
Always. I can't relax if I have any commitments in the day at all.   
I've been struggling with this so much lately. Also included is my "should do" list. So I can't truly relax until everything is done and I have zero responsibility. It's exhausting even though it's really not that much.   
I have a lot of anxiety related to being on time. This mostly just means that I'm early for most things, but when I have obligations later in the day I get really nervous about doing anything else for fear that it will complicated the timeline and make me late. What has helped is scheduling stuff beforehand. If I need to take my mom to the airport at 5pm, I'll pencil in an hour to do cleaning or shopping, make a plan for lunch, etc. If I have a solid idea of what I want to get done -- and if I block out time for it -- I can better gauge how I'm doing on time and then I won't feel like I'm going to be late for an evening commitment just because I want to spend 30 minutes watching a TV show at 8:30 am.  
Are you me? Seriously the worst thing is trying to do nothing beforehand, keeping busy helps so much. It's ironic because I used to be a lazy slob but thanks to my anxiety I have such a clean house!  
Yes! I always get this with doctors and dentist appointments too. It happens with any appointment really. It sucks.   
[deleted]  
Same! I honestly try to schedule any responsibility things in the morning. This weird countdown anxiety has turned me into a "morning person."  
I work 12:30-3:30 pm Monday through Friday. Sometimes I‚Äôll stay in bed until 11 to get ready, then I feel guilty for not getting up earlier to get stuff done.   
I regularly do this, to my shame. To avoid that uncomfortable feeling of waiting around with the clock ticking I'd rather go back to sleep for another hour or so and pretend it isn't happening.   
This is too real.  
I'm glad it's not just me.  
You only work 3 hours a day?  
Not sure but I've always assumed this was an ADHD thing, since for me it's all about being afraid I'll get distracted, forget about the time, and then either be late or miss the thing altogether.  Because of course that really has happened, more times than I like to think about.  Glad to know I'm not the only one.  Well, not really -- sorry others have this too.  
That's so interesting I've always put this down to my anxiety - I'm not worried I'll forget about it, it's just this ominous looming dread. Hugs to you my fellow brain weird friend x  
This is absolutely an ADHD coping mechanism for me.  My mom hasn‚Äôt learned to cope and I‚Äôll find her trying to water the lawn or do dishes as we need to be walking out the door. She often forgot to pick me up from my club at school and was always late for everything. I recognize those same tendencies in myself and have developed some perhaps rather unhealthy coping mechanisms to avoid being like that. So I spend my entire day watching the clock. Can‚Äôt do the dishes, I‚Äôll get distracted. Can‚Äôt do yard work, I‚Äôll get distracted. Can‚Äôt clean the house, can‚Äôt vacuum, can‚Äôt do anything slightly productive.  So that adds another level of anxiety because my house is a mess and I have things to do but I cant focus on them.   
For me it's not about fearing of forgetting but about having to waste the time I got till it happens so I can be ready at time, otherwise I can't relax if I'm doing an important thing before another important thing.   
Literally assumed I was the only one, didn't realize how much this very thing bothered me until I just read this dae... thanks so much for your post! Even if I have a nail appt, or some silly doctors visit that will take 15min, it's on my mind all day until I go:( I do this with EVERYTHING, actually except, strangely, for work (kind of). I work nights 7p to 7a...I wake up at 4p and do the typical pre- getting ready stuff (eat, coffee, read, etc...)but don't allow myself to think about work or contemplate what sort of shift we're likely to have until 530p... that's when I shower and get actually ready for work.  Really a frustrating habit, being obsessed with whatever is coming next rather than living in the moment,smh. EDITED for "Eric", (lol it was etc...), and a few other typos!  
[deleted]  
Maybe he/she ‚Äúdoes‚Äú eric? What a luck guy.  
Same, it's just the unusual stuff that makes me feel this way. Got school at 8am? I get up at 7am and I'll be fine. Have an appointment at 6pm? My whole day will be wasted in anticipation  
I literally thought I was the only person with this problem.    
Me too! I never even considered that other people might feel this way.   
YES, I hate feeling like I have a deadline on my relaxation.   
I think this is why I prefer scheduling things earlier in the day rather than later  
Yeah I think I‚Äôm with you on that. Most of the time at work they have me closing because they can actually trust me to get stuff done, but I would love to get home at sometime that isn‚Äôt like 10:00 and have an evening to myself.   
Yes!  Sometimes my job requires a ‚Äúhalf shift,‚Äù either only morning or only afternoon.  I ALWAYS opt for the a.m. shift when possible because I hate waiting for the p.m. shift.  
I worked 7 days a week for three years. My weekends would be marred by knowing I had work at 4. I would be grumpy if we had errands to run and got back to the house after 12 because to me the whole day was gone. I finally got to a place where I didnt need to work on the weekends anymore and it has been a vacation ever since.  
Yes, it's anxiety.  
Just reading this gives me anxiety. A good thing that I do is set a timer for like a half hour before I need to do it that way I know I won‚Äôt forget(I forget a lot with add) that way I know I‚Äôm going to do it and deal with what I have to do. After that I try to forget about it and be present in the moment. For me anxiety used to play a big role in my life. I have almost overcome crippling anxiety by practicing mindfulness.   
Yes always!!! I absolutely cannot spend my day comfortably if I have an obligation later. It really sucks because I feel this way even if the obligation is something enjoyable   
And I thought I was the only one. This is absolutely relatable and kind of problematic in my life  
Yep. Something that has been helpful for me has been practicing mindfulness and staying present and in the moment. Checking in with each of my five senses helps with this. Meditation would probably also be helpful.  
This is exactly why I always make sure my butler has a to-do list.  
Yeah except make it month instead of a week. Essay deadline in 3 weeks? Yeah let's worry about that every waking second so that I can't enjoy anything and the angst makes me completely unproductive to the point that despite being worried a long time in advance I'm rushing everything at the last second and performing poorly.  
MY WHOLE LIFE IN SCHOOL  
That is exactly how I am too.   
yes but i have started to do something lately that really helps me  ill just tell myself ill think about it later or i set a specific date or time for just thinking how m gonna solve my problem that's it that way i avoid keeping my self worried the whole time   
Yes! Work now rest later I always say. If I don't get whatever done right away I'll likely never do it.  
100% Me. My friend was talking about all this stuff we could do in one day and then go to work later in the day. I was just sitting there unenthusiastic about the plans just because I knew the dreadful feeling of having to go to work later would be there  
YES. It‚Äôs like a weight on my shoulders, or a looming deadline.  
Honestly, I think this is why I don't really... do anything... I've gotten so in the habit of not DOING anything that I also sit and do nothing on my free days, too. Got into this habit years ago while in a toxic relationship and haven't gotten out of it. I'm sure my depression has to do with it too.  
Yes! Ugh it drives me crazy and I'm not sure how to do thinking like that   
YES  
Yes!   
Yes and I have no clue how to deal.   
This is exactly how I am. I can't go do anything as I'm too tense   
I feel unconfortable if i feel like i will waste time not doing anything productive, like this christmas dinner, it was nice the dinner then the gifts, but when you dont have anything else to do besides being around people...i just wanted to go home to rest and have a me time, going around my pc, instead i was falling asleep at the table looking to the air tired...i had to work this 2 days.  
Yes! On Saturdays I bartend 5pm-12am and every Saturday I can‚Äôt do anything and just dread it all day long. It ruins my entire day.   
I bartender for 10 years. I feel your pain  
Yes. And the countdown to the thing gives me major anxiety. I dread it. I feel like the world is going to end when the time comes.   
Ugh yes. I have family who loves to have their get togethers and parties at 2:00 pm on Sunday afternoons. The worst.   
I have had this problem. Now if I work later or have something to do later, I will give myself a time frame. I make a time when I have to take a shower and get ready. Before that time, I will sit down and hang out. Maybe I will watch a tv show I recorded. You have to train yourself not to  worry about what you have to do later. You have to find a way to get comfortable.        Anything you need to bring with you when you leave, you should have that ready the night before. If you are all set up and ready to go, then forget about it. Let it go.     Personally I went through the same aniexity you are feeling and I still go through it, but I have been better at it.      If I didn't adapt, it will drive me  mad.   
All the time. Every time I think of something I want to get done, whether it‚Äôs big or small, I have to add it to a to-do list on my phone or else I‚Äôll be bothered for eternity.   
Absolutely. Its why I became a morning person. I work out early and like an earlier work shift/schedule so when I'm done, I'm free!...unless I have a social engagement. But now have limited those greatly too.  
same here   
Yes, and I delivered pizzas at night for years. Looking back I'm not sure how I didn't lose my mind.  
I totally get this and something that has helped me recently is to try to consider myself when busy and myself when free to do whatever two different people? Sounds weird but if I really focus on imagining that there are two versions of me, a 'busy' irise_s whose entire life is being busy and an 'idle' irise_s whose entire life is being lazy and having fun it helps me be more in the moment with either state of being  
I think i've figured it out. It's all about the meaning you assign to your task. Just ask yourself why are you so afraid of it. Then try to come up with arguments why are you wrong. If you miss/do an error with the assingment - it's not the end of the world. And there is no point of worrying about it now. Be rational. Also, it usually doesn't works if it isn't you who comes up with the arguments. Some basic meditation attempt could help too.   
Yes! Only the anxiety it creates is so awful for me that  I cannot make plans. It sounds crazy but awful.  
I think this has to do with perceived importance of the event that is making you anxious. I am not saying I know the solution to this problem, but maybe having a plan b in mind can help you relax a bit.  
I totally get that feeling. One way that has helped me deal with it is to actually just lean into it. I try to schedule all the things I have to do on the same day so then it will be a productive day. I was going to be stressed about it anyway, might as well channel that energy. Or if the things on my list are flexible, I try to get them done as soon as possible to leave more empty time for myself stress-free  
This is literally me right now  
Work days don't belong to me. They belong to the stress that eats at me minute by minute before I have to finally go. I can't do anything entertaining, rest or eat comfortably.  
This is the main reason I gave up being a musician. Rehearsals/Performances are usually at night. When teaching the earliest people wanted lessons were about 11am. I would have anxiety to the point I would cancel the lesson, as I just couldn't do it as it ruined my WHOLE day. I now work 6am - 2pm in a "normal" job and my depression is 90% better. No hanging around, I wake up @ 4.45am, get ready and leave. The work and people are awful, so anxiety and rage is bad, but depression is a-ok.  
I feel you 100%  
Yep. I thought I was the only person. Everyone seems to handle their days so gracefully, meanwhile I'm a ball of tension. I just had a 4 day "weekend" but I barely felt like I could do anything because I had to listen to the "goings-on" in the house üòì

Yep  I'm exactly the same!  
üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I feel tense and like I can‚Äôt relax all day.   
I set a timer for when I have to start getting ready to leave then instantly feel more relaxed   
Same  
Yep  
Yes, especially when I have to work at night.   
It doesn‚Äôt keep me from doing attention grabbing things but it tortures me endlessly having to leave in the middle of it. I‚Äôd rather get everything done so I have nothing to worry about but like you I work in the evening so it‚Äôs either deal with it or wake up at 4pm for me   
Yes, but I set alarms for when I have to start getting ready and that helps a lot.   
Sounds like classic anxiety?  
Yep. I waste so much time.  
I used to feel that way when I would have to work an afternoon/evening shift. I haven‚Äôt had to for years and now I‚Äôm a stay at home mom so work starts as soon as we wake up. But I‚Äôve lost the anxious part of I plan on doing something with my son later in the day. I‚Äôm too busy worrying about his schedule to think about my own and I think that helps haha.   
So much so!! I got a bit better at it in university, since some days I didn‚Äôt have classes starting until noon or later, or I had morning classes and then a weirdly long break. I like to set an alarm on my phone (30 minutes to an hour before I have to leave/be ready) and then try to do anything to fill the time. Watch TV, do some quick chores (like laundry or dishes), take a quick nap. But it definitely makes my day feel weird!  
All the time. I try to get everything done before 7  
I am this way too!! It doesn‚Äôt necessarily prevent me from doing the things I need to do it‚Äôs that I can‚Äôt actually unwind in my mind with things having over my head. My husband does not have this problem and looks at me like I‚Äôm crazy when I try to explain this to him!   
All the time.  
Yes or the next day  
Yes and it's especially frustrating because I work 3pm to 11pm   
I definitely have this problem. Sometimes the anticipation of something just kills me.  
yup. im just working part time at a department store rn. sometimes i don't work till 5 or 6 pm,,, and on those days i still feel like my day is shot. i usually will just sleep till an hour or two before i have to leave for work   
M.m  
Ruins my damn day.  
This is why I hate working PM shifts. I literally just have it in the back of my mind that I HAVE to enjoy my day before work, otherwise I won‚Äôt enjoy it at all. I feel the pain  
Sometimes it is like that for me but most of the times it's the stark opposite.  I hate having fuck-all to do. Still haven't mastered the arts of shooting the breeze.   
Depends on what the thing is. If it's something I enjoy, no problem at all relaxing, sleeping, w.e. Something I hate/have to do/something I want to do but gives me anxiety, I'll have trouble doing anything prior, if it's the dentist....i won't even be able to poop in one go....  
Yes!! I stay at home with my son so if we have agreed to go to the park, shops, whatever, with someone, I much prefer to do it in the morning else I'm anxious thinking about it all day. I want it over and done with as early in the day as possible so I can come home and hide! ITT: a bunch of introverts!!  
Yes so much. It drives me crazy. Anxiety bs or what?   
This goes along with not being able to sleep because you have something to do the next morning. Anxiety is a bitch.   
I saw the title and came to say how I had to pick up my wife at the airport at midnight a few Sundays ago, and couldn't relax all day because of it. So yeah, exact same experience here. Even though I just lounged at home watching football, I had way too much nervous energy to really relax.   
Yep. And it sucks when my shift for work is 6pm to closing at 1030 or 11pm. I‚Äôm like...well I‚Äôd love to do something but work...  
Yes followed by my discomfort bordering on intolerable if there‚Äôs any potential traffic involved.  I despise the unknown. Rather it be done so my anxiety can take a breather.   
It all centers around anxiety.  Set an alarm that allows you plenty of time to do anything you need to do before you leave, such as shower.  Then practice some breathing exercises which will help the anxiety.  Breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, breathe out for 4 seconds, hold for 4.  Do this 4 our 5 times until you feel your mind and body calm. Not a total solution but it helps me.  Anxiety sucks!  
Yes! I've worked from 7pm-6am for the past 12 years. I get home from work in the morning and have trouble sleeping due to the fact I have to wake up at 5pm to get ready to go to work again. Plus, anything my kids may have to do that I have to transport them to or from. It's awful. I also am diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder. The only thing that has and does help me is taking a prescribed xanax every morning.  
I've never related to a post this much, if I have an important dinner there's no way I'm focusin on anything else the whole day, I envied my sister because she could pull off a bussy day and even do extra while she was at it.   
Yep, I completely suffer from this. I can‚Äôt commit to any long tasks during the day leading up to an event, for fear of missing it I guess? I don‚Äôt even know. It‚Äôs even worse if people are coming over or I‚Äôm having a party, because then I just feel like I‚Äôm waiting around until that event happens since I‚Äôm looking forward to it.  
I feel some type of anxiety when this happens so I set an alarm for the time I have to get ready/leave out. This way I can tune out the upcoming activity/responsibility, chill and not check the time until the alarm goes off. I often have to go back to work in the evening etc. This helps me a lot   
This is actually what helps me to not procrastinate and put things off till later. Because I can't relax knowing I have get off my butt eventually.   
Oh.my.god. Yes! I can‚Äôt relax or feel comfortable if I have anything to do later in the day. I‚Äôve always been like this and I hate it. I literally thought I was the only one because friends and family can‚Äôt stand that I‚Äôm like this and they have no problem with it like I do  
Did I write this? I was just saying this the other day üôÑ it sucks   
If your issue is anxiety over being late I use the ‚Äúarrive by‚Äù option on google maps. Whatever time it tells me to leave by, Leave 15 minutes earlier and you‚Äôll never have any issues (hopefully)  
I havr this same feeling!!! It gets stressful to be honest  
Set a timer for 30 min increments. Do small, but productive tasks that aren‚Äôt projects but help everything keep moving forward. Wash dishes. Gather/sort laundry. Gather all trash and deposit it in the big refuse container. Sweep or vacuum. If it helps more, use the time to prepare things needed when you leave...clothes set out, keys, bills, etc first. Then do the little tasks. Helps me and I don‚Äôt feel overwhelmed on the one day off I have.   
Mental slavery  
Sameeeee like night exams  
i cant stand doing shit at the end of the day as well.  That's why i try to schedule appointments as early as possible, or get my shit done at 11 or 12 at the latest, or go the gym at 830 am.    
I truly understand what you‚Äôre going through! I get home late, have to make supper, food shop, do laundry, catch up on patient chart notes, and clean my house, LOL! So, I‚Äôm not really sleeping in, I‚Äôm trying to keep from losing my marbles. I‚Äôm not good in the morning and don‚Äôt start my workday till 11 because my neck/head hurts all the time, I‚Äôm prone to migraines, I need to be up for a few hours and stretch my neck and have a decent breakfast‚Ä¶ Meanwhile, everything is hitting the fan‚Ä¶ Phone calls, emails, texts‚Ä¶ It just never ends. And I am the sole breadwinner of the family. That weighs heavily on me mentally.  
During undergrad (almost 10ys ago) I worked as a promo girl for Camel tobacco - paid great but my shifts were always 9pm-2am. I felt stressed all day when I knew I had a shift coming up.  I vastly prefer takin' care of business before engaging in leisure time.  
yeah. I work mostly nights so the daytime before work always feel a bit stressed. I am constantly thinking about what I will have to deal with at work later and cannot do anything that would make me tired, inebriated, or late to work. So half the time I waste my free time. After work I enjoy my free time heavily!  
Yes definitely  
Yes. This mixed with constant procrastination = my life sucks.  
Truth  
It's not that I trust Reddit more, it's that I want to see discussion on what I'm googling, not just an article by 1 dude  
Definitely this. Also lots of articles/blog posts tend to give corny or unrealistic advice and are generally annoying to read.  
Don't forget the abundance of ads and autoplaying videos on those articles  
Don't forget to subscribe to this and tell your friends!  
Don't forget to ring that bell, like, and subscribe!  
You can add a bookmarklet to your bookmarks toolbar that kills overlays like the "disable your adblocker" banners and "subscribe to our newsletter" popups. It will also kill those annoying videos that play in the corner even when you scroll down. Just create a bookmark and add the following javascript in place of the URL:   javascript:(function()%7B(function () %7Bvar i%2C elements %3D document.querySelectorAll('body *')%3Bfor (i %3D 0%3B i < elements.length%3B i%2B%2B) %7Bif (getComputedStyle(elements%5Bi%5D).position %3D%3D%3D 'fixed') %7Belements%5Bi%5D.parentNode.removeChild(elements%5Bi%5D)%3B%7D%7D%7D)()%7D)()   
You are fucking amazing. Didn't even think of using JavaScript for that. It's such an amazing language  
Which I could maybe deal with if there were comments..... nothing is worse than seeing ‚Äú0 comments‚Äù  
Yep. Especially if the article still leaves a lot of questions unanswered.  
Almost any thread on other websites has intentionally useless responses that just lead to arguments. Steam's the worst for it. Been doing some research into getting better Cemu (Wii U emulator) performance for PC lately. One reply I found was "Try this.". It wasn't even funny the first 5 separate times I saw that comment (or something like "just get a Wii u")  
Also something (probably) more current. Not some BS from 2008.   
Or it won't even have a date and you gotta do some detective work to figure it out.  
Well, everything posted on the internet has a time/date stamp somewhere, but I see your point.   
Also not drowning in useless articles from useless websites who just want to earn a quick buck by making sensational articles. Some topics are IMPOSSIBLE to google because of this, several pages of Google Searches will be nothing but weird blog-ish websites publishing editorials or useless articles that wants you to scroll through 5 pages of intrusive ads to give you an answer that could have been given in one sentence. New videogames are especially bad with this, with every site trying to publish their own little article. Searching anything related with GAME will give you hundreds of game websites with their own little mini "guides" or useless walkthroughs slathered in ad-content. I could be searching for ways to solve a specific bug and all I will get is MOUNTAINS OF TRASH ARTICLES.  I swear, Google is becoming more and more useless every year because people know how to game the system. The only way to avoid it is to search for specific websites.   
Recipe blogs are the fucking worst for this. I don't need a 10 page story about how this recipe is your family's president's day tradition because it saved the family dog's life somehow.   
I'm going to use this exact excuse next time I'm accused of spending "too much time" on reddit. Cheers!  
also because reddit search engine sucks  
It‚Äôs absolutely awful.   
I hypothosize that it's done on purpose, to promote reposts and thus create more content.   
It legit, straight up doesn't work. Period.  
Wow, such empty!  
THIS. Google is the KING of search.  
duckduckgo would like to have a word  
Quack Quack quack quack quck  
Quack Quack quack quack quack  
Quack Quack quack quack quack  
Not because I trust reddit more, but because the answers are more realistic and diverse.   
[deleted]  
Some answers require more of a professional knowledge though, so reddit is not exactly the best trustable option.   
I‚Äôll seek a second opinion for anything serious but edit comments often have multiple perspectives along with multiple sources if you‚Äôre willing to dig a little.  
I love the answers that have links, and then a written breakdown of the information in the link. That way I can just double check that I understood everything alright.  
In my experience reddit threads are more likely to have answers from professionals or people with personal experience than articles from generic content machines that are often the alternative.  
True. Depends on what you‚Äôre looking up I guess.  
True, but you don't have to trawl through several articles to find a few links that you then have to trawl though to get the answers you want. Here you can get all that on one page.  
Yeah it‚Äôs not because i trust Reddit more, it‚Äôs because I want actual discussion/opinions on the topic by real people rather than landing on some shitty slideshow that‚Äôs SEO‚Äôd to hell and likely written by someone completely disconnected from the topic at hand   
And i know its from people's actual experience not some people who write articles out of their asses.  
I wouldn't say it's diverse because things tend to swing towards a circlejerk, but it is a good place to get a general read on something.   
Plus the auto correct usually puts it in anyway.  
More specifically, I add "site: reddit.com" so it only searches reddit. Also, for anyone wanting to search for a a certain thing, put that phrase in quotation marks.   
Don't put a space though  
Almost always! The alternative is ending up on Wikipedia or random blogs that could be saying anything to get readers. I prefer getting a reddit thread with actual anonymous people‚Äôs testimonies, I always learn a lot   
Definitely, reddit users would never say anything to get attention.  We prefer to be inconspicuous and not keep track of 'likes' Btw I don't trust Wikipedia either, when has  it ever helped anyone?  
LOl I like you~ tho you have to admit it‚Äôs more obvious on reddit when someone‚Äôs just asking for karma  Haven‚Äôt used Wikipedia in ages tbh  
The reference section on Wiki helps though  
All the time, I feel like reddit is Where real humans talk.. the other sites, perhaps bots

Then welcome to the team friend!  
Fuck yeah .. Reddit knows everything first .. im pretty sure even the television news media get their info on reddit since it almost always appear here first . Plus the community is awesome .  
Nice try reddit. Nice try.  
And -pinterest  
Can't believe I'm not the only one!  
Yes. But it's not about trust, reddit just has varying opinions to offer and you can usually get objective view by very small amount of analysis.  Regarding topics that require professional knowledge, I use reddit as "navigation": Finding out where people get their data from, then checking various sources and their accuracy.  Really useful site.

bonus round: add inurl:/r/doesanybodyelse to refine by subreddit.  
Or just site:reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse  
Thank god, I thought I was the only one  
Yup. I know there will be varied and more answers.  Some concise answers and some that go into detail.   
No.  I append site:reddit.com  
Absolutely. I find that more people are willing to share that they've found a solution to a problem on their own on Reddit vs something like Stack Overflow.   
I do this constantly. Whenever I can‚Äôt seem to find the answer I‚Äôm looking for, I add ‚Äúreddit‚Äù to the end of my search. More often than not, I find the solution.   
Yes, it tends to always give me a better curated response  
yes  
I do it all the time  
I do this every time   
Yes! I can't upvote this enough!  
that's exactly what i do, for the same reason. or i just go on a question sub and post something there.   
Always lol  
Every time bro  
YES  
I do it because reddit has more answers overall than the usual sites. I like to see a reason why a thing is a thing or that way   
This. I thought I was the only one. But like others i don‚Äôt always trust it more, but most of the times the answer is much more decisive and to the point. You can also get multiple opinions without reading the same thing over and over again.  
Yes! Especially with recipes! Sites like allrecipes and whatever reviews seem.....fake to me. I found some really good recipes by doing that!   
It depends on the topic and what subreddit I want answers from.  
Well it is the front page of the internet. üëç  
Google sometimes spits out Reddit results.  That's how I discovered it to begin with.  
all the time  
I do it because Google's search is far superior to Reddit's.  
Me! I do this all of the time!!   
every single  
I do this for porn. Lol  
Absolutely. I do this so often with designer software tutorials or troubleshooting. I remember trying to download Gwent on my MacBook as it's windows only and I added Reddit after my search I found a post where some user had written out an insanely complex guide on how to do it. Would never have found that had i not  searched Reddit   
I want to thank you. I got an advance copy of a game that hasn't been released in the states yet and I've been needing some help. Google searches were getting me nowhere. Then I thought "gasp!! I bet Reddit users have a thread for this game and that there are people all over the world playing it and then they can answer questions and I can answer questions!!" So you just made my day, literally! Thank you!!  
Psst, which game?  
Yokai Watch 3. Got ahold of a UK version and let's just say I've already sunk in 40 hours over the last week.  
I just recently started doing just that and I haven't been disappointed. I get a much better quicker answer  
IM SO GLAD IM NOT THE ONLY ONE !!!! but I‚Äôm still new to reddit so I guess that‚Äôs why   
No, but I have had to circumvent network restrictions at work in order to research a problem because often the answer was tucked in the comments of some Reddit post. I honestly haven‚Äôt used it for leisure Reddit use. I prefer mobile > desktop.   
I‚Äôve done it before  
A lot of time Google added reddit to the end of the auto complete.  
All the time for anything I know Reddit has the answer to  
Add this to your search Site:reddit.com   
Yep, pretty much every non programming question I have.  Seeing the various opinions helps a lot. Especially with purchases.   
I‚Äôm usually hoping NOT to get a reddit result bc I want to share on fb something I FOUND on Reddit, but I don‚Äôt want the requisite reddit link. I want the original site linked.   
I do now, even when I would do a regular search I would frequently get "reddit" added to my search in  the drop-down menu and at the bottom of the page in "related searches".  That is actually how I ended up here, "If I can't beat them join them" or some variation of that.   
Not necessarily. But in some cases I do trust reddit more.  
I'll throw 'forum' on the end after seeing what reddit has to say  
Use Duck Duck Go  
80% of the time  
I put Reddit before my search terms  
everytime  
Yes  
Type this into google and it will only list results from reddit: site:reddit.com how to get a blue and yellow striped fishing umbrella out of my arse  
I don't have to. Any time I search for something, Reddit is one of the first results in Google.  
site:reddit.com  
Yes and I often type eli5 to narrow it even further.  If I just want a quick answer to something, I don't want to dig through a bunch of filler nonsense in an article.  Reddit threads usually immediately tell me precisely what I want to know.  Reddit gets to the point.  Writers of articles usually just ramble on trying to meet that word count.  
i do this just because i usually get a more straight forward short answer rather than having to search a whole ass article for it  
Indeed, although sometimes reddit purges results when your search has some keywords (for example incels irrc) so you have to manually set site:reddit.com ( i actually have a bind for that one)  
DAE get bored of seeing the same DAE all the time   
I don't know if I trust it more or just know that it will give real,  personal accounts that are potentially relatable.   
[deleted]  
[deleted]  
What's wrong with using Reddit's search bar?  Type a few words and sort by relevant/new and see what pops up.  
DAE see this exact same posting being posted at least once a month?  
No.   
You should have searched your question on Reddit. It's pretty much a weekly repost.  
Nope.   
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha... No  
100% of the time!!  
For tech support like for emulators and such, absolutely yes  
OMG YES!!!!  
started doing it on a regular basis this year )  
I struggle with this daily. Each night I resolve to do better. Alas, the abyss consumes again.  
Please be easy and gentle on yourself. The abyss is fed by the shame, if you are able to break the cycle of shame/struggle, if you can be just a little kind to yourself, it might help. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with you, you‚Äôre a good person. You‚Äôre good enough.  
the hardest part is starting, and the expectations you put on youself ten percent of something is better than 100% of nothing (100x 0 is still 0 but 50x0.5 will get you something greater than 0) so just tell yourself you'll do one thing and you don't even have to finish it, just start. you'll often find that you can keep going. but if i really really want to stop after i've given it ten percent then i let myself stop and it's not a failure because i made some progress  
This is so me!! I‚Äôve learned to put small boundaries in place to help motivate me. Even though I work three jobs and earn less than $25,000 a year, I always make sure to keep $60 every month for a cleaning lady. I make the money an absolute priority. This is enough to keep me sane. I‚Äôll invite a (close, understanding) friend over to sit in my kitchen and drink tea and chat, while I clean my kitchen. I‚Äôll trade homemade cakes and treats with my neice every 10 months or so, and she comes over and helps me organize stuff. I do the same with my small garden. If you are willing to let people in to your circle, and try to put aside the shame of not being motivated, you can find some creative ways to cope. The shame is toxic, and holds us back. And we aren‚Äôt shameful xx  
Hm, wonder if this is what I feel. I'm definitely unmotivated.  My job is so fucking easy to me but it's hella boring. The only reason I'm still there is because of the decent pay.  I'm not motivated to look for more, and I often even lack motivation to do things that I want or used to love.  I've straight up told my closest friend that I've lost motivation, but she's the only one I've told.  I'm working thru it by brute mental force at this point. I guess my only motivation is money? Like I just want to be lazy for a month while still getting paid.  
There is lots of research studies out there that tell us money doesn‚Äôt motivate us. (Once we have the basics - food, rent, shelter.) how long are you going to be able to keep up the brute mental force? Good on you for keeping going, because a job is better than no job, but I wonder how much energy is being sucked out of you by the brute energy. Maybe try to start small - really small. Treat yourself. Have a favourite coffee on the way to work twice a week. Force yourself to compliment a co worker on his nice red sweater. Buy yourself a pair of your favourite socks. Wear them. Maybe a haircut that makes you feel extra fly. Reach out to random people on the bus - just a shared smile. But really notice when you‚Äôre doing these things. Hey, I am wearing my favourite socks with the flamingos on them. Good for me! Hey, that co worker I never really got along with seemed super pleased that I noticed his sweater. I did a nice thing, brightened his day. Best of luck to you. Life can be hard, we have to do little things for each other.  
 (Once we have the basics - food, rent, shelter.)  That's the key. Studies have shown that people who can afford to be unemployed have drastic spikes in happiness.  But those that are unemployed and in financial distress have that happiness tank.  It seems pretty "duh", but it's interesting when you delve deeper into it. I've been unemployed for about 6 months.  The intention was only to be that way for about 3, so I had a small nest egg to float me and I was extremely happy focusing on new skills, hobbies, and enjoying life.  Then the pandemic hit and finding a job was now impossible, and my safety zone came and went.   Now even though these little things once brought me great joy and self-development, I can't bring myself to be productive and do any of it because I'm just consumed with anxiety and fear that I won't be able to find a job. I have no motivation to cook, clean, or continue my studies.  Happiness comes from doing the things you love, but basic needs will always need to be met first. I'm not motivated by money, I'm motivated by living the life I want.  Unfortunately I need at least some money to do so. Therefore money = happiness, to an end.  
Totally hear you on this.  I'd say my motivation is power. I've seen how money grants (would say buy, but you get to keep your money) power through politics in my country. I want to make money so I can make my country better.  I brought this up to one of my deepest thinking friends and he told me that although I want to make the world better, I'd never be able to make everyone happy as my definition of happiness could be wildly different from someone else's. This i understand. My mind Immediately went to "damn, guess I gotta buy a planet and start over". It's a joke but then that lead the convo to the nature vs nurture debate.  
Well said friend.  
Where do you live. Not sure how it is now with the pandemic but I made 30k one year as a part time server with three days off. It's honest work and I worked hard for that admittedly.  
I live in one of the most expensive cities in Canada. I work two jobs for the City, about 28 hours a week, auxiliary, no benefits or paid sick leave, no medical or dental, no eye care. And I cater for about 5 clients a week, out of my house, about 25 hours a week. I‚Äôm too old and cynical to wait tables.  
thank you so much  
Ugh, yes. Or not doing THAT thing because there's something ELSE that has more of a priority, or there is something I started but didn't finish. But thinking about doing that thing that has greater priority gives me anxiety so then I just end up doing nothing instead.  
this. and then all the other things i started but didn‚Äôt finish gives me anxiety and i can‚Äôt do anything.  
Haha yep! Some days I‚Äôm an OCD cleaner, some days I sit and watch tv in near tears over all the dishes, laundry, and organizing to do.  Sometimes just picking out one thing to do helps start the day. You‚Äôll feel better once one thing is off the list.  
I have been in the same boat. What really helped me, (actually straight up solved the problem) was audiobooks. Once I started listening to them, I started finding excuses to do chores around the house so I could knock out more of my book. I couldn't just sit and listen to it while doing nothing, I'd get too bored.  
This is actually a great idea!! I love audiobooks, as long as the voice isn‚Äôt annoying ha!  
A few of my recent favorites: (been through about 100 in the past year) 11-22-63 - Stephen King Pet Semetary - Stephen King The Fourth Monkey - J.D. Barker The Way of Kings - Brandon Sanderson (book 1 of the best series I've ever read) The Expanse series - James S A Corey  The Blade Itself - Joe Abercrombie These have the best narrators out of all the audiobooks I've listened to.  
Wow, thank you so much for the recommendations! I‚Äôm going to check them out!  
I alternate between podcasts and audio books.  Thank god Audible will allow you to return a book you purchased if you can't stand the narrator.  I can't stand it when the s is too sharp and it hurts my head.  I've had to request a refund on a couple of good books because they were not remotely listenable. A couple of other good ones that I enjoyed (Audio books) - Where the crawdads sing - Delia Owens  (Great Narration) - Artemis - Andy Weir (Narrated by Rosario Dawson) - Commune Series ( Joshua Gayou (Narrated by R.C. Bray) Hopefully you'll find a few good things out there.  I'm going to try this see if I can get through house cleaning.  I hate having a messy dusty place but most days I just can't deal with it and all the other stuff on my plate.  It can be overwhelming.  Hope it works for you too.  
Might have ADHD friend.  
I was scrolling for this comment. Definitely can relate to this... ADD  
pretty sure...  
Sounds like executive dysfunction, whether it be from depression, ADHD, trauma, etc. Shit sucks. Hope things get better for OP  
Yup! I have been this way my whole life and I‚Äôve been making an effort to change it, slowly. I try to be kind to myself, the reason why I‚Äôm putting it off is because I want the result to be perfect. But how can ‚ÄúI‚Äù make something perfect? As soon as I start harping on how great I want something to turn out, I psych myself out of even trying.  Now I wake up and give myself 2 priorities. They don‚Äôt have to be big, just something I want/need to do. I owe it to myself to show up for myself, to TRY. Set 2 priorities (example; mine yesterday were (1) to make a beat loop and (2) clean the dishes). I made a beat loop and it was terrible, BUT I tried. I sat down and go it DONE whether it was good or not. Next time I will be more prepared, next time it won‚Äôt be perfect either, but damn at least I tried for myself. Look up the Pomodoro technique for organizing your time as you work. Very helpful  
"I owe it to myself to show up for myself" - I think I'll use this as my mantra for the rest of 2020.  Thanks!  
That's exactly me with the perfectionism! Have tried to change for so many years, it's hard to think I ever will. Thanks for the pomodoro technique I will try that in the morning.  
Every. Single. Day.  
I'll reply in a bit, I'm just so stressed about all the stuff I gotta do today! üòì  
Yep! There‚Äôs a great 15 minute Ted Talk that I watch whenever I‚Äôm waaaay in the cesspit! I‚Äôve linked it in case it interests anyone.  Ted Talk Procrastination  
I‚Äôve seen this talk so many times you won‚Äôt believe it lol  
Been struggling with that for weeks now. Working myself up with anxiety of working, end up not doing it for a couple days, then nearly break down trying to get the nerve to check my inbox. Depression and anxiety are fucking hard.  
Yup. And it‚Äôs usually something that takes like 15 min. I will sit there for eight hours thinking about it. Not wanting to do it. I procrastinate because I always end up getting things done. But the little hint of anxiety that‚Äôs there until it‚Äôs done is haunting.  
Totally relate on that!  
Hey bud! You sound a lot like me. Have you ever looked into adult ADHD? I still struggle with procrastination and anxiety, but I found that my diagnosis and treatment really helped. If these symptoms sound like you, you might want to ask your doctor about being tested for ADHD. Even the peace of mind from a diagnosis can be an improvement on your quality of life. https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-symptoms-checklist/amp/ Best of luck  
I'm doing this right now and it's an actual problem. I know I should be doing stuff but I can't get myself up to do the things  
Same here happens all the time  
Literally doing this right now. Pray for me  
Yes. But it is very important that I comment here and mindlessly scroll through Reddit for another hour before I can tackle my to do list  
This is 100% me. People always talk about the fight or flight response but they always forget or don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs actually fight, flight or freeze, and I‚Äôm a million times a freezer. When I get too overwhelmed by my anxiety I completely freeze up and shut down mentally. I have to try and break whatever task up into smaller parts, then break those parts into smaller parts ad infinitum until I get to a process I can complete, and start taking on each of those microscopic parts until I can complete a task. Or part of a task lol.  
Me too. That Thanks for articulating this.  Me today!  
That's what ADHD is for me.  
Me too. It‚Äôs a vicious fucking cycle in university  
This happens to Me too, so is there any anxiety involved or just the adhd?  
Yep. I personally have been dx as anxiety, depression and ADHD. Every case is different.  
Same here, but it just makes it a lot more confusing. After years of trying to figure it out and into my adult life I try not to think too Much about the diagnosis  
This has been me for weeks ugh  
happy cake day!  
Happy cake day!  
That's why I'm here instead of cleaning the house!  
I used to do this so bad. It was usually due to my mental state. If I was in an abusive relationship/if my overall environment was not great. I found taking little steps and positive mantras really helped me. Saying things like, "if I do this then it's better than nothing." And I could slowly manage to tell myself that I was being productive because I did 1 single thing that day, but eventually the positivity for this grew and I did 2 things on another day, then it keps growing. I would have break days within this and I realized I was still doing better than when I was doing nothing at all. It slowly made me happier with myself to start. Long story short. Yes. I very much understand this feeling but I give into it way less than I used to. I find the anxiety is the drive to move, so we just need to listen. Even if that's just 10 jumping jacks, a good meal and some water to start. <3  
[deleted]  
I‚Äôm fucking doing that right now.  
Yes... sometimes. Lately though, I'm able to get out of the cesspool more often than not. Here's what works for me, sort of a mental checklist when I can manage to be aware that the waters of the cesspool are rising all around me.  Put the phone away. Seriously, just put it tf away. I find that the less I'm on my phone (besides music, and I try to use an external bluetooth speaker when indoors folding laundry or cleaning up/organizing, etc.), the better I feel in general. Books, doing nothing, walking in nature or people watching - all of these things are WAY better for our mental health because they inherently calm the monkey mind that Buddhists often refer to. Lay down in a quiet place, maybe (if you have the willpower to not open a browser or reddit) put some white noise or soft music on your phone. Bring with you a fiction book, a notepad, and a pen or pencil. Either stare at the ceiling or read a book, something NOT related to motivation or self-help. Just wait. Eventually you'll either fall asleep, stop reading and feel better, or your mind will begin to arrange itself in such a way that you'll WANT to get up and do something. Don't just yet. If you feel your mind arranging things in such a way that they feel doable, let it keep going. Whatever it is you need to do - organize the house, start writing that novel, following up on sales leads, WHATEVER - write down the tiniest step that you can think of. It could be as tiny as actually getting up and walking over to the computer or to that pile of dirty clothes. Then write down the next step - put clothes in hamper/open gmail/Take that box down into the basement, etc. Keep writing down the tiniest, most incremental of steps. The kind of stuff that, if you just did it, would be done in under a minute. Keep going until you've got six or seven manageable steps, maybe even ten if you're feeling really motivated now. Put checkboxes next to each step - THIS IS IMPORTANT. Checking them off will give you a shot of feel goodness in the brain and body. Get up and promise yourself you'll do just the first one. Not two or four or seven. Just one. Try very hard NOT to do more than one. It is 100% okay if you fail at this step.  Point being that sometimes we're just constantly picturing the whole elephant, not realizing that most stuff gets done in a series of tiny, mundane steps that in and of themselves can feel like accomplishments. The key is to identify these small steps and make them feel like accomplishments. The big ones will ONLY get done when you've identified and completed enough of the smaller tasks. Paperclip your little lists together, stick them in a drawer and let them pile up. In a week or two, look back at all you have done. I GUARANTEE you'll feel like a million bucks if you stick to this practice.  Another mental trick I use is the ten minute rule. You can do anything for ten minutes or less. It's often hard to stop yourself, though, once you get going. Promise yourself ten minutes though, get a stopwatch or an egg timer, set it and go. Even if you stare at the wall for ten minutes, you at least showed up to work. Now try again and I'll get you wind up doing something. Just remember - PUT AWAY THE F****** PHONE. They are DEADLY when it comes to procrastination.  
Too. Many. Days. ‚òπÔ∏è  
This was me yesterday. Now I get to rush through it today since I needs to get done!  
Yes, and the worst part is when it's something I enjoy doing such as writing.  It become an insurmountable task and then I hate myself for not doing what I like because of that fear.  
Honestly, this has become my first wish from a genie to remove this aspect from humanity so people could accomplish what they wanted and live free of that burden.  
...and then finally you‚Äôre laying awake at night because you‚Äôre so anxious and end up doing tons of tasks in the dead of night.  
I had to check the OP name to make sure I didn't somehow post this and forget  
Story of my life.  
Sounds like a normal day for me LMAO  
IsAnybodyElse talking about me?  
Sometimes it helps me to set a timer for like 10 minutes and clean a certain area as much as I can in that time. Small areas like my desk, my dresser, or my closet. Timer goes off and I switch to a different area.I know that if I don‚Äôt set timers I‚Äôll spend hours halfway cleaning my room and taking lots of breaks. Struggling everyday with anxiety leads to struggling with depression. Depression sucks. Finding little anxiety hacks can make a big difference in your day. Good luck!  
Yup. I always find if I set my intentions for the day (put on meditation music in the morning) and say ‚ÄúToday I am motivated to finish xyz. These tasks do not consume me. These tasks are simple‚Äù blah blah blah it helps calm me down so I can focus on one thing at a time. Give it a try!  
This is happening to me right now as I type this.  
I do this all the  time, especially when my mental health isn't good for various reasons. What helps a lot for me is to remind myself that action precedes willpower. I force myself to start and try to stop thinking about everything that needs to be done. It usually works.  
i used to be like this then i realized that the anxiety was actually worse than just doing the thing. and the reward for doing the thing was tenfold better than not doing the thing.  
sounds a lot like me, 33m with adhd. Have you ever tried the pomodoro technique? It really helps when you're faced with a stack of shit to do that seems insurmountable.  
when i was in college, i would just go to sleep. Panic wake up and did what needed to be done, only to find myself still in my room with class about to start in 5 while i lived 5 min away from campus and my class was a 2 min walk from the closest stop. But, hey, it'll all be over Friday. When I officially graduate!  
Been doing it for years  
You might have adhd pal  
Pretty much every day.  
EVERYDAY!  
This happens to me all the time. I try to make lists sometimes and that can either help or hurt me in motivation. If a list looks too long, it starts to feel daunting or impossible. I‚Äôve noticed though that my anxiety only gets worse the longer I sit with it. I try to think about which discomfort that I would rather deal with. Usually I‚Äôd rather deal with the discomfort of starting to clean or do things for work than feel anxious any longer and that becomes motivation in it‚Äôs own. On the other end of things I also feel that I start doing different tasks to avoid both. If that happens I try to make that different task a reward for doing the mandatory task. I start by doing a little bit at a time and take breaks with the other thing I thought about doing. Usually once the ball is rolling on something though, it‚Äôs easier to keep doing it for the rest of the day and keep the motivation going (with the help of some coffee).  Ive dealt with Generalized Anxiety, Depression, PTSD, Panic Disorder, and Social Anxiety. So this has really been the best option for when I feel so bad.  
Actively doing this right now  
Paralysis by analysis  
Currently doing this lol.  Moved in with my boyfriend into our first house recently. Holy shit being a 'homeowner' (I rent, he bought) is a lot of work. I'm not even working right now and all I can seem to do today is stare into space/at my phone. And the ADHD doesn't help *sigh.  
I learned a thing years ago. Its called the 3 minute rule. You start one task and do it for at least 3 minutes. If you're not feeling it, you're done after 3 minutes. The idea is that once you start you have motivated yourself to do more than the 3 minutes. It has about a 8 out of 10 success rate for me. Either way I know I tried, and that makes me feel a bit better. Anxiety guilt and depression are soooo hard to get past. Good luck!  
This sub helped me a lot.  GetMotivated Hopefully it will help some folks here as well.  
I didn't give you permission to write my life story. For real though this happens so often. For me, there's only 3 outcomes:  Recognize what could get me to this point and try to avoid it (getting things done before it gets this bad) Recognize that I'm in this state and there's nothing I can do about it. I'm too anxious to get anything done, so I take a step back and do something I want to do instead. Either way I wasn't going to get that task done, and by choosing to do something else it (in theory) reduces my guilt about the whole situation. At least I'm doing something instead of doing nothing.  Recognize that I'm in this state, the task has to be done, and sitting in this feeling is not going to make it any better. Kinda like "I'm going to feel like shit either way, so I'll feel like shit and get the thing done." The only way to get past this feeling is to do the task. It's scary, but I take small steps to at least get started. This usually happens 5-6 hours into the procrastination/anxiety cycle.  I still struggle with this a lot. I wish there was a name for this or something.  
Yes. Military paperwork especially causes me a great deal of anxiety.  
This happens to me often so one time I googled it and found out it has a name: workload paralysis!  
This is a adhd symptom , I also feel like this  
Who are you and why are you in my brain?  
Me, on reddit, right now.  
Every. Single. Day.  
I feel you! I have been dealing with this feeling for a long time too, it really sucks but you can overcome it. Some things that work for me and helped me ease my anxiety issues are: - Start my day by doing my bed. This might sound silly but it feels SO good to start your day with one thing done already - I have a to-do list where I write down things I want to get done in my day. I try to be honest with this in order to avoid including unrealistic things or things that are out of my control. This is a trial and error approach that you can improve and adjust over time. - Keep it small, break it down into small things if possible  It‚Äôs not bullet proof, it‚Äôs a daily exercise but it helps me to keep things organize. I hope it helps! Edit: im not a native english speaker so sorry in advance for any mistakes :)  
Clean something. Best way to break the cycle. Always helps me. Even something small like the dishes. Do one thing and you'll feel motivated to do others. Hope you're feeling OK.  
Definitely!!! I have to much to do and then I freak out trying to figure out what would b the best way to tackle it all!!! Then I‚Äôm lucky if I get a few things done for the day! Never enough time in a day to do ALL the things I need/want to get done!!! Then I have more to do the following day but the anxiety just continues üò©  
Its called analysis paralysis.  
Yeah, most of the time I give up but sometimes I say "ill work on that for 5 min" and that often gets good results  
currently in the process of doing that  
Yes and at times can be very crippling. I started to just immediately drop everything whenever I think of something that needed to be done that‚Äôs important.  
Yep. When that happens I try to just focus on one thing, finish it, then move onto the next.  
Yep! On bad days, I make a to do list. But thats all. Making the to do list gives me some peace, an illusion of control, which allows me to nap the day away with less anxiety in my stomach.  
Hell yes!  I also find myself waiting for that moment or even whole day where my depression lifts/my energy increases and then I try to get ALL the things done before the next fall down the rabbit hole occurs.  
Yes, it happens all the time. The only solution I have found so far is to finish the work as soon as it is assigned to me. If I delay it, its a lost cause.  
I am with you. Anxious as hell as someone has to take the kids to school. And that is me. Trying not to think of the stuff to do after.  
me but with my life :)  
Only when you mention it  
All the time  
Why would you call me out like this?  
Yes very much so, especially right now. This is a common trait for people with anxiety.  
Thats me today  
I'm doing this right now and I hate myself for it :(  
Final exam is in less than a month and I have yet to finish my presentation, I spend my days playing the Sims cause they don't have exams in that game  
Yes, especially since everything I do is going to cause pain.  
that's me in every school project. if the deadline's in two weeks, I'll stress myself out for 13 days then actually do something about it on the last day  
r/oddlyspecific but yes, yes I do.  
Big mood.  
I‚Äôve been doing it for the past weeks. It sucks  
Omg yesüòÇ  
Hey, are you talking about me? Sound like me, in this rigth moment, lol.  
Yes. It means I always leave essay until last minute and my anxiety then gets even worse. If anyone has a trick for how to stop this cycle, I‚Äôm all ears.  
Here's something I learned. Make a list of the things you have to do. This helps a lot. Try to do 3 things on the list and cross them off. Do it every day. If you need to, make "write a list" number one and cross it off. You will feel major accomplished!  
That and the rising feeling that I‚Äôm simply not good enough so why even bother trying to do anything. Sorry you‚Äôre going through it too..  
That's me  
I am currently on Reddit avoiding finishing up a really easy assignment, but nOOooOOOooo, I need to be a piece of trash about it.  
sadly I have this, when I‚Äôm stressed out, living unhealthy (not eating good, not drinking as much as I should, hanging too much on my phone, no physical movements at all) makes me tense even when I try to chill once, I mean you want to chill, you need to be healthy, you want to learn or do something get a clear mind and a healthy routine, it‚Äôs okay to have lazy days where your dopamine drops, but it shouldn‚Äôt be your daily lifestyle if you really want to achieve shit. when I was younger I always thought I just needed to get up and learn or do something, but nah you really need to be on tracks or your mental health will suck more because of your physical health.  
Doing it right now. We have a national holiday today and I had SO many plans and wanted to be SO productive. Now it's 6pm and I haven't done sh*t yet. Just constantly thinking "if I want to get this and that done, I should really get moving now". And I feel so bad about it -.-  
Only every day lol  
Are you my daughter?  
adding to the ‚Äúthis is me everyday‚Äù comments and YUP i have adhd  
Absolutely. Organization does not come easily to me at all. It doesn‚Äôt even come hard. I just never even know where to begin and even when I start I get sidetracked and more piles form. I end up creating more projects that I then get stuck on and the cycle continues.  
this happened to me. i was on a roll waking up early every day and i realized i have so much work and chores to do i just keep sleeping in lol :(  
I technically don‚Äôt have to do anything right now but i have this creeping feeling I‚Äôm forgetting something and I‚Äôve been anxious all day bc of that  
i find it best to figure out "what needs to be done first?"...then do just that. usually that is enough to get me started and i will continue with the rest.  
Can relate badly to this one.  
Ya , one this that kind of helps is knowing that procrastination just makes it worse and keep it alive and well, action is the only way to stop it . Also if you can just get started, tell yourself only for a couple minutes , a lot of the time you actually get into it and keep going , but you just have to start somehow  
What do know, I‚Äôm doing that now! Reason I‚Äôm on this front page üòÇü§£  
Did I write this? I feel this way about vm‚Äôs too. Like oh shit, if they called AND left a message it must be something bad or that I failed to do and I can‚Äôt face hearing it  
Me. I do that. All the time.  
I've found little sticky notes on my desk with 1 or 2 small tasks a day help me. I get great satisfaction from crossing off tasks. Take care of yourself buddy!  
You know me so well!  
Sometimes. But then there's coffee. Too little and I do like the title of this post. Too much and I end up achieving nothing because my mind is running circles around me and I do 10% of everything all at the same time, another kind of anxiety. But hit that sweet spot and I'll knock all that whole to-do list out of the ballpark before lunchtime. It can be done for a few days in a row, but if I keep it up for a few weeks I'll end up completely burnt out but have an immaculate home.  
I was literally just thinking about this today. It is so me. I'm studying at the moment and have always struggled submitting assignments in good time. I never learnüò≠ I get overwhelmed about all the things I need to do then can't find a good place to start, then think I'll start tomorrow cuz I have plenty of time then BOOM. It's the night before I need to hand it in and somehow I've found the drive to type 3000 words I could have spread out nicely over 3 weeks.  
Yeh its got worse in lockdown. I spent 4 hours today wondering what to do. Then just played ps4 and felt much better  
YES all the time. it got especially bad having to transition to online school.  
Every fucking time  
ummmmm..... yes actually this is my life  
Gotta eat that frog first thing in the morning. But yeah, I totally do the same thing, literally for months at a time. I cook on the stove a lot and have a crappy microwave-based vent fan that just spits the grease onto the cabinet above the microwave. It's been that way for like a year. I keep putting off cleaning it, and it stresses me out every time I notice it.  
This feels like a personal attack. How dare you be correct!  
Its horrible. I do it constantly. Im doing it right now!  
Yes. And on those type of days, I tend to gravitate towards microwaved foods. So I make myself do something productive (dishes, send an email, text my mom back, etc) while I wait for the microwave timer to go off. It‚Äôs like a game to see how much I can get done in the 3-5 minutes! I usually surprise myself with how much I can get done.  Sometimes getting one thing done helps me muster the motivation to do other things. Sometimes not, but at least I did something to chip away at the never ending to-do list.  
I've done this my entire life. Realised recently that I actually have ADHD. Started working on that with medication etc. And it's such a huge difference! Used to feel trapped in procrastination, like I knew I needed to do x or y but Ita like I genuinely couldn't get up to do it. Was like a mental/physical block stopping me.  
I give myself a reward for every minor job on my list that I do and a bigger one if I complete the entire list within the time frame. I eat too much chocolate so I buy a bar and give a square to myself per small job and then at the end I give myself permission to put a small amount of money toward a fund for the next thing in my life I want as well as doing something on my list of indulgences. It doesn‚Äôt always work but mostly it‚Äôs led to improvement, otherwise I get so anxious I freeze.  
Me Everyday!  
Always  
Huh? Did I make this post while sleepwalking? /s Yeah, absolutely. This is so me. I hate my lazy ass.  
executive dysfunction disorder, my old friend...  
Pretty sure this is a symptom of depression. At least the horrifying procrastination and the unmotivation. At least that's what I think for my own case. I spend more time sitting around worrying about what to do, rather than just doing it. It's a daily problem that I have yet to find a feasible solution to.  
Used to. Not anymore. I break it down to manageable chunks. No more all-or-nothing approach for me. What a relief.  
EVERYDAY...  how do we get out of the cycle?!  
Story of my life...  
This was totally me in college!  
Litteraly every day!  
All. The. Time.  No, I mean literally all the time. Every day. It sucks.  
Nope. I just ignore the stuff i "have to do" and generally realise its not such a big deal in the end if I dont do it.. If it is important someone will chase me up for it... then Ill do it.  
Not even kidding if you feel this way and feel you just have low energy levels you should really ask your doctor to test your thyroid function. I‚Äôve always been someone that needed to motivate myself a little bit to get going but when finding that motivation became nearly impossible it turned out I have a hyperactive thyroid (Hashimotos). I have no idea how many things the thyroid controlled. After taking medicine for over a year I‚Äôm almost back to my normal semi lazy self. Obviously this advice isn‚Äôt going to be beneficial for most but I‚Äôm happy if it even helps a handful of you.  
Yes. Military paperwork especially causes me a great deal of anxiety.  
Okay wow tysm everyone! I made this post when I was in peak procrastination mode but actually feel a lot better after reading all of your wonderful tips. I hope all of you can get your tasks done, and you‚Äôll be pleased to know I‚Äôve already ticked one off my own list :)  
That's me. Every single non-work day. I love the structure of work. Without it I'm a bit lost!  
Yes yes yes yes just finished a round of it  
It happens. I take pride in an abundance if procrastination as I have been able to avoid some catastrophic fails by waiting a little bit longer than most people but when I go overboard or anxiety factors in all bets are off. I have had anxiety hit me in the grocery store and walk out leaving a cart full of items I NEEDED.  
every.god.damn.day  
Get out of my head  
Dude, this bish about to tell us her life story and sin number  
You‚Äôre def not alone  
HA! Me for the past 2 months  
Yes, my entire freaking life, it'll be stupidest thing too. Like calling to schedule a doctor's appointment.  
Mmmm most days I have lots to do, yes  
This is so relatable. I will lie awake all night stressing about all the things I have to do the next day and then self sabotage with paralysis by analysis.  
This is literally me rn.  
This happens to me a lot - actually write now I haven‚Äôt been able to move my legs even üòÖ Sometimes I just am procrastinating, but at times like this it‚Äôs because of my executive dysfunction (basically my body and brain get mad at each other over something petty and refuse to cooperate). I‚Äôve found that it helps me to write down what I am anxious about and WHY (writing down what I‚Äôm anxious about alone doesn‚Äôt help, but writing down the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô does, for some reason). I don‚Äôt have any decent advice other than that and to hang in there! You are not alone and you are doing great considering you have to fight this!  
Tell yourself to only accomplish one thing. Sometimes getting up to take that shower/make that coffee/go pee is the only thing you plan to do, and a couple hours later everything else ends up being done. And if not, at least it‚Äôs one less thing you‚Äôll have to be anxious about tomorrow.  Best wishes!  
It's amazing to think that almost everyone else has the same problem as you, yet you in your head think that no one else could possibly be this petty and sad.  
Every. Single. Day.  
Nope. I used to when I was a teenager and in my early 20‚Äôs but a series of tough bosses soon smacked that lazy-assed shit out of me. Can‚Äôt be successful if you wallow in idleness. It‚Äôs literally a simple choice: do or don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs entirely up to you.  
Reddit: That's... Why I'm here.  
Me legit rn  
All the time!  
Every single day.  
y e s. can‚Äôt stand reddit on a computer  
Fuck yea, mate, i feel you  
Me....When I get asked for flair, I just excuse myself and leave.  
Sameeeeee  
I use it on my phone but I prefer desktop. I feel like the search function works better, I can have a lot of tabs open at once and easily cycle between them, flairs, also hover zoom.   
[removed]  
I think they just updated its format actually  
I prefer the old design, luckily you can still revert back.  
[deleted]  
Honestly it's not that bad. You don't lose your place when you're scrolling because it opens up something on top of where you left off and all of your subreddits are on the side. I'm a fan.    
It went from the 90s to the 2000s..still pretty lame...the app is cool though.  
Honestly, that's exactly why I like the reddit format. I like the 'outdated', text heavy look for reddit. Maybe it's just because I'm used to it, I don't know. Anyone else feel this way?  
I like it way better on the computer. I don't use the mobile site even on my phone because I can't stand it  
Using the mobile site is dumb. There's plenty of cool apps that have really good layouts that make browsing easier and smoother.  
The mobile-first people probably don't like using PCs in general.  
Use RES  
Don't give them more ideas plz  
There are skins you know right?  
Main reddit is a little long in the tooth, true, but the r/'s that pay attention to their CSS design can be fantastic.   Anyhow I look at reddit 99% of the time on a laptop.  I like it much more than mobile.   I tried the redesign a few days ago and gave it an honest test, but couldn't stand it.    
I‚Äôm the opposite, I can‚Äôt stand the mobile design or the app. For me, the old desktop design is beautiful and perfect, and the current ‚Äúmodern‚Äù view of design in general is hideous. I guess I‚Äôm becoming the minority :(  
Nobody in their right mind uses Reddit‚Äôs official mobile app. Try Apollo. Moved over reluctantly after Alien Blue died a slow death.   
Redditisfun is the way to go.  
I tried the official app and went straight back to reddit is fun.  
What‚Äôs wrong with the official app?   
Other apps have had more time to offer features and themes. People on previous apps don't want to give up pre-fetching, mod options, multiple accounts and other shit.  Official app will spam you with trending messages so everyone else went cool an app then went fuck this.  
Thanks for the suggestion! To be honest, I‚Äôm quite uncomfortable with the idea of using an app to ‚Äúconsume‚Äù a web site‚Äôs material, and I really like the classic look even on Safari on my iPhone. But I will give it a try :)  
I thought that I was the only one... The new design is not only bad looking, but makes it more difficult to browse. It makes reddit more like facebook and every other shitty website cos 'hur dur I dont understand computer reddit'  
I prefer the desktop browser for reddit also.  But I also get tired of all the apps on my phone and just read reddit on the phone browser and THAT sucks.  So i just wait till i'm at the PC to check in  
I am the same.  I have tried several of the apps and just hate them all.  Plus I like being able to scroll through pages on a subreddit and open all the posts I want to look at in separate tabs.  Then I slowly go through the tabs throughout my workday when I've got nothing else going on.  
Reddit on computer looks like it was made in the late 90s  
Yes. Same for me. Can‚Äôt see and the layout on a computer.   
How can you say that?? I could not live without all my glorious tabs.  
Yes, but not e official app. I prefer Reddit Is Fun app.  
Yep, I dont like having to reopen tabs or constantly hit back, but on my phone it's much easier  
Soo much easier  
Just Use RES for that.. But Yeah I use mobile mostly too lel  
Wait I have res... is there an easy back button I‚Äôm missing?   
No but theres a small button that opens the OP.  You can click it kind of like an on off and it opens the post even if it was an external link image. There are also other downloadable scripts to customize it  
Oo I didn‚Äôt realize that. I downloaded res but was never sure what it did. I‚Äôll have to look into it more   
I mean I could do that, or I could just use my phone while sitting at my computer, and one of these is less effort  
I've only been using it on my computer for like 6 years now, never thought I'd be a minority  
Well, I actually have been using reddit for only a couple of days hehe  
Oh, well then give it time. I didn't use desktop reddit until like 3 years in  
[deleted]  
Make me  
READ THE SIDEBAR IT'S ON THE SIDEBAR LOOK AT THE SIDEBAR Yo playa, What Sidebar? Mobile For Life  
You can see the sidebar on mobile.  
It took me far longer than I'd care to admit to know that That was The Sidebar. I'm a Reddit Is Fun guy and maybe... 25% of the time "error loading sidebar"  
Get Boost or Sync.  
I have nothing against the website, I just don‚Äôt browse reddit at home. Usually in between classes.  
I use it mostly at work  
I am part of the dying breed that only uses reddit on a PC. I am actually surprised at how quickly it changed in the space of a few years, I still remember when nearly everybody was using it on a computer and hardly anybody on a phone.  
Time passes, buddy  
Yup, but finding it a battery hog at the moment..  
Really? It runs just fine, battery consumption is not too much on my phone, and i use a 4 year old IPhone 5.   
Yeah, it could be me just on it a lot, but when I check the battery usage it consumes more that YouTube.  I still love using it though haha  
Probably because battery usage stats don't take into account time spent. I'm guessing you're a typical Reddit user that spends every waking minute on Reddit :P  
There's a few different apps out there, I haven't used the default one but the Reddit Is Fun app doesn't seem to drain battery much at all. Especially not on night mode!  
Ahh I love night mode!  
The computer site is simply un-usable. It‚Äôs overwhelming   
That is interesting, because I prefer the computer site over mobile. What makes you think it's unusable?   
[deleted]  
This is exactly why I prefer the desktop site. I don't want color, or quick moving, I basically want every website to look as much like cragislist as possible. Just list everythign in the simplest form possible.   
I guess we are getting old :(  
Too much clutter, it‚Äôs anyone with ocd and/ or anxiety‚Äôs worst nightmare. I breathe heavy just looking at it. Jk but....  
For me I like it because it's more concise. I get to see a great deal of content per page, and read through hundreds of comments quickly. It basically lets me consume content at a faster rate.  
Too clicky  
WTF does that mean? Doesn't the app have the same links, up/down votes, comment buttons? Is the app "too tappy"?  
No! I can swipey to the left and righty to view all the posts without clickety clicking around the pagey wagey   
Don't take it too hard, computing in general is getting "too clicky" for the mobile-first world.  
I agree. Mobile app (Relay) has an easy way to collapse comments, can't find that on the desktop version. I only want to read top level initially.  
Great app, awful website.  
Yes, I don't use it anywhere but on my phone.  
Reddit is fun   
Yep  
Everyday   
I've never viewed reddit on anything but   
I don't know how all of you do that. The site on mobile is terrible. I don't think I could even browse reddit without having tabs. Typing on a phone is worse, finding links for your comments is worse, many website other than like imgur and gfycat load worse on mobile. In general the mobile experience, for me, is just shit compared to a desktop interface (but that is also basically how I feel about every website ever, I hate apps compared to actual websites)  
Yup.  Tabs are critical to the way I view/use reddit.  Also, yea, the typing and linking thing is an enormous pain in the ass on mobile.  
DAE get sick and tired of this question?  
Yeeeesssss....   I like the reddit is fun app MORE than the desktop, even with RES.  
Wait, you means it‚Äôs not just an app like pornhub?  
About 99% of the time I use Reddit is Fun for Android. I never get to enjoy when I'm gilded because the apps features makes gold a bit redundant.  
How so?  
This is literally posted every 3 days   
Sadly it gets upvoted every time.   
Definitely not - I much prefer reading it on a computer, though I have enjoyed using Boost for my phone Reddit app. It's the best I've used (previously enjoyed Reddit Is Fun).  
That would be me. I don't understand how one uses anything else to browse through Reddit. I don't know, I'm just comfortable doing it via my phone. Damn I sound like a brat.  
No, you don't sound like a brat.  
Yep!  
I mainly use Reddit on mobile, occasionally I'll use it on PC tho  
I actually have never had a problem with the website. I think I found the site before I found the app. Reddit RES makes the site a lot more pleasant, you can just press j or k to move up and down through posts and comments, x to open and close images I think it's c for comments. I dunno, and the site just seems really straight forward for me, no useless designs or anything, it's like 4chan where the design is not necessary  
I barely ever use it on my laptop   
I thought that‚Äôs all everyone did   
Me, and then I got pissed when people refer me to the sidebar to read rules saying "IT'S RIGHT THERE!" There no fucking side bars on phones idiots!  
The reddit app on Phone + night mode = perfect experience in my opinion   
I legit have only logged into reddit on my desktop once and almost lost my mind based on how ridiculous the format was. Everyone always posts  ‚Äúthis is from app so forgive the format‚Äù and I legit see nothing punishable   
I have a suspicion that the people who don't enjoy reddit on pc are the same ones that don't know about RES and hoverzoom extensions. I would also prefer the app if I couldn't hover over images/videos or open them with RES. But I would miss having tabs.  
"Reddit is fun" is the master race.  
DAE breath?  
I kind of like the retro aesthetic of the website, but it is kind of annoying to use.  
Are there actually any news about the website redesign?  
just look at my post on r/unpopularopinion   
There‚Äôs a website?  
I'm also mostly on reddit... at work  
Yes  
Yes! But I prefer the new design in desktop.   
At home mostly on phone, at work i use the website.   
I like Reddit on my computer on the rare occasion that I actually use it, but the thing is my laptop is a piece of crap and so I only use it for schoolwork and do pretty much everything else in my life from my phone, including reddit  
I don't like that fact that if I make comments on my phone they sometimes don't show up on my browser. If I make a comment in browser, it always seems to show up everywhere. Reddit fix this please! Edit: Words  
I finally found my long lost family! :,)  
Yes! I‚Äôm dyslexic and there is too much going on on desktop.   
I prefer computer, but mine was stolen along with most of my other belongings a year and a half ago when I was kidnapped, so now I just use my phone.  
yes. the website looks like crap.  
Until very recently I did. I was very keen to find a way to block people and there is no option whatsoever for me on mobile. I know you‚Äôre supposed to be able to do it from the inbox but I don‚Äôt have the option. I‚Äôve sent people screenshots to prove it and nobody knows what the problem is. Anyway, I finally figured it out. I had to load the old design on a PC and report. I don‚Äôt have a block option anywhere else. Not the desktop site, not the mobile site, and not the old desktop site. The block prompt after reporting is the only way. And even then it doesn‚Äôt work on my phone or my iPad. I can‚Äôt figure out why the block feature doesn‚Äôt load no matter what but it doesn‚Äôt. I read these comments back to myself and it sounds like I‚Äôm a crazy person. It really sounds like I‚Äôm either nuts or I just don‚Äôt know how to click or tap a link but I swear this is true. Like I said, I‚Äôve shown people screenshots. So I have to use the laptop sometimes. It sucks.  
I don‚Äôt even own a computer, so yes.   
Yeah, I do.  
I do as well.  
The way I learned to stand desktop Reddit was using a chrome extension called Hover Zoom that enlarges images when you hover over them. This is so I can see a pic without opening the post. It worked well for a while but then Reddit image hosting became standard on mobile and desktop and for whatever reason hover zoom wont work on images posted using that. I haven't found a plugin that does. Its really annoying  
I use the online as well, but each platform has pros and cons.  
Me too. I use the Reddit is fun app. Works great!  
Yea! Sooo much easier. I only use my laptop on the rare occasion it doesn't work on my phone and even then I wait it out  
I usually browse on my phone, but use my computer if I need to type anything longer than a few lines or submit posts.  
Yeah, now. That redesign is God awful. So much wasted space.  
no way, I refuse to have on my smartphone because Id never look away from it If It was there.   
the lack of a back button really fucks computer site over I feel   
üëãüèª  
Have used Reddit on a desktop maybe twice in 6 years only on my phone ever.    
I only go on the computer if I have a long post/comment I want to write out   
Almost exclusively.  
Me. Only ever used it on phone app and get confused looking at it on a browser.   
Yep. Went on reddit using a computer for the first time last week and got weirded out how far back in time i went.  I prefer the mobile app.   
99.9% of the time. I've used it on the PC like 3 times maybe  
No, I rarely if ever visit reddit on my mobile. I much prefer the desktop.  
Yes.  
I would if I didn't have a job  
Yes. Mostly though because I don‚Äôt own a computer  
yeah i used to, but then i found dark mode on pc... now im hooked on both pc and mobile....i used to use my pc to play games...  
Does reddit even work on other platforms? I have no idea. With that said if I am researching something I use Google and limit searches to only reddit. If I am randomly browsing I only use mobile.  
Pretty much and the new theme doesn‚Äôt render properly so I am scared of it...    
No.  I don't have a smartphone. The last time I stated (neutrally and benignly) that I didn't have a smartphone, I got downvoted.  I don't expect this time to be any different.  
The new desktop version is better in my opinion  
Why would I sit at a computer just to browse reddit? Thats weird to me.  
YEP! Reddit is sort of my night thing so being in bed on my phone makes it easier  
Yes, the app is way better in terms of interface and structure, easier to read and consume media.  
Tbh the desktop version sucks compared to mobile  
Me  
Set up account on PC, browsed for about 5 mins. Man I don't want to sit here. Open app store, Reddit apps, Reddit is fun rest is history.  
Reddit is fun  
RIF Master race.  
I mostly just enjoy how easy and quick collapsing threads are on a smartphone. I hate all the scrolling on desktop.   
As of 2016, over 49% of reddit users are mobile, so no.  
I use my phone as a phone, a camera, and to look at Reddit. I don't even own a computer.  
I've never reddited from a PC. Actually aside from work I rarely use a PC for anything. Phone for interneting, Chromecast for YouTubing or Netflixing, Xbox for gaming. Maybe once a year I'll need to print something from home and I'll dust off my laptop.  
I would ‚Äì if it was be possible to use the Reddit app in horizontal mode on my Android tablet. Using the app on a 10" screen vertically simple does not work for me. That's why I usually use Reddit on my computer.  
I tried to get on it on the computer for the first time recently to show someone something and couldn't figure out what was going on or where anything was. The website it horrific.  
Damn skippy.  I've literally never been on Reddit via browser.  I use the "Reddit Is Fun" app.  Black layout.  
I don't have a computer or have wireless internet in my rural house, so I rely on my unlimited data plan smartphone for all my internet browsing.   
Mostly due to the fact that I can‚Äôt remember my password   
There is a baconreddit on my PC?  
Baconreader on my Android. I've never seen it on any other way.  
"Reddit is fun" baby  
Since the redesign, yeah.  If I ever have to stop using Reddit is fun, I'll stop using Reddit for sure.   
Yep, I only use Reddit on the computer sometimes when making posts. Other than that it‚Äôs 99% mobile  
Well, until a couple of days because the new site is actually banging!  
Didn‚Äôt know it was accessible on the computer  
Pretty much. Except for the odd time I happen to be on the computer and bored. I prefer it on my phone.  
I thought that was the only to use reddit.  Unless you got a desk job  
Yes. I only use the mobile app.  
Never been to the reddit desktop version.   
The only time I go on desktop is when I‚Äôm looking for new subs. Mobile doesn‚Äôt show you nearly enough.   
Me! Alien Blue!... rip I just got an iPhone X today... getting used to Apollo now   
YEEEEES. The desktop version of Reddit is atrocious to look at compared to the mobile version (I'm sure some people will disagree).  Although the desktop version is faaaaar less buggy than the app. That's for sure. Lol  
Relay Pro ftw  
Yeah I do I hate the computer one. Mobile for life  
Am I the only one who loves the new PC redesign? It makes it more like on my phone haha  
Reddit on a computer is not very nice looking or user friendly. It would never occur to me to use it on anything but my iPhone.   
Yes! I've logged on to Reddit on my computer three or four times max.  
Yes it‚Äôs so accessible   
I prefer desktop.   
Late reply, but yup! I very very rarely use Reddit on desktop  
Yup, only use computer when I happen to be on one or I need to find a specific post.  
Yes! I love doing that. It happens on my phone and on my work computer. I like seeing what the results are when it unfreezes because I want to see if I could type everything correctly without being able to see it in real time.   
My phone is so old that it often freezes and then blurts out random duplicates of the last few words or the last few words or sentences sentences.   
I see what your phone did there  
üëâüòéüëâ zoop zoop  
I gonna go get the papers  
-Get the papers   
"Oh so you're gonna be a bitch and freeze? Well fuck you I don't even need you" my thoughts as I continue typing   
I miss a typo there botch  
I make it a little challenge to myself to continue typing as fast as I can and then find out if I made any spelling errors once it unfreezes.  
Yes but half the time it‚Äôs REALLY FROZEN and only registers the last few characters. üôÑ drives me nuts   
I do this as a passive aggressive way of letting out my furstration  
YES, it‚Äôs intensely satisfying.  
You feel like Hillary duff when she's typing anything in on her computer in Lizzy Mcguire.   
Now that's an outdated reference, Jesus Christ   
Hillary Duff reference ... 90's babies represent!    
Everyday I‚Äôm buffering ...  
My life itself is a buffering...  
Yes  
That never happens to me.  
Oddly, inexplicably and immensely satisfying.  
I have never experienced that my keyboard freezes. Is this a common thing?  
Everyday at work. Our email SUCKS!!!!  
Found the Lotus Notes user.  
Yup! Happens all the time at work. For some odd reason, whenever it "catches up" it never registers the spaces.  
Guilty. I hate how sometimes the flow of thoughts gets interrupted. To avoid that, I still type and just wait for the words to appear. Could go either way, though. Sometimes it appears, but at times, you really have to exit and type all over again, and that's frustrating.   
Yes and it‚Äôs getting worst   
YES. my computer ain't the best so that happens sometimes. It's like freezing time, doing something and continuing time.  
Yeah  
Yes, but I hate it.  It makes my heart pound when they sloooooowly appear.  
I do sometimes!!  
.  
I learned to do this when connected to a mainframe with a dial-up modem years ago, I would "stack" commands, keep typing and actually try to get as much done like this and, while my work was being done, I could go get a cup of coffee or something. I still do this, hardly even think about it but I find when I clear cache things speed up a bit.  
No, because every time I've tried that, i make a typo and end up having to backspace and retype the whole thing. I have to be able to see as i type.   
Thank god someone said something!  
omg i love that sooooo much!! and its interesting to see, if you got any mistakes...  
Yep! I do that all the time!  
That's one of my favorite things.  
I even hit send   
When I open chrome 8t takes a  ouple of seconds for any image to appear. I can, however, interact with it as I normally would. So i place my mouse on the search bar and start typing before it even loads. Seeing in eventually turn on and type everything at lightspeed is amazingly satisfying  
www.10fastfingers.com   
Yup that's why I keep my crappy Samsung duos with me  
Yes! I am officially wizard when that happens  
Why does your keyboard freeze?  
Lol yeah   
The keyboard doesn't freeze, the device does. But yeah, it's satisfying  
ohhhhh yes  
Who doesn‚Äôt?  
Yup, and it‚Äôs awesome. Like watching the computer read my mind and finish my sentence  
Y'all got flip phones  
Yup! It‚Äôs pretty neat to watch  
Yes! I used to love that on my iPhone. Then I had to switch to a cheap Samsung.  Now I try not to because it will literally break the keyboard. If it freezes and I get too far ahead, the keyboard will simply drop down and I have to reopen it and begin again. It's infuriating but at least I have sonething, right?   
are you sure you dont need a new keyboard  
"Do you guys not have keyboards?"  
I‚Äôm pretty sure the keyboard itself is not the problem   
i know i was just trying to keep it simple lol  
it's built into the computers memory not the keyboard... its called a typeahead or keyboard buffer  
r/foundtheandroiduser  
r/imaniphoneuser  
r/subsyoufellfor  
Yes super satisfying  
Or I‚Äôll rewind 30 seconds because I didn‚Äôt give my favorite part my all in the dramatic first grab  
I have to restart the whole song when I do this, can‚Äôt pity myself for getting distracted.  
Rookie numbers. Restart the album  
Restart the whole day, as it‚Äôs already been ruined.  
Reset the universe, the Big Bang didn't play out how I wanted it to.  
Allllll the time  
Same  
Yaaasssss  
That feeling of trying to show someone a good song but they're used to hear that self-repeating 15 minute beat loops and they completely ignore the song.  
More often than I want to admit.  
Don't be ashamed. You just want to feel the music. Maybe its your ancestors vibing. They are like "this is mah jam."  
Return To Innocence intensifies  
I hate listening to a song for six minutes to get to the best part, and then my navigator cuts it off right at the best part making me have to restart it.  
I put that bitch on mute years ago  
missing a hook is infinitely worse than missing an exit.  
Aww man I just missed the hook... start over!  
Constantly. I'll also do it if a really emotional part of the song didn't hit me hard enough.  
I literally just did this lol  
All the time üòç  
Yes I rewind it at least 10 times if the song is really good  
I‚Äôll replay the entire song just to listen to my favorite part of the song ü§£  
The build up to the favourite part brings the best feels  
All the time! Sometimes a few times üòÜ  
Definitely  
Especially if I miss a solo.  
Yeppp, or I just repeat it over and over for 30 mins  
What if the song is 30 minutes?  
I will zone out really bad and restart a song a couple of times tbh  
I do this frequently. My best friend always changes the song when there's still about 10 seconds left. I need that last 10 seconds. They tell me the song was over anyway and something inside me dies.  
Yes yes  
All the time, yeah  
One time I was at a house party and people kept interrupting me while I was having a solo dance party to a song that I was wanting to be completely immersed in. I had to restart it so many times that finally after the like, 7th restart, someone from a different room yelled, "NO! NO MORE!!" Lolll so yes. Definitely can relate.  
My personal struggle with this is always with Megalodon by Mastodon. It has multiple little passages that I feel I miss.  
I've been known to play the same song over and over again until I'm done with it.  
Only always  
I always try to start and finish a song all the way through. Otherwise, I feel like it‚Äôs disrespectful to the artwork. It was created to be enjoyed as it is.  
My husband restarts one if he misses his favorite part  
Exhales quickly through nose  ‚Äúhey I do that‚Äù  
Hell yeah. All the time  
If I fuck up a word on accident? Restart. Wrong vibe, loud cars around when my windows are down? Restart.  
Always. I will do that with a certain part of the song if I didn‚Äôt appreciate the verse enough.  
Depending on the song, as a musician, i found that some songs has some little characteristics that i love, but they are so small that you have to hear very concentrated in orfer to listen. I normally restart a song when i couldn't hear one of those details.  
All the time haha  
1 hundo! I'll rewind a whole song to "enjoy it properly". Music is one of the most amazing forms of art we have. To think, people have been making noises for thousands of years. And we have been trying to make more pleasant noises as soon as we discovered melodies. Music is amazing in every way! Of course you should rewind, or play back a song if you want or need that song for your soul. Music is meant to bring out feelings and emotions. Enjoy it all fam. That's what music is about. :)  
Yup. And ESPECIALLY if I‚Äôve said ‚Äòyou gotta hear this song!‚Äô and the person isn‚Äôt reeeeally listening.  
I start this song over constantly because I get distracted and don't take in the full emotional effect of the 2 minute mark. Same with this one at 1:20  
Yessssss, even if I just miss a few seconds without the proper equalizer, I'll rewind, and it's not like I'm an audiophile or anything, I just have spotify on the lowest quality, wavelet and galaxy buds plus..........  
Yessss  
I‚Äôve listened to the song ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so tired‚Äù so many times I never hear the hook anymore like I always tune out by the time it gets the that part and it‚Äôs my favourite part  
Umm yes and wait to exit the car until it‚Äôs done  
Hell fucking yes  
I have to  
And then I get frustrated when I realize I zoned out again... so of course I restart again  
Sometimes I find a song that makes me so happy I tear up and don‚Äôt wanna listen to it for a bit so I don‚Äôt ruin it  
ESPECIALLY when I‚Äôm trying to pretend I‚Äôm in a music video  
Happened to me at my night shift like three times last night lol.  
OMG YES üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  
I usually put it on repeat until I get bored of it.  
Google maps just talked over the drop so i gotta run it back  
I especially do this is I'm trying to show someone the song and they aren't paying enough attention lol  
or sometimes because I want to sing along that one cool part again  
Every single time  
So frequently. Even if I've heard the song 100 times.  
Depends on the length of the song.  
OMG yes. Never thought about that until today  
Nah, it won't be the same, I already listened a part of it, I just forget about it and I am sure I'll find it again (taking in mind I only appreciate songs after I add them to my library and let them play randomly, the same with art). I only rewind if I was actually not listening at all. Not just distracted, but headset off or just my mind completely blank or focused into one thing.  
And then your friend starts talking or you get an ill-timed phone call, and you're just waiting the whole conversation until it ends to right that wrong.  
hell yea  
I do it to avoid the ad.  
Y r s  
As a songwriter, it makes me happy that people do this.  
EVEN IF I MISSED LIP SINGING A SINGLE VERSE  
Absolutely. If I haven't heard a song from beginning to end, I haven't heard it. I confess to OCD on that point! And the same goes whether I am playing an MP3 or whether I am performing it myself (I play the piano and sing as a hobby). If someone interrupts me before I'm finished....when I resume, I restart the song at the beginning. "Partial" songs are just plain unacceptable.  
in the car, in the  gym..yep  
"Aw yea here comes the dr-AW DAMN IT YOUTUBE! WHY DO YOU FEEL LIKE BUFFERING NOW OF ALL PLACES!"  
Or if I'm washing the wrong dish when it starts  
I now demand that everyone reply to me with songs worth repeating over and over. The more embarrassing, the better. üòâ I‚Äôm excited to see what common repeatables are out there!  
Sometimes I restart a song if I'm rolling up on the homies just so they can hear how much the song Slaps üòÇ  
Constantly.  
My wife gets up set because I turn the volume up if she continues to ramble while I'm listening to my music. If she continues I start over. She says she doesn't understand because I've listened to whatever song it maybe 1000 times.  I once left Bob Dylan Desire in the cd player for a year almost. I just could not get enough of it. It still sounds great!  
All the time. whenever I listen to metallica and read the comments on the video I have to rewind because I missed part of the song.  
No. I have never done this. I swear. I havent. I have not. Nope.  
Just happened to me last night. Decided to listen to the new Taylor Swift album.  
How many subs did you post this in  
Stolen post  
Gtfo here I literally thought of this while driving, link me to the "original" post  
https://amp.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse/comments/59pt7s/dae_restart_a_song_because_you_spaced_out_and_and/  
Absolutely, 100% yes, ESPECIALLY if I had been thinking about the song at some point earlier in the day (which happens a lot)  
I do that with loads of things  
I MUST have fan white noise to sleep. If the fan isn't on. I won't be sleeping. I've had a fan break and have to go out in the middle of the night to buy a new fan.   
[deleted]  
Wow, now that I think back on it... I've done this several times when the power goes off.  Weird. o_O  
Same here.    
My girlfriend got up in the middle of the night and turned off the fan. She thought it was going to fall down and turn us in to pink slime. I woke up almost immediately.  Funny thing.. there was no noise when I turned it back on. Edit: Hah, nice username.  
You may find this useful in your day-to-day life. Try it set to pink noise, with oscillation on.  
I'm terrified that this pacific noise will be interrupted by a "BINGGGG" Windows alert sound if I leave my speakers on all night.  
SSSSSsssssooooo disable windows noises, and log out of all your IM services?  
The brown noise on loud almost made me crap my pants...  
i do this too, every night. i have a fan that sits a few feet away from my head that i turn on right before i go to bed. i turn the fan away from me most nights though because it's too cold with the fan blowing on me. but yeah i can't sleep without the white noise the fan gives me.  
Yeah, I keep the fan probably within 3ft of my head. I have it facing me almost all the time though.  
Once when the power went out, I found a spare computer fan, a 9V battery, and some scraps of wire. Hooked that unit up and was finally able to get back to sleep :D  
I approve of your MacGyver fix.  
exactly I need something to drown all the background sound, were all like Daredevil.  
I had a fan once seize up on me right before I was gonna go to bed. I stayed up taking it apart and cleaning it till I got it working. I finished around maybe 4 am. I had class that  morning, worth it!  
Lol I have done this many times. I have a graveyard of fan parts.  
Why not use and/or make a recording?  
Unreliable and overall just not the same.  
Also you can't play arctic explorer in cold nights.  
As weird as it sounds, I do try to imagine myself as an arctic adventurer rolling himself up in his sleeping bag to hunker down for the night.  
I've tried this but it isn't the same. Also I like having the fan blowing in my general direction. If not directly on me.  
I have the same thing with my computer. I've had a PC in my bedroom for so long I can't sleep without it running.  
I feel you. I need the noise also to sleep. when it gets too cold and the blankets dont help, i just set the fan to exhaust and the fan will be blowing outside and i enjoy my blankets and the noise and sleep :)  
Korea doesn't.  
South Korea. The North doesn't have fans.  
You have been banned from /r/pyongyang   
Lol this joke again! Hi friend! See you soon!   
It's hilarious every time!  
Are you serious? Like, did /r/pyongyang actually ban the-knife? I'm really curious.  
[deleted]  
People say that whenever someone says pretty much anything about North Korea, it's a joke. They ban pretty much anyone there.  
I'm curious myself and found this now I understand..  
I'll just leave this here.  
The fuck?  
I thought south korea was not ignorant.  
I came here to make sure this odd bit of trivia I learned from Reddit was here. I was not disappointed.   
Love it. If I had my way I would turn the air down to the 60's so I can snuggle in a quilt, but the fascists at W.I.F.E. keep saying their cold.  
I keep mine on 60, use a fan, and sleep on down, with down pillows, and a faux fur coverlet......No one's house feels as good as mine.  
I want a sleepover  
The down comes from Pacific Coast, and the faux fur coverlets come from Pottery Barn.  
At night, I crank up the AC in the window (because the AC in the house doesn't work in the bedroom for whatever reason) and it takes a few minutes then it's freezing. I cocoon myself and sleep like a baby someone who doesn't wake up every hour shitting themselves.  
Seconded.  
I want the house.  
I want a sleepover too. I have a baby. Three men and a baby. Nothing will be wrong about this. Oh, I bet hi-jinx will ensue.  
Brit here, all this talk of 60 being cold is confusing the hell out of me... 60 Celsius is 140 Fahrenheit, for reference  
I'm in the same boat as you with the tyrants at H.U.S.B.A.N.D.  
H.U.S.B.A.N.D AND W.I.F.E should merge, they clearly hold the same principles  
Yeah, but when they merge, competitors like B.A.B.Y will become distractions.  
And employees at S.E.X. and B.L.O.W.J.O.B. will be laid off in the process.    
their cold what  
..words Just a guess but I can't think of anything else that would work there.  
Hearts. Their cold, cold hearts.  
How can you say your heart?  
nipples?  
heres the other problem with that... Going to sleep in a little cave with the frozen atric blasting down on you (dont tell me in the only one that envisions this....) You gotta wake up in the morning and simplely put  ... it's fucking sucks leaving that warm bubble for that frozen tundra; its made me late for school, work, sports... you name it! I wish there was something that could gradually warm up the room just as im waking up so when i actually NEED to get out of bed and start my day its warm and cumfy.... (which leads me to another story ill lightly touch on only because it seems pretty relevant to my story....Rich ppl what the fuck are you spending your money on cars n huge houses you're never in for??? spend it ALL on your bed room its the ONLY room you own that you really spend time in. That's what I would do.. get some crazy ass heating system that will do what I described above some blankets made by all types of old ladies from around the world and have the BEST SLEEP FUCKING EVER.  
Get a thermostat with a scheduler. Set it to turn the heat off at night, but back on when you get up in the morning. And then off again when you leave. Disclaimer: I had forced warm air heating in my house. This may not work for all heating types.  
Also, you'd get some good rest.   
As a divorced lady who had this issue with her former spouse, that's why I'm sleeping however the fuck I want now.  
Same situation here. AC at 65 and under covers...   
well, helloooo...  
How you doin'?  
shit, I sleep with it around 57 in the room and I still sweat/get hot. :(  
Just wait til she hits menopause and she will join the cold side.  
My boyfriend loves it -I'm the cold girlfriend :)  
I'm in the same situation, stay strong and warm under the covers :)  
If I could keep my house in the 60's all the time I'd be happy.  I'd sleep naked with no sheets as the glorious fans lovingly draped sweet, sweet moving air across my hirsute torso. This got weird.  
A nice cold bed makes me feel like I'm camping albeit for the 2 minutes it takes for my bed to feel hot again  
The W.I.F.E operative in my house hates how the fan is so loud and blows her hair around. I hate her in the summer time. Sometimes in the winter but definitely all summer.  
Not only do I like this. It is necessary.   
It's the only way to sleep.  
It really is. My absolute favorite is in a good mummy-bag in the winter or late-fall when it gets down into the 30's at night, so that it's cold on my nose and cheeks, and the rest of me is toasty-warm inside that bag. Edit: Obviously while sleeping outside. I do not, repeat: Do Not sleep in my bed, without the heat on, in a mummy-bag, though the image of a person doing that strikes me as hilarious.  
I just moved into my own place about 6 months ago and decided I could deal without a fan.  I woke up sweating under lbs of covers for days on end. I bought a fan.  Apparently when I get sleepy I open the bottom covers with my feet and create an air runner to dry and cool me.   
Wind, Sound, a thousand blankets!  
Poetic.  
Judging by the fact that I see this DAE about once a week I'm going to go with yes, other people do like this.    
Personally, I don't like fans. For some reason, the inconsistent streams of air makes me feel a little sick, gives me slight headaches, or makes by body rapidly ping-pong between feeling hot and cold. This effect worsens when the fan pans back and forth.  I'm not sure why this happens.  
So you'd say you aren't a fan of fans?  
What about the Dyson fan that provides a constant steam of air with no buffeting?  
Buy one of those Dyson Airblades maybe?  
As a fan sleeper, getting an Air Multiplier was one of the best decisions I ever made. The Airblade is the hand dryer.  
Completely agree, i have one of the little Air Multiplier and i love sleeping with it on, it provides great whitenoise to sleep too and keeps me cool.  
Try one of these and you'll thank me. No chopping air, it's a finned cylinder that rotates and pushes the air out.. Think of an old-fashioned steamboat. The paddle wheel on the back? Yup. That's what causes the air to flow.  
Nice try Lasko 4904 Space-Saving Pivoting Task Fan salesperson.  
I'm out of work then, because I can't find that sumbitch anywhere.   
I won't tell anyone...  
They dry my contacts out, but if I sleep bare-eyed, I like them.  
You don't take your contacts out for sleepytimes?  If I don't, I wake up with them glued to my eyeballs.  
Also apparently not taking your contacts out can cause you to go blind.   
I have the 30 day ones, but I usually only leave them in for a couple weeks, then wear glasses for a week, and then switch back to contacts.  
I need the sound.   
I need some sort of sound too.  Can't sleep in complete silence.  But I also keep the air conditioner on late into November.  I can't sleep in a warm room and need it cool.  even if I'm buried under several blankets, I need to be able to uncover and cool off when needed. this, of course, pisses off my girlfriend.  she needs it oppressively warm in the room.  so she has to keep an electric blanket or heating pad on through the winter (because I turn the heat way down).  needless to say, we both have different sets of covers.  I'm usually under a sheet and a fleece blanket when needed but she has a thick down comforter, blanket(s), and heating pad or blanket.  
I will say, a heating blanket cut my heating bill in half last winter but it has to be pretty cold for me to use that sucker.  Under 40f where I'm sleeping at least.  
Absolutely.  Fan's gotta be on my side of the bed so my body blocks it for my wife, and, VERY importantly, I have to have one foot out from under the covers.  Not sure why; maybe it's my heat sync.  
While I am guilty of this and absolutely love it. This has to be a behavior limited to Americans.   
Australian here, confirming my wife can't sleep without a fan + duck feather blanket + one foot uncovered.  
Filipino here and I do this too. Airconditioning on, snuggled up in a comforter with a little gap just big enough for air to get through and circulate the air under the comforter.   
American here.  I do the same thing.  I turn the fan on, snuggle in a nice blanket, and leave one foot uncovered.  It's something I've done since I was a wee lad.   While I'm not sure why you would like to hear this, odds are you won't, I just felt that I should let you know that your wife doesn't do something completely unheard of.  Anywho, thanks for the time.  Have a great day.  
[deleted]  
Get a White Noise Generator (no pesky fan death either) I love sleeping with a fan all year round but I'm starting to think it may be largely the soothing white noise a fan provides.  
My fans aren't that hardcore, we're only a small band.  
oh fuck yeah, sleep like this every night. even through the winter.   
Brave  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_death  
Personally i believe the South Korean government invented this BS as a reason to save power during the night.  
 burried  Cleveland?  
Yes. It looks like this: http://i.imgur.com/saWKf.jpg  
Every day for the last 20 years.... and when I sleep at a hotel or when I was younger and slept over somewhere, I could NEVER fall asleep.. i'd just lay there and sweat, or be extremely uncomfortable.   
White (or in my case, Brown oscillating) Noise for the win!  
I need the sound and the breeze. Even in the winter, I'll have the ceiling fan and an oscillating fan going in the room. All while under three blankets. At first my wife (then girlfriend) hated it with a passion. Now she is the same way. I plan to pass this on to my daughter once she is no longer a toddler.  
Yes, -15c outside, Window open, Fan blasting, and sleeping under the covers.   
Yes, everyone on this site loves that, also popular is with the AC down and a huge comforter.    
Yep, our apartment stays at 55-57 degrees, i bundle up with 6 blankets and make sure my feet are always covered because that is seriously important. I have to have a fan because i constantly hear ringing and the fan drowns that out and allows for sleepy time to commence. A general rule for me is, my head needs to be colder than my body. So if my feet are warm, my nose has to be ice.  
Not only is the cooling breeze nice, but the white noise created by the fan  knocks me out cold. Best way to sleep imo.  
I cant sleep without the comforting sound of my tower fan and that cool breeze.   
The air circulation around my face is all I really need.  I sleep with the ceiling fan above my bed running every night!  
My boyfriend sleeps like that, normally I don't like a fan on my face when I'm sleeping, but when I'm with him it's nice because the combined body heat gets a little warm. Personally I like having the air conditioner on while huddled under many blankets.  
I figured everyone loved this.  
Yup. I turn the A/C down to 68F. I have a water cooled fan on the side of my bed, the ceiling fan, and a standing fan at the end of the bed.  
I must have some sort of background noise, such as a fan, because I have tinnitus and it's hard to sleep otherwise.  
ITT: First World Problems. Yeah, I do it too.  Can't sleep without me two fans on, one pointed right on me, the other circulating the air.  No matter how hot it gets under that comforter, I needs it.  I needs it bad.  
http://www.brookstone.com/bed-fan-with-wireless-remote  
I prefer to be bundled up in a cold room. My face needs to be cold, but my body needs to be warm. In Duluth, MN, in the coldest days of winter, I would open the window and bundle up in my double thick mink blanket. I frequently ended up with snow on my dresser.  
When I was younger, living in Cedar Falls, IA, I had a bedroom with a skylight. I'd leave it open and wake up with snow on my blanket. Best sleep of my life.   
Not since my girlfriends Korean Dad told me about fan death.    
I have to! Except for half of one leg sticking out from under the covers to increase coolness.  
Hey man, don't go dying on me now, k?  
I'm fan dependant.. unfortunately my gf hates it but she will learn.  
I am lying in bed right now, covered by two large blankets while my fan is blowing at the second highest speed. I think you could say that I feel the same as you.   
Yep, it doesn't matter if it's winter or summer. I need to have the fan blowing. Although I didn't start covering my head with blankets until I started working nights.  
Cant sleep without it. Without the fan there's just a constant ringing noise in my ears, that I just can't block out.  
Every night all year long.   
It is currently 11:34 AM and I am doing that exactly.  
There must be constant noise in my room.  I use a fan every night for almost the past 10 years. Also I'm a weirdo and sleep in a sleeping bag. My wife hates it, but it's almost like a sense of security   
I do that just for the noise.  
I do this every night even in winter.  
I like it cold so that I can curl up burrito-style, but then I wake up in the morning like "fuck its cold what is wrong with me?"  
YUP! I just can't sleep as well without needing to keep warm in covers amidst a cold room  
I do this, but I like to have my feet stick out of the blankets!  
So, it isn't just me!??!?!  I'm showing this to my wife!  
I cannot sleep without a fan blowing on me.  
YOU WILL DIE OF FAN DEATH  
I love the noise of the fan as im sleeping,my boyfriend likes actually feeling the fan,so the fan stays on his side of the bed and i snuggle into him. Blocked by the fan but still enjoying the sounds as i sleep. :)  
Nope, and I don't need a blanket on me, either.  Everyone asks me how I manage to sleep without a blanket all the time when they see me sleeping in the summer with all the windows open and nothing covering my body.  I also seem to be very low priority on the mosquito target list, which is awesome.  Even when I'm sleeping alone, it only takes an incandescent lightbulb to drive insects away from me.  
I find the sound of the fan hides the sound the rats make in my ceiling. Without the sound I'm terrified they'll drop on me like a dropbear Kuala.   
ALL THE FUCKING TIME  
Yes!  It's the only way I can fall asleep.   
I completely misread this.  
I have a fan on the floor by my bed aimed up a little to get some noise and a little breeze and in the summer have that and a fan in the window as well.   
I like the cold for the heavy clothing and blankets, so I do this all the time.  
Absolutely!!!  
FTW!  
I'm actually reading this while under the covers with a fan blowing on me.  
I'm a pretty big fan  
Guilty, checking in.  
only way i can sleep  
I've always wondered if it is because my mother put me outside to nap in the baby buggy, all bundled up. In January. In the snow.  
I'm all- "i LOVE you, fan" ... "fuck you, fan"  
Of course. Open the window tooooo  
Hell yes I do! I usually use the ceiling fan because I'll get too hot underneath my blanket mountain.  
Yes! Everyone thinks I'm crazy because no matter what the weather's like, how hot or cold it is, or whatever, I always sleep with a fan and a down comforter.  
This is an absolute must!!  
And my wife sleeps on the couch because I do.  
slept with a fan since i was 18months old. My Wifey hates it!  
Yes. I need it.  
I am doing this currently.  
Yesss!  
I do not like a fan blowing at me, but I like to sleep in a dark cave with cold temps and a blanket. My bedroom has blackout curtains/drapes and I always turn the temp down (auto) 1 hour before I go to bed.  Fans dry my throat/nose out and make me feel shitty for a couple hours in the morning.   
I Love doing this while browsing reddiy  
That first morning pee is always so depressing by how yellow it is haha  
SO DEPRESSING! haha it‚Äôs like my body challenging me. I usually drink coffee too and then it‚Äôs really on  
üòÇüòÇüòÇ challenge accepted. I always drink a cup of water before coffee and it helps so much!   
Uhm is this a thing for everyone?   
Yes  
Well, shit.  
No, pee.  
It doesn't have to be dark yellow but if you have it it's normal.  
If you don‚Äôt drink enough water yes   
Morning pee will always be yellow because the Urine has been sitting in your bladder all night. Unless you pee in the middle of the night and chug water then your pee will never be clear first thing in the morning.   
For me it's the yellowisher the prouder I am.   
Nooooooo that‚Äôs so bad!!  
A piss discussion! How urinating.   
I don‚Äôt even look in the morning anymore. I don‚Äôt need that kind of negativity in my life.   
Especially if you drank heavily the night before. There were instances where my piss was as gold as an amber ale and it smelled straight up like booze. Shit.  
That‚Äôs not how it works. Your wiener may have smelled like booze if you gave yourself a whisky swirler, though.  
Or the girl had too much too drink, either way.   
That‚Äôs still not how it works  
The problem for me is I only pee 1-2 times a day, so I usually don't pee in the morning. My pee is always the color of hint-of-lemon water, just the way it should be.  
i'm more impressed when i see that bright yellow vitamin pee  
B vitamins almost make it florescent.   
that's exactly what i'm on.   
The first pee after I take mine always makes me so happy.   
Jeez, it's like Shrek's piss.  
That's that highlighter pee  
This girl I was kind of talking to in high school took some medication that turned her pee bright green. She grabbed me in the hallway and pulled me into the bathroom. I thought we might be about to get into some filthy bathroom action, but instead she dragged me in to look at her pee in the toilet.  
uh. happy cake day?  
U/esoteric_enigma has been waiting his whole life for the perfect moment to tell this story   
Yeah, surprisingly I can't fit this story into many conversations  
Ah well that's unexpected I would love to be there just talking about maths or something and just out of the blue you find some way to fit this story in   
r/foundthemobileuser  
Making someone look at your pee is pretty filthy.  
I dunno.  I'd be stoked to see some oddly green pee.  
Well I would have much preferred a titty  
So you got some filthy bathroom action... Technically.  
An old coworker of mine told me that a medication called ‚ÄúNiacin‚Äù did this to him.  
dude... how do you have 225k comment karma? that's crazy haha  
That means you've had more than enough and your body is disposing of the waste  
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs necessarily true, there are other ingredients in there that may effect the color. Also, you don‚Äôt absorb 100% of the vitamin even if you‚Äôre deficient.  
Where can I find vitamin pee?  
Mine was green.   
Mine is green if I take vitamin supplements  
wow. i meant that as a joke. i didnt even know that was possible. Thats a little scary to think about  
My pee was a florescent yellow/green shade when I took biotin. Glad I was warned before I had my first pee because I'm sure I would've been alarmed had i not known that biotin could do that.  
Oh... How are you?  
Oh im all better!  
Ok, Dwight.  
Homer Simpson's will also be green.  
Blue is where it's at.   
Yes, and get frustrated when it's still yellow after like two bottles of water.   
Seems like you may be real dehydrated or eating some funky foods.  
Or kidney failure   
Or you know.. jaundice  
Nah he'd be dead by now.   
That‚Äôs... not good bro  
Maybe you need more electrolytes...  
My pee is rarely clear or a decent yellow color, I forget to drink water always. Also, I had to get my kidneys checked out and had a catheter placed and filled my bladder up (they needed to watch my kidneys function) and I had to pee after obviously and it came out freezing cold because of whatever liquid they put inside me. Cold pee? Now THATS a wild ride.  
[removed]  
Huh that‚Äôs unique   
Drink water  
I always push (red, but I mean go for the mix; why not) beets on the younger generation at family holiday gatherings.  When they're young they're horrified at the fact their poop and pee becomes pigmented.  Even that said, I still (as recently as earlier this month) ate beets, went to have a squirt, and still thought for a second or two that I'd contracted mild death.  tl;dr: Beets have color compounds that emerge in both your #1 and #2 and they are goddamn delicious (EDIT: The beets, not the leftovers, you brutes). You only get your body for so long. Check beets out and have a laugh!  
[removed]  
S C A R Y   
"contracted mild death" lol  
 I diagnose you with death   
How is Moes doing?  
Passing a kidney stone does feel like mild death. Aptly put.  
Yes, I always check.   
mine is pitch black  
We all need to aspire to have that color  
Internal bleeding   
Satan?  
Do you even Rhabdo bro?  
Like does the toilet look like the omen is coming out of it  
It's the only thing I can fucking manage as a 22 year old wannabe adult.   
Cheer if you pee clear!  
Only clicked to find this comment, thanks kitty girl  
my disney college program roommate worked at animal kingdom and on the back of the bathroom stalls sometimes they had charts on how hydrated you should be depending on the color of your pee. since most cast members worked outside, hydration is key in florida!  
urine can be... clear? what sort of coffee or alcohol are you drinking?  
Water...lots of it  
 Anderson Paak   
Before a surgery I had a couple months back, the nurses told me the night before the surgery to drink a TON of water. It‚Äôs definitely strange to piss and to look down to it looking like you didn‚Äôt go at all.  
Not as strange as taking a very foamy, very liquid poo and the bowl is clear.  
omg is that what happens before colonoscopies and stuff?  
Probably other ways to get there, but yeah, the drink they give you beforehand does that.  
Drink water throughout the day with very little other beverages   
It can be but it shouldn‚Äôt be. It‚Äôs a sign of over hydration.   
You‚Äôve never drank enough water to have clear pee?  
I know I drank too much caffeine if my pee is green  
TIL that's what makes my pee green sometimes  
Aquaria does   
Yes.  Thanks for asking. I'm also impressed by my poop being green.  
My pee is rainbow colored but I'm straight, help  
Wait does anyone not check their pee every time?  
Without a doubt.  OBGYN has a little cabinet you place the sample in with your name on it.  If any are in there as I put mine in i mentally make it a competition to see if I win the ‚Äúmost hydrated pregnant lady‚Äù award for that day.   Totally not an award.  But still I feel proud when I win and shame when I don‚Äôt.    
Yes, although I heard recently that if your pee is too clear then you need more electrolytes.   
Urine being clear is one of my pet peeves, because it's not better for you.  Your urine is suppose to be straw colored.  If you're peeing clear then you're stripping nutrients from your body.  
[deleted]  
It's called a liver  
When mine is clear, it usually means I'm drunk.  
I used to work in consttuction and often in bathrooms there was a colour chart that showed different shades of yellow and made hydration recommenedations based on the colour. From almost clear - you're well hydrated, keep it up. to Almost brown - seek medical attention immediately. Used to love doing a colour check while peeing. Looking back I kinda want one at home now. I'll try and find an image of one.  
Not when I‚Äôm checking it every 5 minutes  
Every time  
I use to work in an aluminum foundry and they always were preaching to check your piss color because the presses we worked on were like 136 degrees with 1000 degree aluminum being extruded, and they will dehydrate you quicker than you‚Äôll realize. It‚Äôs stuck with me since then and I still check my piss color.  Actually my gram is in the hospital because of dehydration. That shit is no joke.   
When it's clear, you've had much beer.  The keenest observation of my college experience.   
Clear urine is actually unhealthy. Should be a very light yellow.   
If your pee is completely clear, it may be a sign that you are drinking too much water. In general, if you're drinking so much that your urine looks like water, you probably are drinking more than you need.  
Dark orange after my work day today, and that's fairly common. I have paruresis so I don't go to the bathroom at work, but I also intentionally don't drink much while I'm there (or eat anything either till I get home). Just a few sips of a Capri Sun throughout the day to keep me awake, don't even finish it usually.   
Wait you don't go to the bathroom at all? Do you not have bathroom stalls there?  
Look up paruresis. No I do not go to the bathroom in any public place. I literally am unable to.   
Yes!   
Hell yeah!  
I feel proud to recognize this is a repost.  
that sucks... here i was thinking i had an original thought   
Hardly happens for me, lol.  
[deleted]  
When I was a child my pee was usually green for some reason, but one day I went to the bathroom and my pee was yellow. So I called to my mom "Mom! My pee is yellow!" and she kind of looked at me wired and said "Oh... That's nice hun"  
[deleted]  
Anytime.  
I'm really lucky. Ever since I was a kid, I've always craved water. I just want it all the time, it's the best. There's no drink more satisfying than fresh water to me. I never see the demon stream.   
I drink a lot of water & mine's never clear.  
I usually stay well hydrated but the least few months I suddenly have started drinking less.  
Yes, my dad died of kidney disease, so it's sort of mandatory for me.  
Yes!  
Nah, it makes me happy my kidneys are functioning.  
It's supposed to be clear?....  
No. Its supposed to be a pale straw colour. Clear just means you're drinking more water than you need and the excess being expelled. It's not a bad thing to have clear pee, but a little bit of colour is perfectly fine too.   
Especially after I wake up after polishing off a handle of Tito‚Äôs and it‚Äôs still clear   
100%  
I literally don't drink anything but water, and I drink a fair amount daily and my urine is never clear...? What gives?  
You aren't over hydrated....you're perfect!  
Mine is rainbow. Am I gay?  
I always try to see how clear I can make it. Like if it‚Äôs summertime and I‚Äôm sweating a lot I‚Äôll drink a boatload of water, or eat watermelon. And I‚Äôm always disappointed when I realize I can‚Äôt make my urine completely clear. But I have tried  
mmmm creatinine   
always have ever since evolution in africa  
What colour should it be?  
Light yellow.  Over hydration isn't good.  
That was 25 days ago  
I take this nasty-tasting pond sludge mix of vitamins that makes mine NEON GREEN. It's immensely satisfying to see :D  
Yep. Thank you Army.  
Mine hasn't been clear in years. It could be the alcoholism.   
what if it's red  
I drink enough beer to look at my urine and see all the hydration flowing right out of me.  
Every veteran does  
I drink water just to make sure that my pee is clear  
YES! I used to struggle with alcohol problems and was secretly worried about having continual dark pee in case one of my internal organs had packed it in on the booze cruise.  
Do people actually pay attention to this?  
I do. But for some reason if I‚Äôm like at the movies and have an unhealthy sugary drink like soda or sweet tea and I drink a lot of it my pee comes out clear, that‚Äôs the only time honestly. I pretty much only drink water and milk so it‚Äôs weird because my pee is usually somewhat yellow.   
Asparagus smell or goats cheese smell included.  
I get sad when it‚Äôs yellow   
mike birbiglia has a bit about this! it‚Äôs in his road trip joke  
I get sad when it's clear haha I like the color bc it shows power. Sometimes if it's real dark/bright(?) I'll show it off to everybody in the bathroom at the time. I'm very excited right now because it is partly red which means I might level up soon. Wish me luck! /s Edit: ! not ?  
Always and my kids are trained to check too. It‚Äôs such a simple way to teach a child to know when they need to drink more water.  
Or they could just use their thirst, which is what it‚Äôs for.   
Some people just don't have the thirst gene. I am rarely thirsty even when I know I haven't had any fluids for way too long.   
Do you eat a lot of fruits and vegetables?  
Not enough to fully hydrate myself, thats for sure. I have to carry around a water bottle and know that I should be refilling it at least twice a day. If I make it to lunch without finishing the bottle I chug it and refill.  
Yes. Every single time.   
Especially before a drug test.  
"Pee" and "proud" don't really belong in the same sentence if you're beyond potty-training. Your body has a wonderfully accurate way of determining if you're properly hydrated without having to stare at your pee: Drink when you're thirsty.  
For me, clear urine always means I've drank a lot of alcohol...and they say alcohol dehydrates you... Seriously though,  how is that?  
I think it‚Äôs that your body is evacuating urine it shouldn‚Äôt be, so all that clear pee might be your body throwing away perfectly good hydration  
Yup. Alcohol hinders water retention so instead of reabsorbing water from your nephrons your kidney basically says fuck it and let's it all through. That coupled with excessive drinking is why you have to pee so much when youre getting hammered  
It's a mild diuretic  
That makes a lot of sense too! Keeps me regular üòÅ  
This never made total sense to me. This is totally dependent on how much water is in the toilet bowl to begin with. When I was in Europe, there was just naturally less water in the bowl to start. But American toilets start with more, so of course the same urine will be a different shade of yellow if it‚Äôs more or less diluted!   
If you pee clear, cheer!  
Yeah, and if it's not clear, I get so disappointed that I dilute it just to spite my kidneys.  
r/hydrohomies  
My piss is almost always yellow  
when yours is white  
Every night. Till like 6 am. Nobody bothers me, it's so peaceful.  
me too lol :)  
It's sad because I'm so sleep deprived but it's the best part of my day. I play stardew valley for the whole night to morning just watering crops, milking cows, pure silence except the games music. I get hypnotized at a certain point and can't stop lol. It's a problem  
Had to stop myself playing Stardew Valley last night. Only 1 artifact away from getting the sewer key so I can change my fishing perk. It‚Äôs so addictive, and I love the grinds of the game. Playing Runescape as a child has made me a masochist that enjoys these types of grinds, and it helps to appease my ADHD by setting goals for myself in game.  
Wait, so have you not gotten the skeleton key yet? Because honey, once you have access to the Skull Mines in the desert and the Junimo Cart arcade game at the Stardrop Saloon... Your life is over  
Man, I'm glad you're enjoying the game but PLEASE do future you a massive favour and watch this podcast with a neuroscientist explaining why sleep is so important.  https://youtu.be/pwaWilO_Pig  
Can I wait to watch this until it's super late and I should really just be going to be instead though? Need something to distract me from that boring sleep stuff  
stardew valley is so damn addictive of a game but its my favorite. it brings me so much peace, especially late at night.. idk why!! :)  
Used to do so. Then i hit 39.... All nighters started hurting then, not just for the next day, for a couple days afterwards. Don't push too hard. You'll injure yourself YMMV  
you copied the top post of all time word for word. https://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse/comments/aa18yc/dae_stay_up_too_late_despite_needing_to_sleep/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share  
haha i know and i dont give a fuck  
THIS and op's reasons are why I keep doing this. Despite that, I still get my fill of sleep. But it kinda sucks to wake up too late to enjoy the daylight.  
I used to do this all the time at home, because it was the only time I knew my mum wouldn't come through shouting at me and the only time I could really relax. But now I'm away from home...and I still do it. It's a problem üòÖüòÖüòÖ but I just don't want the day to end yet!!  
 it's so peaceful  can't agree with you more  
It's not that I don't want my freetime to end, I just don't want the next day to begin.  
Yea I've been slipping into this feeling, and I don't like it. I feel like the worst part of my day is the moment I wake up. And I don't even really dislike my job at all, it's perfectly fine! But when I get off work all I want to do is nothing, and keep doing that for as long as possible. The concept of trading sleep to keep doing nothing and avoid starting the next day seems bananas, yet here I am...  
This is me. My job is fine, good even. I‚Äôve been lucky to work from home and nothing has changed for me financially. But I want to do nothing after work and I stay awake way too late doing nothing. And then I‚Äôm tired the next day, and the cycle just repeats. Being alive is exhausting. Lol.  
It's hard for me because my fiancee is a totel extrovert. She's been working from home and I've still been going in to the office since I'm essential. When I get home all she wants to do is catch up and go for walks, all the social stuff she's missed out on all day. And all I want to do is tune out the world. My dad needed me to run a quick errand for him the other day after work and I had to talk myself out of a bubbling rage at the audacity of him to ask me to run a 10 minute errand. I wish I wasn't like this.  
[deleted]  
Fucking exactly.  
Who are you, and what do you want?  
holy shit that's me  
This. Plus lately I'm doing this thing where I do the exact opposite of what I should do for my health. It's fun.  
You can get quite a bit of mileage out of that. Have you tried that thing yet where you don't move for days on end? What a rollercoaster.  
Hey, me too! Like, when I heard that obese people were worse off with coronavirus, I stressed out about being obese and at greater risk. And being stressed makes me eat more, which is making me more obese, and argggh!  
This is worst for me on Sunday nights. I've gotten used to a couple of days not working and just dread the return to work Monday, so I stay up super late.  
I love my fellow adhd‚Äôs.  I‚Äôm 50 and just got diagnosed. You guys talk my language!  
I wrote a song about this :)  ‚ÄúStay, while the sunset rises, while the daytime passes; it‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs okay. Watch, as the stars start shining, as the moon is blinding; it‚Äôs alright, it‚Äôs alright.‚Äù I was getting depressed about procrastinating on homework and just needed to relax as the time passed, even though it made me anxious, it was important to distance myself even if it meant I wouldn‚Äôt get the work done. :)  
Yes! Nobody is asking me for anything. I don‚Äôt have to solve anything.  
Your comment made me realize why I do it but I never could think of the words!   This is it!!!  Thank you for sharing.  :)  
Same here. Thank you.  
Yes! Like I don't have to SHOW UP or "put on a face" for anything üò©üôè  
Literally doing this rn! I‚Äôm currently living with my fam cause of corona and they‚Äôre so loud. The tv is always on, stomping around the house, hovering cause they‚Äôre bored (which I totally get since we can‚Äôt do anything outside the house!) but I just LOVE my quiet me time where I can do whatever in silence and if I want sound, it‚Äôs whatever sound I choose! I wonder if I‚Äôll still do this if I‚Äôm able to live in an apartment on my own  
I feel this! Especially the hovering lmao my siblings are so bad with that  
what do you guys mean by hovering? at first I thought it was a typo for hoovering and you were annoyed at excessive vacuuming  
It‚Äôs when someone (usually a sibling, girlfriend or someone else close) idly follows you around, maybe making small talk, checking out what you‚Äôre up to.. looking over your shoulder, or standing in a doorway. It‚Äôs a boredom thing.  
ohhhhh, I get it now. thanks  
Yes and I‚Äôll never learn.  
Every parent out there.  
Comically I stayed up late to be able to play games without my parents getting on me while playing video games  
Ha ha, did that too, except I was reading books. I guess I was referring more to parents of young children. As much as I love mine, I look forward to their bedtime so I can do my own thing  
I stay up late because I'm depressed...  
Weird. My depression makes me sleep.  
I'm an over thinker.. that keeps you busy...  
This. I stay up late cause I can sleep tomorrow morning for weekends since my family keeps talking in the morning and there is no peace and quiet like late night until 5 am.  
You copied this word-for-word from this sub's top post all time, you karma whoring little bitch.  
Envy üòÇüòÇ  
Doing it literally right now....  
All the time. Even I though I love sleeping, night time is the best time to just listen to music, watch something and enjoy the time with ourselves. Everybody is sleeping and there is no one to disturb you as well. I study at night too for the same reasons and I think times goes a little slower at night.  
Get up early instead. It's hard at first, but it's really great once you're in the swing of it.  
Just woke up, this is too early for me it hurts. Going back to sleep. I don‚Äôt know how you do this üòî  
If you think about it like, "I have to get myself out of bed, then I have to do blah blah, it's going to be terrible, etc." you'll just fall back to sleep. One foot on the floor. Just one foot, the rest of you can stay in bed. Hell, you can fall back to sleep for a while if it strikes you, but leave that foot on the floor. Give that a few days, you're getting there. Next step is to put your phone somewhere out of reach. If you want that phone, you've gotta go get it. No more lying in bed on your phone in the morning.  After you do that habitually, give yourself reasons to get out of bed. "Man, eggs sound good for breakfast," "I should let the dog out," "I should check the news," etc. Once you leave your bedroom, SHUT THE DOOR. If you're dog tired, wait an hour and then go back to bed. Do this until you feel less lethargic and can stomach staying awake for longer periods of time.  Add a task that you'll do every morning, make it habitual. It could be something stupid like looking out a window, taking an inventory of the fridge, etc.  This is about breaking your bad habit (i.e., sleeping in), and you're replacing that with a good habit.  
Damn, you have a good point. Baby steps it is. You definitely called me out on the lying in bed on the phone thing, currently can‚Äôt put it down but I promise I will right now lol. Thanks for the encouragement ma friend  
No problem. I'm up at 5am every morning, alarm or not. The wife and kids are about 3 hours behind me, so I get a good few hours to myself. It helped me get the motivation to go for walks, then runs, then dropped 50ish pounds. It's all about overcoming your own objections.  
Baby Steps put down the phone.  
Sorry, but none of that works. Tried it all over many decades. The urge to get more sleep never goes away. I can have a shower. I can make some coffee. I can even walk to the station and get the train. It doesn't matter. My body and brain are still half-asleep for the first hour after I get up, and the urge to slip back into slumber is overwhelming. Getting up is the hardest thing I do every day. I can slip back into a slumber extremely easily for the first hour, and then after that, it's almost impossible to fall asleep, even the following night. I have never, not once in my entire life, woken up feeling refreshed, or energized. I have only ever felt like I need more sleep. Shoutout to /r/DSPD, they know what I'm talking about.  
I can't fully relax or enjoy my free time when I know I have to go to work later in the day. I can feel each second slipping away as work approaches. That's why I stay up way too late after I get back home. At least then it feels like I'm deciding when to end my leisure on my own terms.  
Ye people want things from you less at 2 in the morning can just game not expect any phone calls or someone knocking on the door or mail  it's great but not for my sleep pattern  
Yes! Nobody wanting anything from me.  It's awesome but then I sleep until noon. I have tried working a graveyard shift but I don't want to be awake to WORK...so there's that...  
Yeah I workes graveyard setting up AV for events and there's such a difference between vibing and playing games and being on your feet working until 3AM  
I just ended up getting a job on graveyard shift üòÖ  
Yeah, it's so peaceful to just chill and do whatever with no interruptions yet the pain of getting up sleep deprived the next day ruins it all  
I stay up late cause of PTSD, but at least I have my cat  
[deleted]  
Literally doing that right now  
It's just so peaceful at night. I'll even wake up early to savor that before the sunrise quiet too.  
So true, but I can't take advantage of it because waking up at 0600 is not in the cards for someone like me clearly.  
Only for the last 40 years or so.   Nothing to see here.  
Yes but only cause I have horrible insomnia üò©  
Hey, I‚Äôm just reading about insomnia right now. Trying a sleep clinic might help. I used to have insomnia but I don‚Äôt any more. I didn‚Äôt go to a sleep clinic or use any sleep aid regularly, but I did make a lot of significant changes. It still flares up from time to time but for the most part I sleep 8-9 hours a night without waking up in my sleep. It takes me less than 5 minutes to get sleepy, and usually about half an hour until I‚Äôm fully asleep.  
My problem is I can‚Äôt seem to turn my thoughts off so I‚Äôll sit up thinking to myself for hours. I think a lot of my insomnia was tied to my mental illnesses. I‚Äôve gotten help and am on meds recently and I‚Äôve noticed my sleeping is much better. It‚Äôs so weird and nice to not have all these thoughts when I try to lay down to sleep üòä not sure if it‚Äôs completely cured though cause I still can go a long time without sleep. I might look into a sleep clinic though at some point if I need to. Thank you for the suggestion! Falling asleep in less than 5 minutes would be amazing. I‚Äôve always been jealous of people that can do that lol  
Yeah mental health was definitely the biggest factor for me. Reducing stress, lots of therapy, lots of meditation, and a very supportive spouse is what did it for me.  
Sorry for the late reply! Glad you‚Äôve been able to get better and have support üòä my husband is doing his best right now to be supportive. So it helps. I‚Äôm not too concerned about the insomnia right now. I want my mental health to get better first. I‚Äôm hoping once that does maybe sleeping will be easier and I won‚Äôt have such bad insomnia!  
I do this all the time because I secretly love reading more than anyone knows. My days are just so busy that I don't have the time to read so I stay up till about 2am just reading silently and i wake up at 5.45 for school, i think it's very unhealthy but atst I'm not ready to let my work take over my life and I'm still trying to find a way I can relax.  
I do this, too! I've spent so much on e-books for my Kindle app on my phone, despite also using Overdrive. I will stay up the entire night to finish a new book, so I try to limit myself to re-reading old favorites. What do you usually read?  
I love fantasy books like Throne of Glass, the mortal instruments etc. or books like a thousand perfect notes, paper towns, 13 reasons why, we are okay and so on and i read on quotev  
I liked the Mortal Instruments series too. You might like City of Brass/the Daevabad trilogy.  
Yes. I have 2 teens (1 is special needs) and because school is essentially over they're going to bed after 11, and I want to have some downtime afterwards.  
Well it's mainly because I work 2nd shift, 5PM-1:30AM, that my sleep schedule is kinda messed up. But I don't mind, it's nice and peaceful.  And even then, I usually wake up around 8-9 in the morning mainly out of habit, hell I could go to sleep at 6 and still wake up at that time, but my body will hate me for it if I stay awake for the rest of the day.  
I do this even without having a job. My body requires 10 hours of sleep a day; and I find myself getting grumpy and defying it on a regular basis because it eats up so much of my free time and takes away precious video game time (At least I bother to get up & walk around now and then like a reasonable-ish adult)  
dude...this is too true for me ( = ~ =") pulled the words outta my brain  
Yes! I treasure my time where I‚Äôve done my work, I‚Äôve prepared for tomorrow, I‚Äôve had dinner and I can just wind down in comfort  
Yep! Nearly every fucking night. üôà  
Staying up too late used to be so incredibly easy for me! I used to do this a lot, (almost all the time) but I'm almost 30 now with heart problems from stress & 12h shift job that takes most of my time. I can no longer stay up too late unless it's maybe once or twice a year. I have in the last month once when I shouldn't have.. only by 45mins give or take.. then my anxiety started & I only got 3 hours of sleep at the end of the night because of it. Ces't la vie!

How are you not absolutely exhausted by like 8pm?  
When your body is too tired to get up but your brain gets a lot done!  
Yes except I get up too early instead of staying up late.  
I do that every single night. Sometimes even push myself to stay up when I‚Äôm clearly dead sleepy and just wanna lay down. It‚Äôs unhealthy but I do it. And if anybody finds a cure to that, let me know. It‚Äôs so peaceful at night and like it‚Äôs my peak time to think and process everything. The best time to introspect and all that jazz.  
I'll be dead tired, basically falling asleep, and I'll still be on my phone in bed. endlessly scrolling  
Fact.  
Every weekend. Welcome to the grind. I am hollow  
All the time. I want my evenings to mean something before I have to get up and go to work the next day. Then I regret it as I sluggishly suffer the following 8 hours until I can go home and do it again.  
I work night shift so staying up late is the only way I have free time after I come home from work.  
That's a mood. Night time and a little bit of the morning is the only time I have for myself.  
Yes! Also procrastinating the next day  
I do mostly because the good shows air so late at night. For example: Billy and Mandy.  
Dear god yes! I spend my whole day doing everyone else‚Äôs crap and I have to stay up late just to get time to do what I want  
Yes. Especially when I have some kind of appointment the next day that I am dreading or it‚Äôs the last day of vacation from work.  
Sometimes yes  
Yup. This and because I don't want to wake up and go to work in the morning. I barely workout during the day, but for some reason, around midnight I have an urge to do a bunch of pushups or a workout. Or even clean. Just do anything but sleep lol  
Exactly  
Every fucking night. Then I‚Äôm wrecked the next day and should go to be early but don‚Äôt. I enjoy having a few hours without the wife and kid  
Many many sunrises!  
This might me the most ‚Äúme‚Äù post I‚Äôve seen on Reddit. I value sleep, but I value my time more.  
Late at night while my parents are asleep is the only time I get to myself, so I have to make the most of it  
Yes. I don‚Äôt want work to win and get my time. Plus if I stay up everyone else leaves me alone.  I can play games or read in peace.  
Yup. Always know I should be bedded by 2300. Always up until at least 0030.  
Yes. I hate that if I work full time and sleep full time, between my commute, exercise, and cooking, all I have left is like 2 hours of free time a day. I stay up an extra 2 because fuck that.  
Yes! I think we‚Äôve all been there  
If I'm into whatever it is I'm doing, I don't stop until I'm dropping with tiredness. Sleeping feels like a waste of time to me.  
WOW THIS IS SO ACCURATE  
As much as possible. I'll even wake myself back up some if I start to doze off. I've always been a night person with mild insomnia anyways so it's not too difficult.  
This is the reason I fell asleep at work yesterday  
I'm doing it now  
Yes! I stay awake until 2 or 3 a.m. most nights. I love my alone time after my wife goes to bed. I feel free to do whatever I want (as long as I do so quiet enough so as to not wake her), even if I'm just watching YouTube videos. Makes it harder to get up with the alarm, but so worth it.  
Yes! I just want to lay in bed, listen to music, read or scroll on my phone. Time always flies faster in the evenings.  
I have had this problem for like 20 years and I wish I could solve it.  
Absolutely. Especially on days I have to work. I know as soon as I go to bed, the day us over, and I have another work day to look forward to.  
Absolutely, all night every night  
DAE do this thing everyone else has done before?  
so thats why i do it  
Yep, I know it's not healthy, but I can't stop it :D  
Just about every day, I stay awake until I can‚Äôt physically keep myself awake anymore.  
Me me me  
Yeah only every single night since I left college and started working. (It‚Äôs been 5 years now, still a trash sleep schedule)  
Yes! I hvae a 7 year old and a 9 month old. The only free time is sometime past 8 or 9 depending on how the baby sleeps. So usually up till 11 to 1am latest and up at 430 to 6 and maybe 7am. So tired all the time but somewhat worth it  
Every single day  
of course.. - unfortunately  
I‚Äôm actually happy being alone by myself having some chill time, now that we don‚Äôt have school that often, I actually got a very healthy lifestyle, but usually when school starts and the people just stress me out, (I got my limits with humans) I start to get numbed up emotionally and get very unhealthy. To be honest I hate pulling all nighters, I feel so uncomfortable after it, so I‚Äôm trying to prevent that unhealthy lifestyle when school starts.  
Totally! Having a toddler during quarantine makes it the only time I‚Äôm truly left on my own.  
Absolutely.  I have a toddler and an infant (6mo).  Husband works over night 12-2am is ME time.  Even if it means I only get 5ish hours of sleep, I need the the to de-stimulate.  My days are filled with constant noise and vigilance for my kids.  Those two hours of quiet refresh me.  
Every night. For the longest time I thought it was only me  
I really thought i was the only one doing and thinking that  
Try making yourself get up early and working out. Itll put an end to that.  
Every flippin night. And every morning I regret it.  
Yup. Even though I'm not working.  
Yes. Especially now that I'm a mother. It's a terrible cycle because I end up too tired the next day.  
YESSS in always stuck on reddit lol  
Every fucking night. Gets me around 4-5h.  
I used to do this literally every single night, but then I learned about sleep health. Also, a shit ton of therapy  
I usually stay up because I'm procrastinating having to deal with nightmares. Staying up probably is part of that, problem, though  
Too often !  
I do this and the counter part to this, which is waking up hours early to do nothing. I am a very tired person. But I like my me time.  
Come hang out at /r/BedBros  
Absolutely  
Yes. I wake up early before work too because I hate the feeling of just wake up, go to work, come home, go to bed, and rinse/repeat until it‚Äôs your weekend. Makes you feel like a robot.  
Yes because we have a ten month old son. He goes to bed around 8 so we stay up until 1-2 in the morning because it‚Äôs our only adult time in the day to wind down or get projects done uninterrupted. Sometimes I‚Äôll even do yard work at midnight with the lights on just because during the day as a stay at home mom between cleaning the house and chasing around my son I don‚Äôt have a moment to breathe. But then I‚Äôm always tired because he wakes up early and I go to bed late.  
LITERALLY MEü•∫I hate itüòî  
This is me every day  
Every single night. Not that I have a job. I just feel the night time is my safe space.  
I did last night. Work was rough today.  
My husband !  
I just don‚Äôt want tomorrow to come, but I always thought the night had something peaceful.  
Just borrowing happiness from tomorrow  
Wow never thought of it this way, but yes i do that all the time!  
Me! It‚Äôs my time away from the kids.  
Yes that is so me. For me 4 hrs of sleep=2 day of free time.  
Yes! I tend to spend a lot of the day thinking about writing or social issues or whatever I'm interested in, but I can't sit down to write until after dinner and showering, by which point it's like 9:30 or 10:00pm, and I have to get in the groove so I don't start writing until 11:00. I don't think I'm as severe a night owl as some of the other commenters, because my body needs like 8 or more hours of sleep, but I know that when I wake up I have to get up, brush teeth, get dressed, get out the door to the bus, and I won't be able to do the leisure activities for many more hours. The coronavirus stay-at-home orders are a godsend for me because I can do more personal hobbies while working from home.  
this is the most accurate thing ever. :(  
MY HUSBAND BLAST IT  
YESSS  
Yesss so often but I also enjoy sleep  
I do this all the time, but it‚Äôs especially problematic because I have to wake up early with my infant son every morning. I just want some me time T.T  
This, this is what being a parent feels like. This or your in bed at 8.  Not a lot of wiggle room in the middle.  
This. Finally put it into words. I feel EXACTLY the same  
absolutely. hence why i am here lmao  
Right this minute, I am running on roughly 15 years of insomnia and sleep deprivation, yet was on Instagram and now Reddit even though it's quarter past midnight and I have to be up for work at 8:30 (i.e. am supposed to be on computer at 8:30, will do breakfast and teeth brushing and all that at some point around 9ish, I can barely even manage to be on time for telecommuting), and I was supposed to be reading and going to bed and ugh, I feel like all I ever do is work, and so little time for anything else, plus I'm out-of state-taking care of my dad this week as he just had major surgery.  
yessir  
I‚Äôm doing it right now.  
All the time!  
Yes but look at it this way, if you go to bed then you can have free time sooner tomorrow.  
try not to, but I never manage to fall asleep  
All the time, real strain on my marriage and my health. I rarely sleep enough.  
Exactly. I never understood why I did this all the time for 5 yrs in High school.  
hmm  
Yes!!!! Back when I worked at a grocery store, my schedule was all over the place. Any time I was scheduled to go into work at like 4pm, I‚Äôd sit anxiously all day waiting for my shift. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt do anything fun beforehand in case I got carried away and missed my shift. I still don‚Äôt understand how some people can go on hikes, shopping trips, etc. and then just waltz into work without problems. My anxiety couldn‚Äôt handle that.  
I have a coworker who goes to the shore before her 5pm shift pretty frequently. For me, that‚Äôs the kind of thing anxiety attacks are made from. I have no clue how she could possibly manage that.   
I mean I work in a shop overlooking the beach so maybe that's different for me.   
For reference I‚Äôm about an hour from the beach where I live.   
Does she simply not sleep? Way back when I worked nights before becoming a truck driver, I would sometimes either forgo entirely or just get very little in order to do things like that. But like,I didn't work a desk job, and pushing through exhaustion is pretty easy, or for my friends and I it was. Can't do that as a truck driver, though.  
after having some bussy streaks, I'd say they schedule a lot of stuff, let go off some, and do what they can, that way you achieve more. If it's something you can't afford to miss, just use the alarm or leave the fun stuff for later and do something useful now.  
That‚Äôs fuckin me right now, work at 4:45 and it‚Äôs currently 3:08, I‚Äôm playing runescape but just can‚Äôt get comfortable knowing I have to go in later .  
I have a mom who is always late. It isn‚Äôt that she is being disrespectful of others time, she just has this anxious drive to get things done and has no idea how to estimate and manage time. She is all over the place and can barely keep her head on straight. I get it because I‚Äôm exactly the same way. However I realize this and so I get super anxious about being on time. So much so that I do exactly what you describe. I sit at home watching the clock for 10 hours because if I do anything else I‚Äôm afraid Ill lose track of time and be late. Now Im struggling to let myself (and my daughter) enjoy life a little even when we have appointments. It‚Äôs silly to get a 1 year old dressed and ready to go three hours early and expect them to sit and do nothing until it‚Äôs time to go.  It‚Äôs a weird balancing act and I‚Äôm not super great at it yet.   
This sounds exactly like why so many people with ADHD have anxiety problems too. After spending their lives constantly being late and losing track of time all the consequences lead to anxiety any time there's a deadline. Plus there's a certain amount of relying on the anxiety for motivation to make up for not being able to do it in a more healthy way.  
Anxiety as motivation is a sign of ADHD? I can relate, also I think you can get addicted to that motivation of doing something last minute like it‚Äôs a super power or something, trying to break that   
Yeah, people with ADHD have a hard time motivating themselves naturally when it comes to things that they aren't interested in so they end up leveraging things like anxiety to make it interesting enough to do it (like procrastinating until it's an emergency). It frequently leads to being an anxiety disorder in itself.  
Yea I can't take later shifts either. I couldn't even imagine people with split ones.  
I used to be like this until I started working an evening job that also happens to start at 4. I ended up getting into a cycle where I'm in bed at about 4 AM and then awake at noon. I figured out that four hours is actually plenty of time to get in at least a couple daily activities before work, especially if I set my clothes out and pack my lunch the night before. Basically I got tired of the feeling you're describing so I just decided to get over it. I alternate: one day I'll go lift weights and swim before work, the next day I'll either practice guitar or work on random personal projects. You'd be surprised what you can get done in four hours if you put your mind to it.  
Hate to comment so late, but I work in a grocery store too and god damn that feeling sucks.  
You just give yourself enough time to get to work after you do fun stuff. It's not hard unless you can't tell time. Can I ask how old you were when you had the grocery store job?  I could understand this coming from someone with no work experience.   
I mean, I was like 16 but I worked there for a while. Time management wasn‚Äôt really the problem...it was just the anxiety of knowing that I had somewhere to be.  
Yep it's why I can't fully enjoy my Sunday evenings because I know that I have to work the next day, it's a real bummer   
Sometimes I can‚Äôt even enjoy Saturday because I know I won‚Äôt enjoy Sunday.  
Next week I have something to do after work Tuesday - Saturday.  Because of that I can't enjoy any of this week.  
Yeah the six hour window after work on Friday is when my happiness/relaxation hits its high. It‚Äôs all downhill from there.  
That‚Äôs me every weekend!   
I‚Äôm really glad I‚Äôm not the only person that does this. I thought it was completely abnormal.   
I used to suffer from this quite heavily in the past. Please, do yourself a favor and get a new job. Since I got a new job this shitty feeling disappeared. It's gone and I'm feeling SO MUCH BETTER.  
i used to be the same way. something that has helped me is setting an alarm on my phone at a time that gives me plenty of time to prepare for whatever event is coming (getting dressed and prepared for work, getting home to receive your package, etc.) and vowing to let myself relax and do other things until the alarm goes off.   
This is what helped me get over this too!  
But then I start getting anxious about relaxing too much before the alarm, so I set an alarm alarm, and then I‚Äôm preparing to go two hours beforehand  
i like your method   
"has important event at 3pm, wakes up at 7am" "set that alarm for 8am" - my brain  
Also used to be like that and I used the same method but I think I‚Äôve either gotten over the anxiety or I just stopped giving a shit about things cause I don‚Äôt set alarms anymore either   
Happy cake day! üç∞  
That‚Äôs a good idea! I‚Äôll try that next time   
My google calendar is my lifesaver, I would waste whole days waiting for an evening shift until I started setting alerts on there, now I know I can enjoy myself until my one hour warning. I put everything in it: work, dinners, appointments, my to do list, bills being due, etc.  
I‚Äôve done just the same thing! Turning on an alarm that gives me enough time to shower, dress and drive to wherever I need to be has allowed me to shift my focus to other things because I know it‚Äôs ‚Äòtaken care of‚Äô  
Yes. For me it‚Äôs a matter of getting too overwhelmed. If too much happens in my day, even things that don‚Äôt require physical effort, I become mentally exhausted. I shut down and can‚Äôt be as effective at whatever I need to be doing such as working or being social, etc. I can only take so much, even if they are positive events.   
I used to work nights, and could not fully enjoy my day because I knew I had to work. For instance, I would not go anywhere that could even potentially make me late, such as drive out for a hike or go to a movie. What if there was a traffic issue? Glad I‚Äôm over it, but it literally took years!   
Teach me   
It‚Äôs not easy, but start with little things. Such as go for a walk around the block, or ride your bike. Then work up to going for coffee or at least getting take out. Close by.  Seriously, it took me forever to just do something outside my home. I would stay home all day doing laundry & chores or just listening to music, convincing myself that if I went anywhere, I would be late or miss work all together. Good luck!   
I used to have to work a swing shift (11am-7pm) and it was the worst ever. I felt like I didn't have time in the morning to do anything and the same at night. I like getting something done early so then you don't have to be under time constraints the rest of the day!  
Absolutely. Almost to the point where I can't get anything done that day.   
Not for something trivial like a package but when I had work or class at night, I'd basically be uncomfortable staring at the clock all day until 5. Even though I'd wake up at like 8am and therefore have like 9 hours to do shit before work, I couldn't enjoy anything. I'd just be dreading work.

Hey, BarkingWilder, just a quick heads-up: suprise is actually spelled surprise. You can remember it by begins with sur-. Have a nice day! The parent commenter can reply with 'delete' to delete this comment.  
Well that wasn‚Äôt a helpful way to remember it at all. ‚ÄúYou can remember how it‚Äôs spelt by remembering the correct spelling‚Äù thanks bot  
Hey, BarkingWilder, just a quick heads-up: spelt is actually spelled spelled. You can remember it by it ends with elled not elt. Have a nice day! The parent commenter can reply with 'delete' to delete this comment.  
Yes all the time. I'm in a bar band and if I have a show at 8:00 at night,  I feel like I can't do anything all day.  
Yeah, absolutely. I've found that I can lessen it if I actually schedule activities before the thing I have to do later. That way I can file it away in my brain, make sure I have enough time for travel, etc. Even if it's just "play video games from 10:00AM to 2:00PM." Then I'd leave one hour for showering, eating, and driving to be at work for 3:00. You can leave more time if you need it, obviously.  
r/meditation !!!   
Not sure why you got downvoted, pal.  I was gonna link to r/anxiety but your sub recommendation is better. Have an upvote.  
thank you! I appreciate that  
Big time. Getting a job with traditional hours has helped a lot.   
I have a final interview for a job in 1 hour. I have spent the last 4 hours in jittery anxiety unable to accomplish anything but also unable to sit and patiently wait. Reddit is keeping me sane.   
I use to be so bad about this. Especially if I had plans with friends I wouldn't do anything else for hours before because I didn't want to ferry caught up doing something and be late. Then would get so frustrated when my people would take last minute when I've been planning but day around our plans!  
I have to make a thesis. It started in December and still I can't enjoy my months till I pass it. Even if I mostly do nothing, I can't enjoy going on walks, cycling, watching movies, etc.  
That‚Äôs how I am during the semester as well. I stay so stressed out that I just can‚Äôt seem to enjoy anything because i know that I have work to do (even if it isn‚Äôt a lot).   
I used to be this way terribly with the work scenario. If I had to work later on even several hours after I wake up it‚Äôs like I sat around anxious till I had to leave for work. I was always shocked when I‚Äôd be out doing things with people and they‚Äôd say that they would need to head to work in an hour or so. I get it.  
Yep. Dealing with it right now.  
I don‚Äôt have to work this week but today ( in 30 minutes ) i have to go to driving school and all afternoon i couldn‚Äôt enjoy because i always thought like : fck i shouldn‚Äôt forget to go to driving school..  
Huh, I'm the other way around for most things. I hated working 9-5, I could never sleep well knowing I had to get up in the morning and was perpetually tired. Then I'd get home & have zero energy to do anything other than slob around watching TV. Now I work nights & I love it. I can sleep as long as I want with no alarms, and still have time to do whatever else I need to do before work. I do hate expecting something though...like if somebody says "I'll be over at 4pm" I'll do as little as possible all day so I'll definitely be ready. I just don't get that feeling with work.  
Yeah, me. When I have to go to sleep, I simply don't want to because I will wake up to go to work, so I spend my after-work time longer by staying awake to like 23.00 and more. I actually hate my job too fucking much.  
I was working at the post office and one day I was ready to leave and they called and said "hey man we're short a truck so you don't need to come in til noon" like it was a good thing- I paced around my house for three hours fighting off a panic attack..  
Yes! My therapist says this is due to my anxiety and depression making me feel overwhelmed by the smallest of things.   
Dude. You totally reminded me I was waiting for a package and I actually forgot about it. Thanks!   
Hahah you‚Äôre welcome  
Yes totally. Not so much the mail part but the having something to do later. I love working a 9-5 job because it would drive me crazy to work night shifts because o would just feel like I had to sit around all day waiting to go in.   
For me, it's phone calls. Especially when I have to ask for something. I'd rather just have casual conversation and not have a formal phone call or ask a favor of anybody.  
Yep! I had a missed call from a friend of my partners (who I'm really not the biggest fan of) on a Friday night once, saying they would give me a call back on the Sunday to organise XYZ. Weekend was effectively ruined because I was anticipating this call that I had zero interest in to organise a social event that I also had zero interest in. By Saturday arvo I effectively handed my partner a ringing phone and got him to get it over with.  A common theme, once my partner and I got together, all his female friends started coming through me to organise stuff. I hate it! I am no more organised than my partner, plus I'm more introverted.  
My typical work schedule is 8am-4:30pm. They‚Äôve implemented a new split shift pilot where employees can work 8-12 in the office then 5-9 from home. It‚Äôs nice to have the middle of your day free but I would never wanna leave knowing I have to work again.  
Just remembering my old 4 pm to midnight schedule gives me anxiety. I now work 6 am to 2 pm and it's wonderful to have a good chunk of the day to move at your own pace.  
Me too! I used to work 4pm-12am and now work 6/7am to 2/3pm. It takes away so much anxiety and stress.   
Yes, I have had this problem for my whole life. My meds have been helpful with it lately, though.  
Finally, someone understands! I tell this to people all the time and they tell me I just have no concept of time. Makes me sad.   
I sure do. I hate having to do something or go somewhere later in the day, which is why I make early morning appointments. I can't enjoy my day unless I do.  
Yes. This is why I‚Äôve stopped making commitments and plans during my weekend. For the most part, it‚Äôs glorious and I‚Äôm happy. On the other hand, I do wish that sometimes I can be able to commit to an action plan and actually have a social life lol.   
I used to work a 3PM - 11PM shift, while it was nice being able to run errands during the daytime, you'd constantly be watching the time to make sure you got home in time to get ready for work. It also sucked heading into work while everybody else was getting home and making plans.  
Yes I hate it! My husband is the total opposite so it‚Äôs nice to see others like me! Lol  
I just liked this post and it went from 999 to 1k likes and I‚Äôm so satisfied. But this post is so me lol   
Yes, I used to do this so often, especially  when my partner asked me to stay indoors until a parcel was delivered and it used to completely crack me up. Felt like such a waste of the day. However now, I have learned a couple of new hobbies that involve staying indoors. Its important to make the most of everyday, even if you can't get outside. Find something to do, something that you wanna learn or maybe a project within the house, so that on the day's you have to stay in doors, you have plenty of tasks you could do and it wont be such a waste anymore.   
I experience this too! One errand can kill a whole weekend.   
Oh my gosh I thought I was the only one  
Yes!!! This is why I hate working at 4:00pm üôàüôàüôà  
I hope new comments will help figure this shit out. So, you do it like... RemindMe!   
Yes that‚Äôs why I switched to first shift. I can‚Äôt handle anything else  
aYesssas and i get anxiety the entire night before i have to do something the next day so i hardly sleep.   
I do this when I make plans with someone. I can‚Äôt fully enjoy my day before I hang out with them because I have anxiety of if they will cancel on me because that‚Äôs usually the normal on me.   
I usually wish that the other person does cancel because I say ‚Äúyes‚Äù to plans because I don‚Äôt want my best friends/family to feel neglected, but with school, work, and other adult nonsense, I‚Äôm mentally and physically tired and need alone time.   
oh my god yes. usually after school I might go out with friends, read a book or work out maybe do my homework but on Tuesdays I have a martial arts class pretty late in the day but when I finish school I do absolutely nothing because if feel to anxious to do anything because I feel I might be late or sommit so I just sit there watching youtube until class starts      
Heck more than a day sometimes especially if work days are in the mix. I can live with waiting over the weekend, but if something exciting is on the weekend, work seems even slower than usual.  
Yes this is why I can't work evenings.  
I love it when I get parcels but when you know it‚Äôs coming on the day then the waiting takes agesssss  
yes.  
totally   
Interesting. I feel the opposite. If I have no plans for a day, I get stressed and think "ugh, what am i doing with my life?" But if I have plans later in the day, i feel better about myself, and I am more relaxed all day.  
100% even if it's a fun outing later. Planned days with my friends suck until we actually go out.  It's like when you would wake up before school and wanted to play some video games and it never felt satisfying with school looming overhead.   
Yes  
Yeah, if I plan to go see a movie in the afternoon or evening or something such as that i feel like I can‚Äôt enjoy the earlier part of my day.   
Not with things like parcels but work, yes. When I did casual shift work I hated doing like 3pm -11pm shifts cos I felt I couldn‚Äôt enjoy or do anything that day. Much prefer getting shit out of the way (be it shifts at work, presentation, job interviews, exams) and relax after.   
Unless it's a super big item like a computer or bed.   
Yes. Knowing I have work later at around say 4pm. Kills my day early   
I can‚Äôt enjoy Friday because I know I‚Äôm only one full day away Sunday and Sunday is the day before Monday.  Don‚Äôt even get me started on Saturday.   
This exactly sums up my day. I do shift work and today I didn't start til 1pm. Because of shift work I sleep like shit so I slept in until 10, then I'm just in kinda limbo waiting until I have to go to work. Worked until 9 and now I have to get up at 5am to start at 6 and work til 7pm. The upside is the days off, but some days are hellish. I hate getting up early, but I'd prefer to get work out of the way so I can relax some nights and not just fret about getting enough sleep to make it through the next day.  
Yes!  For everything!  Lunch dates, doctors appointments, car repairs, banking stuff.  Anything and everything.  When the month begins, I look at my calendar and I breathe a sigh of relief that it looks empty.  As the days go on the month fills and it‚Äôs constant anxiety and I‚Äôm just trying to get through my day so I get through my month, and never truly feel relaxed. Then it‚Äôs all over again the next month.   
I love this subreddit, now I don‚Äôt feel alone in things like this. It‚Äôs why I‚Äôve hated things later in the day because I get anxious and cannot relax until they‚Äôre done. This doesn‚Äôt translate well to my procrastination however...  
I‚Äôm not so much concerned that I‚Äôll be late for work or anything, but I do get these irrational feelings of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point in having fun now, if I‚Äôll be at work later?‚Äù Like the fun is less real or something.   
I read somewhere (don't have source) it can be tied into needing closure. I get the same anxiety and also feel the burning need to resolve conflicts (never go to bed angry) before sleeping.   
Whenever this happens I just try to sleep wherever I am so that I can basically skip the dayüòÇüòÇ  
I get like this when I have plans or an appointment. Even if I have hours of free time prior to the event, I can't settle down.   
I'm totally like this when I have a flight later in the day.  
100%  
YES! I feel like this is why I'm better at sticking to spontaneous plans rather than plans that are made ahead of time.  
YES! If I work in the morning until 2 my day is done at 2, if I start work at 6 I can‚Äôt do anything until I have to get ready.  Then there are those bullshit days where you planned on doing nothing all day and you get called into work and have to cancel your plans üò§  
Yessssss  
I call it ‚Äúhaving the in-betweens‚Äù.  It‚Äôs not time to go yet but I feel kind of paralyzed to do anything in the meantime.  
Yes! Anytime I have a shift at my job or i had band rehearsal/ doctors appointment, I‚Äôm just unable to enjoy my day until its over. I‚Äôm constantly on edge about it even if its Eight hours away and can do whatever I want to occupy my time.  I‚Äôm like this now, my shift starts at 5pm but i havent done anything exciting today because of it.  
Parcel? What are you, 90 years old?  
What‚Äôs wrong with parcel? I‚Äôm British I don‚Äôt say mail.   
I've heard "package" or "letter", but never parcel.  
They do things ‚Äúdiff‚Äôrent‚Äù outside ‚ÄòMurca   
Pardon?  
Heck yea. Sometimes Sometimes, I even cry before that. Or I vomit. It‚Äôs called social anxiety my friend. It‚Äôs very annoying  
Yeah I can relate to that. I haven't been so nervous about calls that I've vomited but I have been that scared before meeting people in person. I am a pretty anxious person in general but sometimes I feel like I'm going overboard. Sorry that you face that it's just really sucky :/  
Oh, I don‚Äôt vomit before calls! I‚Äôm not that nervous either. But when I‚Äôm meeting w friends and even tho it‚Äôs casual, I sometimes vomit. It sucks.  
I don‚Äôt vomit but I get anxiety poops. upside is I feel skinny afterward.  
Yeah seriously!  
How tragic..!!  
You sure about that?  
We sometimes even get enough courage to post  over at /r/socialanxiety  
I‚Äôve actually posted to anxiety, but I never thought about posting on social anxiety. Thx!  
I used to have the vomiting before meet ups so bad (with me it was almost always when I saw the person in question, it only stopped when I felt really comfortable around the person). I worked through it and am so happy now, but I know what it feels like. It sucks, I know. I'm so sorry you're going through it.  
the first time i met my now ex boyfriend, we had been talking for a while and he picked me up in his car. like 15 minutes into our drive i made him pull over and puked on the side of the road. it was soo embarrassing and i told him i was car sick. eventually (meaning once we started dating) i told him that it was actually just because of how nervous and anxious i was. I could‚Äôve told him right when it happened and he would‚Äôve supported me but in the moment i was so ashamed because i barely knew him.  
Thank you! I actually don‚Äôt know many people who go through this. It always get better when I‚Äôm really around people. It happend to me like 3 times when I was anxious the whole time, but normally it‚Äôs okay:)  
is it my fault that i have social anxiety?  
No..!!  
nope, we all human have our preferences and disliking and fears, we shouldn‚Äôt force ourselves to social interactions ist it doesn‚Äôt make us feel better, you just got to accept yourself and try to get yourself better to prevent stress situations.  
Wait if I experience this it's social anxiety???waht help  
Yeah, it started sometime during puberty.. I hate phone calls SO MUCH and I try to avoid video calls at all costs.  
Same, idk what it is but I cannot take phone calls and I'm kinda known for avoiding them :p  
Same. Though with practice of pushing myself, I'm better at it now.  
Yup. I get super anxious anytime I have to call anyone outside of my immediate family. After having a baby, I really struggled with needing to call and schedule all his checkups. It's for his well-being so I muster the courage, but I wish I didn't have to talk myself into it for days before making the call.  
Props to you for taking that step because most people don't get it but it takes a Lot of willpower just to do that.  
Yep sometimes. I hate having call people. Sometimes i just ignorerer when people call me and then after text them unless they say that it takes too long to write down lol.  
Yep absolutely hate it. I took a public speaking class in college for an elective and it is better but still get very nervous for no reason and put it off as long as possible.  
Yes, social anxiety and a phone phobia. When I was a kid I explained this feeling as "the phone is sucking out my soul" but may just be a feeling of not having all the visual queues needed to determine whether or not someone is understanding me/ mocking me. Now my work is trying to force me on phones and I may have a break down. Any advice on how to overcome? (Already highly medicated)  
I think the best thing to do is to make your workplace aware of this situation because you are taking medication for it. If there is some alternative then your work I think would be obligated to provide that.  
I have terrible social anxiety and a phone phobia as well but for some reason with work it falls into a different category. With work you get into a rhythm and calls generally follow a predestined pattern. With work calls you are not representing yourself which I think is where a lot of the anxiety might come from? Kind of like how the question 'tell the group about yourself' is horrifying but 'tell the group about the product' isnt as bad. With work the parameters that the conversation operates in is much narrower, there are much less variables which is another source of anxiety. That's not to say you're voice wont be shaking and tearful for a good percentage of calls but thats okay. I'll give you a visualization technique that I use that is semi-retarded but helps me: i imagine i'm on celebrity apprentice. Idk why it helps but just thinking about sucking up your pride and doing something potentially humiliating for the good of the team and if you fuck up well its only a game. They ALWAYS have to give half complete presentations or make calls unprepared and there are always mistakes. Someone is ALWAYS out of their element and has to wing it. It's always down to the wire. For me it just helps stoke my adaptability.  
This might sound counterintuitive, but try volunteering for a phone bank (for an organization or politician). It's not personal, and you can stay anonymous. The repetition could help desensitize you.  
When you call someone and it goes to voicemail so after the brief wave of relief you nope out of there and hang up before the beep so you can thoroughly plan what you‚Äôre going to say before calling again, and this time they answer and aaaaagh  
AHHHHHH  
The more you do it, the more comfortable you'll get. I still get anxious, but not nearly as anxious as I used to. I'm 20 now. It was the worst when I was 13-16, then I gradually learned how to cope with these situations by being subjected to them, mostly thanks to school. If you believe you can get better it will slowly happen. I've also stopped comparing myself to outgoing people (since I used to wish I was one of them), only comparing myself to my older self. Looking back, I've come so far! :) Maybe you have too, if you think about it.  
Yes you're really right. I've had to push myself a lot to get to where I am now. I still feel anxious about these things but definitely nowhere as bad as it was before  
That's exciting to hear :D  
Yeah and my therapist says it's because I have PTSD and see the world outside my home as unsafe üëåüèª  
I'm sorry to hear that, it sounds like it must be really difficult for you.  
It's not debilitating or anything, but Ive definitely got anxiety. But that's what therapy is for ‚ô°  
Yes for sure and hopefully you are also finding things better after therapy!  
Waiting for that moment the phone actually rings?  Yup, just like toast popping out of the toaster.  
I had two interviews on videocall recently due to the lockdown and half an hour before I was just sitting watching the clock.  
Yes. But a beer helps  
I‚Äôm terrified of phone calls, emails, any sort of correspondence. I rarely answer text messages. I‚Äôve lost friends, work, life changing opportunities because of it.  I did a stint as a lookout observer in a wildfire lookout tower. I would struggle to answer my radio check-ins or report my weather. There are like instant ramifications to not answering a radio call. Gears get set in motion and people get very nervous.  
Hey Wubsk that‚Äôs really hard. Thanks for sharing w us though. The idea of solitude in nature sounded easy enough huh? Then the reality of being required to communicate set in. I‚Äôm curious as to who made those rules and why lookout observers need to radio back anyway. Why can‚Äôt you just submit a log file by email at the end of the day? Is there anything going on out in the middle of a forest that requires live weather updates? The way I see it, just give us introverts a job we actually want. Don‚Äôt tease us w the concept of getting paid for solitude then make us talk to people on radios.  
Thanks, it got a lot easier as it went along.  Most of the towers in my district were a few hours helicopter ride from anywhere else, so there was no internet. There were phones, but the minutes were policed quite strictly.  They used the weather, cloud cover, temperature, cloud cover and type, RH, and rain gauges for calculating daily indices for how fire behaviour would be that day, or how dry forest fuels were getting. It all gets entered every day and crunched in a central computer program. They don‚Äôt like to mid a day. The reports also serve as a bit of a welfare check. When you‚Äôre out there by yourself, things can go bad fast. People have fallen down ladders, been mauled by bears, had accidents with tools. Around ten years back there was a lady who just disappeared. The investigation is still open. When she didn‚Äôt answer her radio, they sent a crew out there to check, and they found her kettle still boiling on the stove. Measures got put into place in response to that, and they take it super seriously if you don‚Äôt answer a radio message.  
Oh wow. That makes a lot of sense. Thank you for sharing that detail. I had no idea about those things. I guess I had this romanticized idea of reading books from the watch towers and being at one w myself. That sounds like a risky job actually. Really cool that you shared this w us and I think others will really appreciate reading your comments.  
Definitely social anxiety. A lot of the people here giving you advice have no idea what they‚Äôre talking about. Seek professional help, anxiety is not just an ‚Äúehh, just pace around until you feel better‚Äù kind of thing. It‚Äôs an actual medical condition.  
For real!! I used to not be able to go anywhere by myself without panicking. I got very good advice from just a few sessions. You don‚Äôt a life long commitment but yes a professional  
Thanks for this! I haven't really gotten professional help for these feelings but I think once lockdown is over I will reach out  
Yes, I do. Sometimes I get anxious enough that I start shaking. It sucks.  
I get this before having to drive somewhere. Like, I could be scheduled for work at 5 and just s t r e s s all day about it.  
Yes and I don't understand why I do. I'm on the phone, I can hang up if I need to, it's not face to face or anything. But I still get so anxious, it's weird. My mom is the same way. We once argued for like an hour just about calling the trash company and then when I called, it went to voice mail which to me is almost as bad as talking to someone. I sound like a child on voice mail messages.  
I find myself constantly trying to plan out the conversation prior to the call. I‚Äôll try to think through the whole conversation and how to respond to some questions a i think up. I recently had to do this for work. Amazingly I still manage to go off from where I planned and made the conversation a little awkward. At least I still got the job!  
Haha congrats on the job! And yes I always plan conversations way ahead. Sometimes I make like a mental flowchart, if they say this I can say this, if they say that i'll say that. It doesn't always works but kinda helps me to feel safer  
Terribly. It‚Äôs easier with some friends, but not so much with others. The worst is at work - I work in an open plan office (well, was in one pre-covid) and calls to clients or suppliers were generally required about once/twice a day. I used to try and avoid this at all costs, ie trying to sort as much as possible out using email, but my boss (who loves just picking up the phone for any old thing) kept saying to me ‚Äújust pick up the phone‚Äù, ‚Äújust give so-and-so a call‚Äù. I just ignored him/made up a plausible excuse as the thought just panicked me. The open plan office just makes it 100x worse as I can‚Äôt help feeling (gotta love social anxiety) everybody around me will be listening on and judging. Agh!!!  
Oh no that seems kinda jarring also, like open plan offices work well for socialization but on the flip side there's just that feeling of less privacy. I need moments to cool down and go from 100 anxious to 10 atleast, so I can see how frustrating it may be for you.  
Yes calls are mentally draining for me and unfortunately my work requires lots of online calls and meetings. I sometimes find myself unable to sleep if I've a call with a partner in the next morning or something. I've never managed to find a solution to this but I think with time you kinda get used to the feeling  
I hate calling no matter who it is or how close I am with that person  
Yup you're not alone!  
Absolutely.  I feel the need to check everything possible before it happens, even if it‚Äôs just with family.  Then, after, I‚Äôm so drained and need to just sit by myself for a while with a cup of tea and not speaking to anyone üòÇ  
Oh yesss haha I feel that too  
My buddy from work got me to go on Xbox chat with him finally (for the first time ever) and I was definitely shaking for at least half of it.  
I‚Äôm usually fine with online chat if we‚Äôre also playing a game. But I have one friend that just wanted to chat on PSN but he didn‚Äôt want to play the game we normally play (Dead By Daylight). So it was just talking and listening to his abrupt reactions to dying in Apex.  
Thats why I never go on online classes ):  
Yep. Makes anxiety go crazy. Always had. Hate phone calls. May be aspie related.. Or who know.  
I don't get anxious, but I find it very annoying. Prior to the lockdown, my family members would just call me on the phone anytime they wanted to. Since the lockdown, my Mum has discovered Zoom, and keeps on scheduling whole family Zoom chats two days in advance. It's driving me up the wall because I'm not a fan of video calling at all; it doesn't feel natural having someone's face that large right in front of me. Plus, in situations where multiple people are trying to talk at once, I tend to stay pretty quiet, because I've never been one who cared to impose my opinion on others. I'm comfortable with what I believe, and I'm not concerned with sharing it with other people. When there's a call with five people, I find I just don't really say that much seeing as only one person can talk at once. What really bugs me about it though, is that now we have set times that we're going to call, it doesn't feel relaxed or natural. It feels like a formal meeting. And as such, it sits in my mind all day that I have to be sat in front of my computer at this time. So on today, what is my day off, I still haven't felt relaxed or free. I'm not sure what was wrong with just calling on the phone every few days. Why do we now have to schedule formal meetings?  
Yeah that's pretty true I also just feel that the occasional call is great for catching up. But i also know (atleast for my life) my friends and family are way more social that I am. Two of them especially need constant connection so this lockdown life is torture for them. So I've felt more obligated to have videocalls with them to give them that source of comfort. In one way I feel alright about it but my nervousness is still there. After lockdown I'm definitely gonna go on a 100day videocall fast. Like goodbye everyone now's my real break time.  
I get the social need, and I'm fine with people calling me. It's the anticipation of the call that bugs me. We don't need to arrange it two days in advance. Just call me when you want to. Anytime. If I'm busy or I don't feel like answering then I won't and I'll call you back later.  
Yes it‚Äôs gotten to the point where I really only like to FaceTime my own mom because I have a baby and I feel like people get frustrated when I have to tend to him and they can see (whereas if I‚Äôm on the phone I mute them and they don‚Äôt know). Especially my aunt. She gets so angry when I don‚Äôt give her my full attention I try to just avoid all phone calls and FaceTime because I‚Äôm trying to help my baby and she‚Äôs in the background saying ‚ÄúIF YOURE BUSY ILL JUST LET YOU GO‚Äù and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúno, I‚Äôm not busy at all, I have to tend to my infant all day everyday just let me do my thing keep talking I can hear you both‚Äù but she gets seemingly jealous and irritated that my child needs his diaper changed... but even FaceTiming my sons physical therapist for his weekly session makes me anxious just from having to talk to someone even though the lady is really awesome and nice. I just like being in my home with my guy, my baby, and my dog and avoiding human interaction but I know that only makes it worse.  
That's kinda rude of your aunt to put that pressure on you. You're totally justified because you're literally looking after your child. And yes to the last part! It resonates so much with me  
Thank you! My girlfriends and mother are very understanding. But my aunt never had children and she doesn‚Äôt get it ü§£  
Omg yes. I literally start coughing. I call it my anxiety cough  
Yes. I rehearse what I'm going to say to my therapist before our sessions  
Just arranged for two in a row. I have two hours to stress.  
Oh dang! Best of luck you're gonna do great  
When my in person college classes switched to online, I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to like it. Thankfully only one of my classes required weekly Zoom meetings. After a couple meetings, I just stopped activating my webcam and muted myself until I was addressed. Gotta say, reading your 1200 word essays in front of a bunch of classmates is super fucking awkward online. Our teacher also separated us into sub-groups to critique our papers together. My partners faces were visible but decided to mute themselves. So basically I can see their faces in awkward silence, while they just text in chat.  Personally, it takes a lot of mental psyching myself up to call someone normally too. I just don‚Äôt like that I can‚Äôt see them in person to guage their reactions (video-calling is weird cause of I have to see my own face and their so close up) but I have some family that gets mad if I don‚Äôt call like once a month. But she can be particularly argumentative about politics, so you have to dance on ice cubes when talking to her. So makes the experience even worse.  
Oh no I can't believe they make y'all read your essays and all on videocall aaah I would feel super weird. And about family getting mad if you don't take a call or so regularly THAT'S SO TRUE. Sorry about the politics arguments tho I can see how that makes it worse and possibly affects each conversation.  
Yes, I hate it. Not with the work-related video calls, strangely, and mostly not with friends, except if something is up, like they broke up with their partner or something. Mostly it's limited to my family.  
Oh gosh!!  I thought I was alone in this feeling.  
Same! Judging by the comments I really feel a little better about it.  
Yeah, it's a funny reaction to have. It's usually because I'm overthinking the social pressures involved instead of just going with the flow. Things work out a lot better if you cut off the overthinking before it gets unhealthy.  
You're absolutely right, it's just that working on all that overthinking is a challenge. But I think once we begin on the route things get better  
Going to a birthday party, even only with a few people who are all friends, I get a terrible feeling in my gut for no reason  
Friend : We should get together someday. Me : huh! yeah yeah yeah sure sure sure Friend : So when should we that? Me : Any day, any time man, why don't you give me a call. Friend : How abo.... Me : ...listen listen I gotta go right now alright  alright, see ya!!  
Exactly this!!! Recently due to the lockdown my friends have been videocalling me WITHOUT WARNING And I had to tell them like just let me know a day in advance aaahh  
So much! My previous therapist was eternally confused about it haha  
Literally always.  
Oh yes.  All the time.  The thing that actually helped me the most was getting a job where I HAD to answer phone calls all day long.  I HATED it at first then eventually got more comfortable with it.  Once I quit that job I backslid and now I'm looking for a receptionist position again. So I'll go through the entire process again.  
That's perfect and I hope you get such a position where you are able to feel comfortable with this feelinf again!  
Thank you! And good luck with tackling your anxiety! You got this!  
Thank youu!  
All the time  
So much so that I developed a toxic relationship with alcohol to cope with it. Have been unlearning that lately...but mostly by avoiding people.  
Ohh that must be tough for you. I'm glad that you are unlearning that and honestly even if you need to avoid people for some time to cope better that's okay. You are allowed to take time to feel better  
Thanks, friend. I really appreciate that.  
I hate video calls with a passion  
yes it‚Äôs so bad that it happens even when i‚Äôm calling my dad. which could partly be because of my hampered relationship with him, but it also stems from the fact that i‚Äôm highly self-conscious about how i do or say things.  so before the call, i‚Äôll be fidgeting and constantly clearing my throat or going through the points i want to talk about - to prevent myself from making a complete fool of myself. i crave those type of calls that some experienced people can make or how they show on scripted media where the person is in full control of his half of the conversation, and handles it well too.  video calls are a rare thing for me, phone calls too somewhat. i feel most comfortable via text so that‚Äôs what i resort to most often. the only drawback of this tendency of mine is that - it gives an impression to others that i‚Äôm clamming up or not wanting to get along much. which can be bad cos then i start feeling lonely :( it‚Äôs a huge trouble i face, but i don‚Äôt know how to resolve it either.  
You're right especially about the part where people get the impression that you don't want to get along much. Even when I don't pick up calls and just remain texting people feel that way about me. I don't blame them but alsk I wish it was easier. Most people here have been echoing the same feeling, but there are some people who took jobs where they had to answer calls all day long. They mentioned that practice helps you to lessen the feeling of anxiousness before a call. It definitely seems worth giving a try to kinda push ourselves into this thing we're so worried about, but I also know that it will be tough to start.  
yeah! i can see it helping us, definitely. the more we expose ourselves to numerous calls, the better we‚Äôll know how to deal with any unprecedented conversations. so at least i‚Äôll have the confidence that i can address matters if they spring up.  
Dude yesterday my friend sent me a vc invite,she was super excited to introduce me to her online friends and when i joined i could't even speak i was so fucking scared lmao,i was and still so disappointed in myslef  
In fact you should be proud that you agreed to the videocall and that too to meet completely new people! Uf you feel that this is nagging on your mind or if you worry about your friend's reaction, do share these feelings with her. I'm sure that if another situation like this arises then she would be more aware and cover up any gaps in the conversation to help you out  
I tend to pace around to help with that, helps keep part of my mind occupied.  It‚Äôs not always the worried part but better than letting roam free in my head.  
That's a pretty good tactic!  
Yes but only because I worked in a call center and every phone call was anticipated to be a customer bitching at you the entire time about their cable bill after refusing all of the offers you give them making things basically free because I wasn‚Äôt the agent they got before. Fuck humanity - I quit because everyday I had anxiety about every single phone call that came through retention.  
That's horrible. I can totally see how such calls would take a toll on someone and fray the nerves over time!  
I can have panic response to speaking or being in a video chat or large conference call/ webinar. I‚Äôve had people suggest playing ping pong with coworkers right up until the start of the meeting or doing dishes or something similar right up until the start time.  Anything other than sitting there listening to the pre meeting silence or beeps. Watching the clock.  
With someone I barely know, kind of, but not with friends. It can get weird from time to time if you don‚Äòt say anything but since it‚Äòs almost always on the pc I can easily find topics to talk about (modtly because we‚Äòre playing on Pc)  
Yes hate it.. i feel like there just judging.. I feel so awkward and lost all my confidence since this lockdown it‚Äôs horrible. I feel I can‚Äôt communicate properly with people so why bother  
I'm sorry to hear that, I can totally see where you are coming from. But honestly remember one thing, don't compare yourself to the people who can do this stuff easily without even a second thought.  If you have time, read the comments here because so many people are finding it tough to communicate properly. If you feel like you want to work on these feelings then definitely do it however you can. Best of luck  
Thanks man appreciate it  
Incredibly yes. So bad that I can't even talk to friends 99% of the time. It's really bad, like beyond reason and I hate it more than anything  
I used to until I started a job last year in tech support and spend my day making and receiving calls now. Instead of getting anxious of making calls I now get sick of making calls outside of work hours  
I literally lost all of my friends because of  this except for my only best friend since childhood... I don't why and how to explain this to people... They seem to think that i just don't want them or i dont care enough... It's the worst  
I'm glad that your best friend stuck by you! Yeah true, people set up all these social obligations and don't even give you space to opt out or connect differently. Like via text I can manage we, but frequent calls and videocalls really shake me up. The friends who have stuck by me so far are able to understand that, but that's happened only after I had to explain myself again and again and again. Ugh  
Yes when it comes to video calls! I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs anxiety (in my case) it‚Äôs just so very unnatural. You shouldn‚Äôt be able to see yourself talking to someone. It‚Äôs very distracting and strange seeing yourself as you‚Äôre conversing with others and I think it inhibits natural responses.  
Yes usually until i vomit  
I feel you on that. I'm 32 and still terrified of talking to anyone on the phone... Besides my family  
Always. I was a receptionist and was anxious for every call  
Ouh! Having it as a job makes it tougher  
Honestly! I really thought it would help the anxiety but nope üòÖ  
I normally get butterflies in my stomach or I kinda sit and look at the screen and hesitate to answer or start it for some reason?  
This is why i drink and smoke pot  
Yeah. If anything is ‚Äúplanned‚Äù i get ready, hair/makeup whole 9 just because I‚Äôm nervous üòÇ  
Haha this! Yess I alsk have to get everything in place and kinda organize things while butterflies are just flying around inside me  
Yes, I had been having a fight with my friend and ( even though it was stopped only 30 minutes in) I had got so nervous I had prepared two different page speeches and last minute I had gotten too nervous to be able to say them, I was so scared in a way, that my voice was wobbling. When I was younger I used to get ( still do, just not as intense) huge anxiety when having to speak in front of people no matter how much I prepare.  
I used to love talking on the phone/FaceTime for hours at a time years ago (high school/early 20‚Äôs). Now at 24, though, I hate it. It just takes so much emotional energy and gives me anxiety to the point where I try to avoid it as much as possible. Even with friends and family. It‚Äôs a weird situation cause I work as a server, and I make my money by being the most extroverted, energetic, and bubbly version of myself.  In the moment it all feels so natural, but as soon as I get home, I feel like all my energy is drained and all I wanna do is be an introvert and talk to nobody except my significant other lol. But I‚Äôve realized that it‚Äôs something I need to get better at and I‚Äôm slowly working on it. Time passes quick and at the end of the day, I don‚Äôt want to regret any missed conversations or interactions with those I love who only have my best interest at heart.  
YES! I teach high school, and I get so anxious being on calls with admin, peers, or students. I finally realized that it‚Äôs OKAY to turn off camera/mic, and I feel great about it now.  
I have a question tho,since everyone is saying this is social anxiety, I‚Äôm starting to think that maybe I have it? Idk, I get extremely nervous when I have to speak in front of people to the point I shake and start sweating , and my heart beats so fast and I have to really focus on breathing in and out so I can calm down  
I'm linking this article here for you to read. It may provide some clarity. But I would say that you should be careful before diagnosing yourself. There are risks to self diagnosing. You may be able to relate to a lot of the things people said in this thread, plus what is written in the previous article so you may or may not have social anxiety disorder. The best way to be sure and get help is to contact a counsellor who can accurately diagnose you. Rn due to COVID there are a lot more text applications to get in touch with mental health professionals. Texting may make you feel less nervous as well, plus the professional can give you a more accurate picture. Hope this helps a bit!  
So sweet! You‚Äôre right tho, I am gonna read the article right now! thank you üíñ  
I am a public speaker, but I hate speaking on the phone.  I avoid phone calls a lot more than what I assume the average person does.  I thought I was weird and alone in this.  Kinda nice to see so many other folks deal with this too. Any suggestions on how to improve? Edit: I don't get so nervous that I vomit.  I just avoid phone calls as much as possible.  
That's exactly why I only text my friends and family  
Fucking hell man I shit myself every time I get a phone call, I love no noise coming from my phone.  
Yes and I cancel them every time and feel so lonely and disconnected but it is all my own fault. So what can ya do üòî  
Totally. But I after forcing myself to call as much as possible, I kinda got over it. I even worked at a call center for a while, that really helped.  Don't avoid calling, the more you do it, the less you'll fear it  
If it is a close friend then I don‚Äôt really care, but I get anxious that my family is eves dropping. I get very anxious if I‚Äôm calling a teacher or restaurant/business.  
Oh yeah, my family also tries to eavesdrop. It's pretty annoying cause then I feel self conscious when on call. How do you manage that feeling of anxiousness then?  
Good to know I‚Äôm not the only one üòÑ to deal with it I will use my heavier headphones and have the volume up higher because it keeps me from whispering and when you speak at a normal volume I find it to be a confidence booster. I also pick and choose what conversations belong over text, if you know what I mean.  
Those are good tips! I don't really have headphones like that but maybe after lockdown I may look into it for my own sanity  
Haha, even if all you have are earbuds I just try to keep the mindset that I am not a child, I can have a conversation as I want üòÇ  
[deleted]  
Yeah texting is sooo chill but getting an invitation for a meeting/call is like double time heartbeat feels. I too have noticed that I relax on the call after about 15 mins or so and that helps a bit  
I used to rehearse every conversation in my head before I started it. Now I only do it sometimes.  
I'm getting more accustomed to it because of this mess. At the beginning of the year, our school had us do an assignment where we needed to do a video conference with 4 other people and discuss a technology topic like AI. It was super stressful. Four months later now though, I'm doing nearly daily video conference classes, and then Discord voice chat calls after that to work on homework. I'm numb to it now.  
Dang! Congrats I'm glad that you're getting more accustomed to it and hopefully you feel the same way when lockdown and all is over!  
I get anxious for zoom meetings üò≠  
So true!  
I don't know why but yeah I do. I do. Completely.  
Strangely if its me calling them its cool. Its when people call me willy nilly for chats when Im trying to concentrate on something, then I try to split focus and fail at both the call and what I was doing. In hindsight telling people to call back later isnt as rude as staying on phone and not listening properly. Would it make you feel a little less uneasy if next time you have a planned phone call coming up, to plan your convo a little more so you know what you wanna get out of the call?  
Yes it does, so far I do plan a little before calls and get myself a little prepared mentally. That does help and makes me feel much safer  
My friend you probably have GAD or SAD  
 DAE have anxiety  Yes  
Absolutely.  
Absolutely, yes. My anxious tendencies kick in and it‚Äôs almost like I forget how to carry a conversation.  
Omfg yessssss, all the time.  
Yup. Over even when I am meeting them in person somewhere  
Ur human.  
I had the same with a guy friend, I always tried to force myself to feel comfortable, because some time we hung out were actually enjoyable, but the more I hung out, the worse it got and the more I lied to myself, I felt like I captured myself in fake emotions I didn‚Äôt want to feel and never want to feel, it‚Äôs like my whole being rejected him and hey that‚Äôs alright, you can‚Äôt control emotions nor who you feel comfortable with, it just happens, when I get that feeling with a person, I know how to prevent it and why I feel like it and stop myself from forcing shit. +I got my limits with socialising with humans I don‚Äôt feel 100% comfortable with.  
Always  
Yes actually, especially recently since we are all in lockdown! I've been doing my music lessons online and I switched to a new teacher cause my other one was moving away a few weeks into lockdown, and she decided that she wants to do ALL lessons over call, and every time I nearly throw up and shake and quite often nearly cry which makes it a lot more difficult to play an instrument lol  
Weirdly not as much on video but much more on phone.  
Me too actually.  I‚Äôm better with seeing someone‚Äôs face.  
Yes! An advice: it disappears quickly with practice. It vanished for me when I started making daily calls because of my job.  
Wow that's awesome!  It makes me feel much better to hear that  
Fortunately no  
DAE do normal things  
I used to work with this girl who would first search for google from her default search engine (which was google).  She would google google.   
We‚Äôre lucky she didn‚Äôt break the internet  
Luckily it's safely stored on the top of Big Ben  
I know this comment is three years old. But I'd just like you to know that, while almost nobody got that reference, I got it, and appreciated it.  
Me too, past friend.  
I occasionally do this when I want to see search suggestions because I don't get them from typing in the address bar.   
Never thought of that. Thank you.  !redditsilver

Nice username, Stormrider. Just finished the trilogy for the umpteenth time.  
I do this just to slightly annoy my boyfriend. When I first click to search for something in front of him and it starts typing in the address bar, I always type ‚Äúgoogle‚Äù. Every time he goes ‚Äúthat‚Äôs... that IS GOOGLE‚Äù. He enjoys teasing me about it and it always ends up making us both laugh so I continue to make the ‚Äúmistake‚Äù.  
My boss opens Google chrome Type Bing.com in the search bar Clicks on bing Types Google in the search bar Types actual search in the search bar She Googles Bing to Bing Google to Google something  
I think I had an anuresm from reading that.   
And then I had an aneurysm from how you spelled aneurysm   
Eh auto correct said it was that so fuck it

I also worked with a girl that did this. I‚Äôm still upset about it and it‚Äôs been 3 years since I‚Äôve even watched it occur. Thanks a lot for the reminder.   
I used to do that, I felt like the default one was phony.  
My dad does that too, it's so painful to watch! More specifically, he types "www.google.com" in the search bar and then continues to search what he needs. I've explained a dozen times that he can search right away but I guess he likes it better that way.   
I work with a retired clientele. I cant tell you how many times a day i have to explain to them the difference between putting our web address in the search bar in google (or ask.com, or yahoo, etc) and putting it in the address bar of the browser. I've gotten really good at recognizing verbal descriptions of what google turns up for search results for my company's website.   
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who this irksüòÇ  
My ex used to do this, it drove me up the fucking wall. Got to a point where she would do it just to screw with me.  
It kills me when someone who is using Chrome feels the need to navigate to google.com and THEN typing their search/question.   
Some. Including me. Do that because it will give you the suggestions based on what you're doing.   
If it‚Äôs tor or something then it makes sense  
Tor doesnt even support google  
Well I guess another browser lol, google use to work with tor though  
Or if the search includes a colon early (like if you're copy-pasting an error). Chrome thinks it's a protocol.  
any browser really  
Bothers me more when someone types out a question on Google and instead of selecting the question when it pops up they continue to type out the entire question anyway. Why? WHY?!   
They're probably not looking at the screen. Some people look at the keyboard when they type. Or they just don't want to pick up their hands and switch to the mouse.  
If only keyboards had arrows...  
Or Tab-keys ...  
You can navigate the suggestions with the arrow keys.  
Yeah, but if you're focused on what you're typing, you might never see the suggestion pop up in the first place.  
I sometimes do this and i don't know why  
I hate it when I see someone type out a whole question when they could have used a short search term.  
I think your hate is misguided.  A lot of times I will google a full question and that exact phrasing will appear on the search results with the answer I‚Äôm looking for.  I think they have optimized the search to handle it well.  
Full questions get more specific results imo.  source: someone who was really good at that Google game   
Is that at all similar to the Wikipedia Game?  
I tried looking for it to just show you but it seems to be gone. It was a game by Google to improve your googling ability we played at one of my classes. You had to search for 3 different obscure hard to find answers to questions and it would time you.   
Exactly. A more detailed question generally gets a more detailed answer.  
Semantic search baby  
I used to be a librarian and watching people not type the full question drives me nuts.  ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I find what I‚Äôm looking for?‚Äù Because the internet is massive and you googled two words.   
What irritates me is when people phrase things as questions that don't need to be. For example, instead of "Michael Scott actor," they will Google "Who played Michael Scott?," or instead of "define macabre," they'll search "what is the definition of macabre?"  
There used to be a game where you Googled two words and the aim was to get one single search result. Not sure if it's still going these days.  
As a bunch of sites were made trying to find these googlewhacks and posting them, all of them now just return a list of sites that strung together every two word combination into a big list  
I hate this, like I just pretend it's a caveman and it's super efficient. Like if I wanna ask  "At what time did Stephen Hawking die" Just do "When Hawking die"  
But the fact that Google can understand those questions now, that's the real genius.  
what is the population of paris, france  
I used to cringe when I'd see people putting in full natural tlanguage sentences, but these days, Google handles them quite well.  
It really does amaze me just how well Google search works.  You search for "l o n g b o y e" and get lots of long boyes (spaced out and as one word), but if you sort the letters alphabetically and search for "b e g l n o o y" you just get a couple sites for "words that start with begl"  
The great thing about Google is you don't even have to worry about correct spelling for your search query. It knows what you are wanting to say.   
I have a friend with severe dyslexia and am amazed at how good Google is at knowing what he means   
Waht od yuo maen?  
Even though search engines handle it well now, I still revert to caveman typing. I.e. instead of "is the earth bigger than uranus" I just type "earth bigger uranus" and get the same, if not better, results. Another example is skipping to the source through the search instead of going to the website first. Instead of going to IMDB and searching boondocks saints I type "boondocks saints imdb". I do this for all websites. Almost no reason to ever go to a website and then find the thing you're looking for. Even works for restaurant menus.  
Thank you. Grammar, as well as prepositions, are irrelevant in Google searches. Nouns, adjective, and sometimes verbs are all it takes  
If you're on chrome you can just do: imdb [tab] boondock saints And you'll search imdb directly. Lots of common search type sites have that tab functionality.  
I love how simple it is to look stuff up. I was ecstatic when 'a guy looking back at a girl' found what I wanted.  
I get frustrated when people are discussing something they don‚Äôt know about, saying ‚Äúhmmm I wonder? Guess we‚Äôll never know!‚Äù, and it‚Äôs something that can be easily googled.  I whip out my phone, quietly google it, and then when I give them the information they were curious about they act like I‚Äôm some kind of wizard.   
Just a heads up. I say that occasionally, it's because I don't care enough to google it. I realize that's very little effort to do, which illustrates how little I care.  
I also hate talking to people who have to constantly fact check every sentence I say on Google as well.  
I do this but it's not about fact checking, it's more curiosity  
I don‚Äôt do it to be a fact checking asshole, it‚Äôs out of curiosity for me too.   
...source?  
Not according to this Facebook you made in 05, you don't.  
I've been had  
This is a joke with my gf and I, one of us will ask a question that comes to mind while using our phones and then go, "well, guess I'll just die not knowing." and shrug.   
Sometimes it‚Äôs OK not to know everything. A little ignorance and wonder can be humbling. It reminds us to not take for granted the access to vast knowledge we have nowadays.  
My fiance drives me batshit with his Google voice searching. He yells his question into the phone using waaay to much irrelevant information and then gets pissed off at his phone like it's the damn phones fault. Smh.   
My dad does this all the time and it pisses everyone off. He will scream out ‚ÄúGOOGLE, TELL ME THE DIRECTIONS TO THE CLOSEST WELLS FARGO THATS OPEN UNTIL 4‚Äù  I get it , google voice is supposed to be more convenient but it would have literally took us a few more seconds to just type it out. Screaming at your phone is just so obnoxious and annoying to me.   
Lol my 8yr old son does this. Drives me nuts. He also says "zombie videos" in the YouTube app. I always tell him that YouTube is all videos!  
Ugh, the people that don't understand the concept of "search terms"  
It‚Äôs also an actual thing; when you watch someone doing something on a computer your brain reacts as if you are doing it yourself and that‚Äôs why it is so frustrating.  Edit: slimy old semicolon.  
I'm a librarian and this is an occupational hazard.  
I know someone who googles a website and then clicks the link to it instead of just going to the website. Like he will type ‚Äúwww.amazon.com‚Äù into the google search bar and then click the link to Amazon.  
Or just technology in general for that matter   
[deleted]  
Yes and you can make sure two things definitely are in it by using AND between the two things. Like, if you want to find articles about wine and beer you type ‚Äòwine AND beer‚Äô. Also works with OR when you want either one of them, not botj.  
There‚Äôs a webcomic about this that I‚Äôm too lazy to find. It was funny.  Just take my word for it.   
Too lazy or not good enough at Google?   
Both?  
Kind of. I hate it when my father googles the exact statement he is trying to prove correct and sees mostly supporting opinions. Opposed to googling the original question and seeing a more even set of answers to get the best one. It‚Äôs basically a google confirmation bias.   
When my dad sends text with voice, he does it in steps: "Send a message."  "Who do you want to message?"  "<Name>."  "What do you want the message to be?"  "<Message>."  "Do you want to send it or change it?"  "Send it please." It's excruciating.  
https://youtu.be/Sr3bWDBWnPE  
i wish more people knew about boolean operators, i was lucky enough that my middle school teachers had the librarian do a quick lesson on it once   
I didn't know that's what they're called.  
Or typing with two fingers  
this is fine on mobile, most use two thumbs to type. But on a keyboard? ugh. I don't have the patience to type at 30wpm  
no way you could type 30wpm with 2 fingers. Your brain surely would have realised more fingers is better by then.  
I type 77wpm with two fingers.  
No you don‚Äôt.  
"Hunt & Peck" typing  
Fuk yes!  
I usually just use a few key words. I tend to find what I'm looking for somewhere on the first page. A friend of mine will type in half an essay of stream-of-conscious words and gets what he's looking for first result. Every. Time.   
Yes, or watching someone do a search using an on screen keyboard using a remote control and repeatedly missing letter in words.  
I hate it when someone is so determined to type out the whole thing they are searching for even though it shows up in the drop-down results.  
"Why is it that when I..."  
Yes my moms google skills infuriate me but for some reason whenever i can‚Äôt find something online, I‚Äôll ask her to find it and she does 100% of the time. Blows my mind  
I had a friend who searched clip art for "nice cars (such as ferraris)" I was like nigga that shit aint gonna work.  
Nah. I get more frustrated by people watching me use Google. Stop looking over my shoulder fuck face.  
This is my dad in a nutshell, everyday of my life is painful.  
My pops uses chrome, but goes to google.com every time to look up something instead of using the URL search bar. I told him about the URL bar a million times.  
Like typing Google on the search bar of Google!!!  
As an IT person one of my biggest (petty) annoyances when dealing with users is when I tell them the exact website address (url) they need to type in but rather than type it into the address bar they go to google and do a search using the full address I just gave them  
Yeah I get frustrated by people writing out full sentences and not using booleans... I get that Siri and stuff can handle full sentences but why? IMO computers have been dumbed down so much in recent years!    
My Grandma, on occasion, gets Facebook and Google mixed up.  
Really grinds my gears.   
It bothers me when people type in entire sentences instead of just a few words. "What is a spider" instead of just "spider". Or "What does "Good Morning" mean in French" instead of just "Good Morning French".   
I do have a few variants of this one: Clicking on first search result (ad) Not using ad blocker Searching in our native language even tho we both can speak English Googling google Searching for hyperspecific questions Clicking on shady websites  
Every.Single.Day.  
Yes  
My mom still types in ‚Äúgoogle.com‚Äù into the URL address bar rather than just typing her question in there. I‚Äôve tried to tell her the easier way, tho all hope is lost lol.  
Im guilty of this hahaha, im so bad at finding the right terms! My friend hates how I google so I just tell her what I want to find and she'll google it for me :')  
There's a term for that, its known as type A personality.   
My bf would! Lol  
Every. Single. Time. !  
As someone with a degree in I.T., yes, ALL THE TIME.  
I have a hard time watching someone else use a computer at all. So frustrating.  
Nah I'm usually pretty happy they decided to google it themselves rather than ask me how to fix something then stand and watch as I google the answer then fix the problem.  
My favourite is when they open the browser, Google Google, then Google the website they wanted to go to, like Facebook for example.  
Yep. But what i hate more is when they are in chrome and they have to go to the google website to start googling. Just put the question in the fucking address bar dipshit!!!  
Ocd-esque. Have to finish what they started. I do it too lol  
All the time, My husband and dad are the worst cuz they are hunt and peck typers. Drives me nuts!!!!  
I‚Äôm a teacher so I watch kids type in the whole question  right after a lesson in keywords. Drives me insane   
I hate it when people search a specific URL that they could have put into the address bar. Then instead of clicking on the correct link, they click on an ad.   
I‚Äôm so bad for this. It‚Äôs almost to the point that I have to turn away because watching somebody else navigate Google is painful for me. In reality I‚Äôm probably an average user but in my head I can definitely do it better than anyone I know.  
r/iamverysmart  
[deleted]  
I think you‚Äôre funny. Take my upvote to bring balance to the karma.   
All the time. It bothers me when I see people type the full sentence of things instead of keeping it short and concise.  
When people treat Google like a damn person. It's a bunch of 0s and 1s in servers.  
My dad exclusively uses voice to text for googling and complete sentences.   
This.

How often do you clean out stuff from your childhood? From this thread it sounds like it keeps happening to you guys.  
The problem is you never actually clean it out, you just spend ages looking at everything and tell yourself you'll do it tomorrow  
LPT, next time you do this, take pictures of all the shit and upload them to your cloud/computer and/or post them on your social media. Then you can just easily look through there if you wanna step down memory lane and throw away most of the shit. I recently did this with most of my artwork from the past 20 years.  
I just relocated a bunch of stuff I had stored at my parent's to a storage unit by my house.  I'm working on it every weekend to try to clear it out, and this post is right on the money.  
I‚Äôm an only child, and my parents kept basically everything I ever made, played with, assigned special meaning to, etc. There are so many closets full of potentially emotional objects that I procrastinate about it for, well...a while.   
Yep! That's why I like Marie Kondo system :D   
I was telling my fiance about this and he thinks I'm weird for doing this as an adult! I especially do this with clothes/clothing items.   
This is why I have such a hard time motivating myself to get rid of stuff/clean up. I know it will be a nostalgia overload.  
Hell I do that when cleaning out disk space on my computer. It's a blast going through old projects and all the pictures that have been saved over the years.  
One of my favorite things to do while cleaning/organizing   
It‚Äôs even harder when you‚Äôre clearing things out with an intent to throw a good chunk of it away! I‚Äôve got multiple boxes now of old file folders of school exercise books and papers of ideas and sketches from when I was a teenager/kid. It‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got left and so it‚Äôs really hard to part with it.  I‚Äôve resolved to scan it all in (there‚Äôs literally thousands of sheets of A4) and back it up in multiple places both locally on hard drives and in more than once place on the cloud.   
Yeah... Now i have ADHD It only game  
I just lost the game?  
That has 0 to do with ADHD  
I am aware  
yep. happens every time. that's why I don't like cleaning up or going through things that are in storage, because then I get all emotional and start wishing how I could relive those moments. *sigh*  
That‚Äôs why the /r/konmari method saves sentimental items as the last thing to clean out.    
All the time! Me: okay I'll just play 5 minutes of Donkey Kong on my old Gameboy Color to see if I remember how to play, then it's straight back to cleaning up. Me 2 hours later: wow, if I just pass 2 more levels I'll be further than I've ever been in this game! I'm so close to beating the boss I better keep going since I'm already on a roll!  
I do this with my room. It‚Äôs full of stuff that I haven‚Äôt looked at in years. Every time I try to clean it, I find a stash of old stuff and take a trip down memory lane.   
Yes and if I stumble across my journals I just spend the entire time reading them  
Every time, I‚Äôll even make a point to just do one bit at a time because I know I‚Äôll end up just looking through things and reminiscing.  
Been there, done that.. It actually helped me with my small depression.  
If you can‚Äôt take it out and appreciate it now and then, then what‚Äôs the point in storing it? If you don‚Äôt flick through the photos and play with the toys why even keep it.   
My whole entire life. I keep a storage unit still for this purpose.  
Big, fat YES! This is why I can‚Äôt get rid of anything.   
Omg! This slowed down my packing up to move!! What should have been packed in one hour would take me 3 lol my husband was not happy when he saw pics of HS bf‚Äôs lol  
Every time   
All the damn time   
Yup, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so hard for me to throw things away  
Falling down a nostalgia hole :(  
Every. Single. Time. And my husband wants to kill me every single time.  I also am oddly sentimental over my clothes and have a hard time with purging my closet.   
You mean there are people who don‚Äôt do that?  
For sure   
Definitely! Ive been reading up on Marie Kondo‚Äôs book about tidying and she suggests putting sentimental items aside until you‚Äôre done and do them last because they are so distracting and open a rabbit hole of anti-progress.   
https://i.imgur.com/VsmvlcP.jpg  
I kinda cry when I look at old photos and thought how happy I was back then  
Yes! Every time. Love it.   
Yup   
Yes! I've always been big on stowing away blocks of time in shoeboxes. I've got a shoebox for high school, University, each serious relationship, friendships, family, vacations, etc. I keep meaning to clean but instead I get caught up in old memories and then time is up!  
Always  
All the time! So many memories come with those old findings ...   
Yes everytime. It takes me forever! Sometimes Ill even keep it 'just in case'... lol  
Yes.  
I did a bit of that. Found a bunch of old movie promo pins, as well as our old dog's collar.  
Every damn time  
When I finally clean out my dresser I think I would like one of those t shirt quilts.   
Happens to me every single time.  
All the time. Might have even cried a time or two.  
Sometimes I look forward to it, just to look at my old Pok√©mon cards  
Yes!  I call it cleaning ADD.  
That‚Äôs my favorite part about deep cleaning!  
The worst is cleaning out an old hard drive and discovering a time when I still downloaded ummm, adult videos....  
Haha yes every time ü¶ä‚ù§Ô∏è  
All the time.  
My kids do every time they clean their rooms. Makes me happy and sad. Sad they have to part with some things but happy they have fond memories.  
Similarly (but much more shrouded in vanity, I guess), for years now I‚Äôve really only used facebook to keep up with bands. I still have a bunch of family and old classmates and such as facebook friends, but I have the band pages I‚Äôm looking for set to show at the top of my feed so I never really notice any other‚Äôs posts, or post anything myself besides occasional concert check-ins or new music or sometimes a picture of my son that he insists the internet must be made aware of. When I get a friend request from an old acquaintance, I‚Äôll often check out their page to see what‚Äôs going on with them lately, but that gets me thinking what they might see if they do the same for me. After seeing just a few of their posts, I‚Äôll pop on over to my own page to see what I‚Äôve posted most recently, then nostalgia takes over and I keep scrolling, reminiscing about my son‚Äôs first trip to Disney World and such. Next thing I know I‚Äôm looking at posts from nearly a decade ago cringing about the kind of things I thought at the time I should share with the public about my spats with my girlfriend or my thoughts on the current political environment üòñ  
I would clean the front room and read every single of my little sisters books before I put them away  
Yes.  Me trying to pack up my garage in prep for a move just this past weekend.   I did more reminiscing than packing.   
DAE breathe air?  Personally I love the stuff.  
No but my bloody adult kids do  
I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:  [/r/u_cake_mclaughlin] DAE get lost in nostalgia while cleaning out storage and then spend the whole time looking at old photos, playing with old toys, etc instead of actually cleaning?  ¬†If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.

There's really no point in doing a deep clean if you can't give yourself this simple pleasure.  
Everytime I try üòÇüòÇ I always tell myself I won't but I do anyway lol  
no so stop procrastinating and get back to work you lazy fuck  
yes! it's like a (somewhat recent) time capsule.  
300000% yes   
Almost every time I‚Äôve moved. I‚Äôll catch myself getting stuck, for a decent chunk of time, going through an old yearbook, pictures or anything of the sort. Then it hits me that I‚Äôve got shit to do and the stuff goes in a box or gets packed away until the next time I move.  
Big Adhd mood  
It's more like, I wish I was dead and could just sleep forever.  After my shower I become normal again.  
The shower is my second trap. I just want to live my whole life in my shower.  
I go all spaghetti in a morning shower, unless I've actually got important things to do I easily go for super hot water and end up extremely relaxed and drowsy.  
[deleted]  
My wife has a footstool that she uses when she shaves her legs...this has become the throne of morning meditation for me lately  
I always thought I was the only one.. no longer will I sit for 20 minutes in the morning wondering if sitting in a hot shower is normal. My morning life has been justified.  
it wakes me up, but if im not careful i can go for an hour without realizing it.  i definitely rationalize not needing a job while im in the shower.  by the time i get back to the bedroom and start getting ready, ive mostly resigned myself that i have to go.  
luckily that train of thought seems to end for you  
hugs  
[HUGGING INTENSIFIES]  
hugged TO DEATH!!! [no more work]  
:( /r/SuicideWatch   
not sure how it is for blacksteyraug, but i've never felt suicidal per se. there's a difference between wishing you were dead and wanting to kill yourself. i don't think about ways to take my own life, but have definitely imagined scenarios where i die in some unavoidable accident. for me, it's just like not wanting to go to work; it's about avoiding responsibility  
Are you serious about it though? Just last night, I was thinking "Maybe if I kill myself, I won't have to do this essay" and then spent like 10 minutes thinking of what would happen if I were to die. But I don't ever plan on killing myself.   
I appreciate the thought, but that forum only seems to make me more depressed. But seriously anything helps.   
I've been there, wet powder in a gun is the only thing that saved me, but if you ever want to talk to someone who really understands, you can pm me here, also my steam name is alexmoney feel free to contact me in any way you wish.   
For me its after my coffee.   
Things I know how to do before coffee:  Nothing Things I know how to do after coffee:  Everything!  
I tried to quit coffee this winter, but I got more depressed. I'll wait till it's nice out. This coooold winter requires coffee!!!! (Cold in several emotional ways, aside from the cooooold tempurature.... BRRR!)  
If I have to be up super early I have to keep a cold beverage and a powerbar or something to shovel into face as soon as the alarm goes off. The cold + flavor blast usually jars me awake.  
I don't become normal again until later that evening.. When I'm back in my bed. Lol  
Our apartment has a leaky shower-window that lets all the cold hellish air of winter in, so the shower is now a nightmare torture fest. I can't even rely on getting out of bed and into the shower to turn me normal.   
Is getting that window fixed out of the question? That doesn't sound too fun.  
We were told our building is "next to get new windows" buuuut from what we hear from other residents, that's kind of a pipe dream. The place makes up for it in being super quiet, very safe, clean, and really affordable. Next year I'm sealing that window off like nobody's business!  
[deleted]  
Thoughts rush through my head as the alarm pounds to the side.  Should I wake up Should I get ready for work  Or should I reach under the mattress Should I find another type of salvation My fingers wriggle between mattress and box spring My palm rests upon inlaid grips. With a yank I have against my temple oblivion My finger shakes as thoughts of those I leave behind floods through mind minds eye Quickly sweet bliss is tucked underneath my mattress With speed peace eludes my grasp My chinos must be around here somewhere  
You have been cleansed of your doubts.   
Came to say the same thing  
Good thing you don't have a high enough level of motivation to kill yourself in the morning!  
This is how I am. The shower always wakes me up for the day.  
Yes. Hell yes. Morning Me cant stand the thought of pulling planes out the hanger for kenyan students to fly into the ground at 4:30am. It just doesnt sit well you know?  i work at a flight school * planes are heavy as fuck when its just you and thick grass  
AMA?  
Is this a suggestion? If so then ask away  
Are you in Kenya?  Are you Kenyan?  Why do they fly into the ground?  Wouldn't that damage the planes?  What kind of planes?  Why is it grass and not tarmac?  
No! Based in South Africa and I'm South African. It was a bit of an exaduration, the Kenyan students we get are the smartest i've ever seen, but they cant fly at all. So usually hard landings and such. We fly piper Warrior 3's and Seminoles (twin engine) and we use grass because tarmac is very expensive to put in and maintain. Also, the exposure to grass vs tarmac is good experience since only 40% (give or take) of runways in Africa are tarmac.  
 into the ground  I'm gonna take a stab at this one, and say it's pilot jargon, not kamikaze missions.  
For interest sake, this is us: http://www.flightacademy.co.za/  
Your job actually sounds awesome :D Is it warm where you live? I just want it to be warm, that would make me happy.  
I actually love my job, I bitch about it far too often. Yes it is warm! It was 34¬∞c this morning! Then sudden thunder storm. I basically help keep things going here, me and two others. The airschool pays us a small salary and lets us fly 4 hours a month for free, its much better than taking out a loan to pay for my licence. So i'm happy to save my parents some money.  Wow, thanks. That helped me rid my bad mood pretty quickly. :D

Parked next to my pet lion  
Not so much quitting, but wondering if I can drum up an excuse to call out. Every single day. "Oooh... my throat tickles a little... maybe I should call out..."   
[deleted]  
I usually compromise. The most I've done is call in sick. I most commonly just take my first morning conference call from home in my underwear.  
[deleted]  
It's equally bad when your SO is retired and is either still up doing as they wish, is just going to bed as you're getting up or is still soundly sleeping. That bastard.  It's also bad then they get up a half an hour before your alarm goes off and they decide it's the perfect time to eat crunchy things in noisy wrappers while still in bed.   
[deleted]  
Why not work to retire together???   
We both work for state government and I started before him so I can retire before him...it's just 'the rules'...we're pretty young too and need to focus on buying a home and stuff first! Who knows what'll happen by the time either of us can even retire. My husband is about to graduate college in a few months and we're not even sure where his career will lead him.   
My mom used to get so annoyed at my dad for this.  He liked listening to Coast to Coast AM after he retired (which is on from 1AM to 5AM) so he would always turn the radio on while he was asleep.  She was a heavy sleeper so she used to sleep through it all the time until my dad's hearing started to fade.  For the last few months before my mom went on EI he would wake her up at least 2 times during the night.   
We should trade.  My wife drinks coffee and I don't.  It leads to her being very intense, when I'm just looking to be left alone.    
Every morning, I just want to set my world on fire and watch it burn.  
Some mornings I just want to set fire to the rain. But thats just because im Adele.  
Some men just want to do that.  
I have done that, several times. I dropped out of school and every single job I had up to now, my early 30s. It starts with that one day I gave in to the thought. I'm not going to get up today. I'm too tired, I don't feel like seeing people, I'll stay in bed. I'm not answering the phone either, tomorrow I'll figure it out. People call sick all the time, I can do that. The next day I'd do it again. I'd be too ashamed to figure it out, everyone would know I was lying and there's no rational way to explain that I "didn't feel like working". Or I'd just be feeling the same way as the day before. The next day I'd do it again. And again. A week later I'd start answering the phone, and eventually to that call about coming to clean my desk up before they dump my stuff on the street, or how my grades were beyond fixing. Spend six months to a couple years unemployed, feeling miserable and immersed in self-inflicted depression, find a job somehow, hang to it for a few months, repeat.  
You've just summarised the last 8 years of my life.   
The joys of depression and anxiety.  
Been there. God have I been there. I've quit two jobs like that. FOR NO REASON. I just literally couldn't drum up enough energy to give a fuck anymore. I've come a long way since then. I'm a much better person and even though I have my bad mornings I just kinda make myself get up anyway and I always feel better afterwards.  
I used to be like that. My excuses were that I "needed to focus on school". Or one job messed up my w-2 so I just quit going. Once I was in a car wreck and didn't bother being responsible enough to call and ask if I could have less hours or try and get rides. I just said "my vehicle is totaled, I don't have a way there anymore". ....Not all false things, I just could have put in tons more effort. I'm more proud of myself now. I just got a job at a restaurant and had training and now the place is just into day 3 of business. People have no idea how our place works, I end up doing other people's jobs because they don't want to ask where pickles or something is, and my feet absolutely kill me by the end of the day. Not to mention I was extremely upset yesterday because of an argument with a family member. I knew I'd wake up puffy-eyed from crying but all I could think about was not giving into my "give up" feeling. I got up, looked like crap, blamed my look on allergies (at least it was legit), and got through work. I am so proud of myself. I'm tired as heck but proud.  
They call that the "Peter Gibbons."  
Check out wordsforthat.com, you wordsmith, you...   
I have the same problem, which for me stems from social anxiety leading to depression. I realised finally that much of the problem is having an unhealthy sleep pattern. If I sleep regularly and give myself at least an hour of light in the morning to "wake up" then it's not nearly so bad. The difference between me and success in life has been the distance from the bed to the floor!  
Is this my alt?   
This is a feeling I'm all too familiar with. I've just barely started to get over it in the past two years, but it's still a struggle. :(  
You and everyone else who does this needs adderall.  Seriously dude, I can relate.  Get on it, try working for your self & exercising. IDK what your into but can you sell it? Then sell it, ebay amazon whatever. Make a web site with your new found attention span. Or learn a trade & work for yourself doing that..  You can do it, you just got to play into yourself. Not everyone is meant to have a structured life style, many need it and thrive in it, others like myself drown in it.. I was you, this is your answer. PM if you have any questions.  
Of course, people like this are more prone to develop addiction to adderall. Source: am like this, became dependent on adderall.   
Exact same here especially with school. Fall behind, reason there's no way I could fix my grades, stay home. Try again a few years later, same thing. This time I've pushed myself to keep going even if I'm behind and fail. May be the first F our C I actually earn. Step in the right direction?  
You've tried counseling/therapy I assume? Have you had a physical in the last year?  
Slowly falling into this cycle. Recently entered that unemployment stage.   
My freshman year of college my alarm went off for my 10:10am French class. I woke up, logged onto my computer, dropped my French class, and went back to bed. And that's why I don't have a minor in French.   
Yes...every morning...but on my days off I end up waking up early and ready to go because in my mind I have limited time for fun and I have to take full advantage of it...AKA drink all day.  
Can we be friends? Drinking friends?  
a/s/l  ;)  http://i.imgur.com/8101dY0.gif  
You just made my day  
Seconded. Except smoking instead of drinking. I wake up at 9 on weekends refreshed and ready to wake n bake and enjoy the fuck out of the days I get to do w/e I want :D  
Yay alcoholism!!!   
I can't remember the quote but Louis CK has a bit where he talks about quitting entire careers because he was too lazy to get up. I feel like this most mornings.  
Yes! I'm 24 and ask myself every morning how the heck am I supposed to do this for the next 40years!  
Yes. Combine it with depression and you DO quit/drop out. And then you don't have to get up anymore. And then nobody wins! Yay! :(  
Are you me? I just dropped out of school   
Go back.  
Don't listen to this guy. save yourself from the crushing debt!  
I got the best of both worlds. I dropped out with crushing debt.  
Do you still have a job? If so, you're still ahead of me.   
I've rationalized skipping class way too many times in my alarm haze. Hell, I've already decided I'm not going to class tomorrow and I haven't even gone to bed yet.   
It gets worse and worse for me every semester.  I remember back in HS, a teacher told us "Don't ever start skipping class, because once you start, it's difficult to stop."  I've discovered exactly how true that is. My first semester of freshman year, I always want to class.  Second semester, gradually started skipping every now and then, discovered I could keep up my grades with extra studying before tests.  Started skipping intensively 2nd year.  Now my grades actually are starting to suffer a little bit from literally skipping class about 75% of the time.  But I can't stop!  It's so easy to skip.  So hard to get up and go.    
A lot of you seem to feel better after showering.  But if I wake up early enough to shower I'd feel even worse.   
Had a sales job that required me to wake up at 5am.  Woke up one morning after staying up late, called my boss and quit. Found another job shortly afterwards. Worth it  
I have lost a job or five due to being overly cranky in the morning  
A job or fifty, all the same.   
Yep.  Just 25 more years to go. Maybe 35.  
Maybe 55  
98 yo. brain in a jar.  I hope they put me next to Nixon.  
Never is there a point in my life where I am more self-deceitful or apathetic then when I just wake up.  Edit: the only other situation that comes close is my battle to quit cigarettes

It doesn't revolve around money, it revolves around goods and services because that's what we use to live. Money is just the intermediary. If we lived in a society that didn't revolve around the production of goods and services, we wouldn't have any goods and services. Virtually all of the things that you like doing involve lots and lots of goods and services. I guess the best answer to your question is therefore "reality".  
Because money money monay.  
Mr. Krabs? Is that you?  
MMONAAYY.  
Mo-nay.  
Much better way of saying it.  
http://www.reddit.com/r/basicincome  
What is this?  
Basic income is basically that everyone makes minimum wage, that the minimum wage is livable, and that you don't actually need to be working to accrue this wage. I'll just hit on some quick points. Where the hell does this money come from? It starts with the abolition of roughly every social program, such as food stamps, welfare, unemployment, social security, etc. Then there's some decent amount of budget re-balancing involved, including spending shifts and tax increases. Aren't you a lazy bum for living off the system? We are rapidly approaching a post-scarcity society, where most, if not all, jobs will be able to be automated. What this means is that society has worked really, really hard for a really, really long time, and we don't, or rather soon won't, actually need folks working jobs they don't like in order to keep themselves and society afloat. There won't be enough jobs to go around, and arbitrarily "creating" new jobs for the sole purpose of getting people jobs is, basic income proponents say, not the way to go about it. So what, I just get paid to sit on my ass all day? Proponents believe we, as people, aren't actually satisfied with sitting around doing "nothing", but some of the things we currently think of as "doing nothing", are actually beneficial to society without being a viable job. Examples include being in a band, creating art, writing, inventing, researching your field of choice, and so on. Even though all of these things are arguably beneficial to society, they earn a disproportionally low amount of money for the vast majority of those who would be interested in pursuing them. I'm sure you've heard this phrase: "Oh gosh, you majored in art/theatre/gender studies/philosophy/history? Good luck paying off those student loan debts." Thing is, even though it's difficult to impossible to make a living with degrees such as these, they can still be beneficial to society. We shouldn't be discouraging people from studying non-STEM topics simply because the market doesn't place emphasis on them. The topic is difficult to grasp, particularly with the extremely strong social stigma placed on not wanting to work for a living, but I've been finding myself enthralled by the idea. Can you imagine doing what you want to do with your life, instead of waiting until you're retired (or never)?  
I'd like to live in that world.   
"Fuck it fuck it I'm not going fuck it" gets up  
That's exactly how I quit my last job.  
"Quit"  
If you feel like shit in the morning you're not sleeping enough. Yeah, this might be the result of a legitimate sleeping disorder, but it might also be the result of staying up too late. I force myself to get ready for bed 9 hours before I've set my alarm. Then I get in bed with all the lights out. No reddit, no TV, just me in a dark room. Sometimes I toss and turn for a few hours, other times I fall right asleep. But either way I'm not stimulating myself. If you're trying to stay busy till all hours, drag yourself to bed when you're about to pass out, and set an alarm for 6 hours later, you're going to hate life when said alarm goes off.   
I think I've read somewhere that you need at least 1 hour away from electric thingies before sleep. I don't do this so I don't know if it works.  I sleep like a baby anyhow.  
Use flux.  
What's a flux?  Capacitor?  
f.lux  I've used it for years and it's free! I used to stay up way too late at night staring at the computer screen, but now I start to get sleepy eyes 2-3 hours after sunset even though I'm still staring at the same computer screen. Although that may also just be the difference between college and post-college, instead of a f.lux infomercial.   
A program that dims and reddens the light your computer screen emits as the sun goes down. Looking into a bright blue light before you try to sleep can interfere with sleepiness/melatonin production so f.lux helps with that.  
For me, I just have to clear out the input buffer somewhere after work, which usually involves 30-40 minutes just staring somewhere, not seeing anything, maybe listening to good music. I'm looking forward to when it's warm again around here so I can just sit on my balcony in the dark with music and a beer.   
I can try to be smart about money, or eating, or how I work or dress, but sleep really remains for me a mystical ritual beyond my control, organized around fear and ignorance. Honestly, I think I'm afraid to be alone with my thoughts, which drift in the dark to fears or regrets that I worry will freak me out and keep me awake; so I read until my eyes close, and wake up feeling like I tricked the spirits once again.   
Just lie down and think about something that is nearly impossible to archive. I like to think about what I will do if I would win a life-changing amount of money. In a lottery or so. Sometimes I would think about what it'll be if I gain superpowers somehow. The power to fly? The power to not die? Just lie there and imagine things. Sleep comes fast that way. Anyway, it works for me.   
See, I wish I could do this. I could in college, but now that I'm working, that means my day is only 15 hours long. If I spend 9 of that actually in the office that only leaves 6 for waking up, getting ready, personal errands, eating, and maybe a little down time.  I sleep about 5 to 6 hours a night. So, I have about three extra hours a day to do things that I would feel like I was robbing myself of if I followed your plan. That's 21 hours a week; almost an entire day every week. Extrapolate that a little further and that's 45 days in a single year that I'm gaining. I feel healthy, I exercise, and I feel like I'm very aware throughout the day even when I don't have my usual two cups of coffee between 8am and 3pm.  Sometimes on the weekend I'll sleep more like seven hours or take a nap, but I just can't imagine sleeping for 9 hours every night.  
I think you're an example of how sometimes a piece of advice can be incredibly helpful for some or even most, but relatively unneeded for others.  
It's not waking up that bothers me, I develop an intense hatred for my alarm clock. I heard someone with my alarm signal as their call signal, it's been many years since I've felt such an intense rage.   
At my last job I used many sick days because I didn't want to wake up. I would always space them out over a few months so it wasn't terribly obvious what I was doing. It doesnt help that I'm naturally nocturnal. Eventually I did quit that job. Now I have a job that let's me come in late. Now I wake up without an alarm, and it makes all the difference. Additionally, I haven't called in tired for months and I have all this vacation built up.  
What kind of job do you have that lets you come in late?!  
I work for a medium size tech firm that lets me set my own hours. This works for me because I have a hard time getting ramped up in early morning and do my best work in the evenings.  
I've quit 2 of my jobs to stay in bed.   
When I used to work jobs I didn't like, or jobs that were easily replace, sure. However, after many years of working hard to get where I am, I want to maintain what I've worked for. I started out making minimum wage, then working a couple near minimum wage jobs to get through college, then a bunch of mediocre jobs post college until I finally got into my career field. Starting at the bottom, I've put in a lot of work, earned a position I like, and am starting to hit certain goals I set a long time ago. It's taken me longer than expected, but the fact that I care about my job, that it's part of my long term plans, and it took a lot of work to get here helps me get up and suck down that first cup of coffee. ...now during some late nights, long weeks, or stressful situations there are times when I start to think I could bail out, but the other factors, combined with experience help to keep me on course. That's another point, is experience. The more you get out of bed in the morning and get to work, the more used to it you get, and the more you learn what motivates and moves you. It damn sure isn't always easy, but you do learn to control and motivate yourself better. The longer ahead you're looking, the easier it gets as well. If you're thinking about that beer tonight that might get your through a day, but if you're thinking about retiring in a little cabin on some property you have a nice garden on, it's a different sort of focus. Sometimes you need to focus on 5 oclock to get through the day, sometimes you need to have that zen moment thinking about where you'll be after you're done working for good, and sometimes you have to think about that next step that will get you there.  
I'm working on a story about a woman whose fianc√©e was lost in a dream between sleep and awake and she has to go into the dream world to find him and convince him to wake up, but he knows that if he wakes up the entire universe his dream comprises will end and that this is more important than waking up.

Here is a word cloud of all of the comments in this thread: http://i.imgur.com/qzpoAqJ.png  source code | contact developer  
I want to hang this up in my cube at work.  
I have succumbed to this multiple times.  
Every single morning bro.  
yes. I start thinking well you know we aren't really doing anything today, this week won't be that important, do I really need to go to college?  I have been known to accidentally miss the bus on some such mornings.  
Every day. Also, as soon as I wake up, I already hate everything.   
Last time it happened was this morning. I had an important meeting with the police (minor traffic incident) and thought about 1000 excuses before I crawled out of bed. Looking forward to the creative ideas I come up with tomorrow morning.  
I have an amazing job that I love, but at least once a week, I start the first few seconds thinking "Fuck this!!!! Fuck all of this!!! NOPE!".  
I usually wake up in a half dream state where I convince myself that the thing I was dreaming about is an acceptable reason to be late for work. One of my more recent and memorable examples was when Bill Gate's car broke down in front of my house. I let him in and we hung out for a while. When my alarm clock went off, I simply told myself that everyone at work would understand if I was late because I had to entertain Bill Gates. I turned off the alarm and went back to sleep.  
Recently I've come to the realization that I need to get the hell out of my current place of work. Every time I hear that alarm go off it's a reminder of how unhappy I'm going to be for the next 12 hours. I need to get my shit together and get out.  
Same here. No room for advancement. No way I'll get more hours. I'm part time and accrue no benefits. No sick time, PTO, vacation, nothing. No retirement plan to pay into. I took the job because I needed money. It pays decent but I'd rather be full-time at minimum wage actually accruing benefits and paying into a retirement plan.   
I'm in training for 7.5 weeks with only one day off. I'm up at 4am everyday. I've contemplated just dropping out for more sleep. Mind you, I am not a morning person on top of that.   
I always wake up, feel like I'm awake enough to just close my eyes for a "few more seconds", count to 15 in my head... Wake up an hour later then my irrational thinking takes over... "well I'm already late, 15 more seconds"   
Reminds me of a Louis ck joke. He says "I've passed on entire careers because I didn't want to wake up in the morning. I just say to myself 'oh I just won't be that anymore.'"   
It's more like I see my cat still sleeping on the bed when I wake up. So, I kick her off so she can wake the Meow up and not stay sleeping. Hit an all time low.  
Every day a voice in my head tries to convince me I could make it as an indie game developer, and every day I have to shut it up by reminding it I have no talent. Back to the IT slavepits for me.  
That's why I'm home today!  
I'm doing this long after I get out of bed.    
no  
I feel like I'm the only one but when i wake up early and I barely slept, I somehow relate my alarm to whatever I was doing last night or to the dream i had. For instance, I could have played Skyrim last night and the next morning I would think my phone alarm is going off because I had leveled up and I needed to pick a skill. I'll start pressing buttons on my phone to get that skill. Played Cs:go? My alarm is the bomb and in my head I'm pressing e to defuse it, no matter what my hands are doing. I usually have to set about 4 alarms before I realize that the thing I'm holding is my phone and it's time to wake up...  
I started this terrible game called What would I do instead?. It starts when the alarm goes off. I always hit snooze. Then I spend the next 10 minutes fantasizing about what I could do if I didn't have to go to work. Sometimes it's elaborate like taking the dogs and driving to the beach for a few days, sometimes more mundane like finish that book that kept me up half the night or go back to sleep.   
Every fuckin' day.  
I actually almost skipped class this morning.   
I immediately start thinking of excuses to call out of work or be late.

The secret is to make an excuse that is slightly embarrassing. Something like "I cut myself shaving my ballsack. I'm waiting for it to stop bleeding, so I might be a tad late." If that's too much, here's one that I've used at every job I've had. "I couldn't drive. I left a fast food bag under the seat on accident, and my car was crawling with ants this morning." Works every time.  
In the past yes and I did in fact quit three jobs like this when I was young and stupid. Whilst satisfying it's ultimately far less satisfying than getting paid at the end of the month  
Only every morning.  
Yeah. I do it all the time.  To ensure I get up on the day of an exam, I tape my alarm clock to the side of my head. Before I can turn off the alarm, I have to un-tape my head, which involves a lot of hair pulling (ensuring I actually get up)  
I used to do this when I started a checkout shift at 8am, then managed to sort my shifts so they are all late afternoon, evening.  
Every. Damn. Day. Especially taking a low salary job.  Back in the college days, it was "If I swerve into oncoming traffic into this semi truck, I bet I could get out of taking this midterm..."  
Holy cow! this is too close to my heart - I've taken so many sick days just because I wanted to sleep more.  
I've heard of some jobs which have duvet days - a day where you can call up and just stay in bed at short notice. Like a special kind of sick day, but whereby you freely admit you CBA coming in. Sadly none of my jobs have had that.  
Admitting you can't get out of bed seems like a trap to me. Just like how they give you sick days and don't expect you to take any.  
Literally quit a job once cuz i wanted 2 more hours of sleep. But instead of sleeping, all I could do is think about everything people had been saying to me about my job and why it sucked...so I rationalized and justified quitting "for sleep" but I think subconsciously I really didn't wanna work for Kirby vacuums  
Yeah. And then you inevitably finish eating ten minutes into an hour episode or two-hour movie.  
And then you eat something else. And again. And again. And oh shit get me that gym subscription  
Exactly how I feel but less gym motivation  
Happy Cake Day!  
Gotta get that drug fix   
Gym subscription, is that when it arrives in your mailbox? =P  
Sorry, not my native language hahaha. How's it actually called?  
Membership. =)  
Dear god, yesüòÖ  
I related on a personal level  
Yesterday I ended up burning my food in the toaster oven because I was taking too long to find something to watch. It's a real problem.   
I have the opposite problem. My food quite often will get cold because I can't find something to watch.  
Im pretty diligent when it comes to watching my food so it doesn't over cook and burn and I thought I could pick something before that happened but I lost that race. I've definitely had to eat cold food too because spending 20 minutes going through streaming apps to find something to watch took too long.   
Happens all the time to me. Sometimes it will take me 45 minutes just to decide on something to watch.  
I've stopped cooking food on stovetop after putting a movie on first for exactly this reason.   
I do this with every meal. I can't stand the sound of food being chewed, and, because I need something to look at besides what's in my plate or bowl. Might as well be something I'm looking forward to watching.   
Oh I hate chewing noises, too. Growing up, we watched tv during dinner. My parents have stopped watching television nearly altogether and eating at their place is my idea of hell now.   
FYI that‚Äôs called misophonia   
I cringe when I'm watching people on TV eat in silence. The scraping of eating utensils against the plate AND chewing? Drives me mad. Absolutely mad.   
Is it really that bad? My whole adolescent life we would eat dinner and sometimes lunch together. We all were taught good manners and ate quietly with our mouths closed. Obviously there are some noises made like scratching a bowl, cutting meat. I always enjoyed the conversation rather than watching something and no one is interacting. When I am alone I do watch stuff though. I don't understand how something that naturally occurs when eating could drive you mad lol. It's not hard to chew quietly. Different strokes for different folks I guess   
Misophonia  
Small noises bother me. Chewing, scraping, clearing your throat around me, taptaptap on a keyboard, the clicking of a mouse, and so on. I also have a little ringing in my ears all the time, so I need to sleep with music on.   
Like that Christmas vacation movie?  
For me it's youtube but yeah. I won't eat my lunch until I find a video I can watch for about 15 minutes or so and eat my food too. Same thing for breakfast, I'll have my coffee and a breakfast biscuit or two to GMM usually.  
Not sure if you know this subreddit, but its cool.  https://www.reddit.com/r/mealtimevideos/  
I'll have to check that out thanks.  
That is a fantastic subreddit. Even after just about ten years on Reddit, almost every day I find something new I didn't know about. Thank you for sharing that subreddit.  
I don't know why but if I can't watch tv for some reason I'll put judge judy on YouTube while I eat. I hate that I do this because I can't reasonably justify watching judge judy on a screen that is actually 3/4 the size of the actual phone screen because the uploader has to make a frame of advertisements around it.   
Dude same! I've developed a Pavlovian instinct where I get hungry if I'm not eating while watching GMM because I've eaten while watching it for so long.  
It's crazy how the brain works and how in a routine it can get in and how it hates changing the routine.  
 To GMM usually  Sometimes I forget other people watch GMM  
r/mealtimevideos :)   
I have finally found my people.   
Yup. I've had many a pizza go cold that way. Hells Kitchen is a fav indulgence makes me savor every bite. The opposite would occur as well when a new show would premier and I would just have to make myself something to eat as I watch.  
I feel like this is both the worst thing and the best thing to do when you're home alone watching tv. If I find a movie or show that I was really looking forward to watching I have to prepare an epic meal, if I already haven't.   
I'm so glad I'm not alone. It is extremely frustrating to have your hot food in front of you and you're hungry but you can't touch it until you find something good to watch.  Most of the time I just wont make my plate or open my Friday Night Food Dipped In Gravy from my favorite Jamaican/Trinidad spot until I find something worthy to watch, that will make eating like a pig fun.......it can take what seems like hours.  There are too many movie channels and apps but still not enough.........if that makes any sense.  Happy movie hunting.   
You‚Äôve perfectly described my food routine too. It‚Äôs good to know I‚Äôm not the only weirdo who does this!  
Hell yes. I make sure to time it perfectly. Get to the start of what I want to watch and put it on pause right when my food is ready to be plated.  
Yes, and finish eating like 5 minutes in lol  
Happens every time. Then you have to make more! Sometimes, whatever I'm watching will become boring to me if I don't have a good snack. I hate myself for this.   
I find the trick is finding something I want to watch enough but not care about enough to follow completely. Ironically Kitchen Nightmares or Come Dine With Me are pretty ace  
Yes, but it‚Äôs just episodes of the Office. Always the Office.  
It's always nice to watch comedies during lunch break, but drama at night. For me it's Brooklyn Nine Nine and House MD; I've done three rewatches because of it.  
I haven‚Äôt done that exactly but if I‚Äôm watching something and I start really enjoying it, I stop it and go get a snack to eat with it. It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs so good it requires popcorn or nachos.   
Yes, it's like a complex. My food will literally go cold if I haven't found the right thing to watch while I eat  
yes and  I'm frustrated my food is getting cold but I'm so indecisive i can't decide on a show, but i also can't eat til i find a show! Quite the conundrum!   
The other night i took so long I ruined mac n cheese bc I had to reheat it twice.  
Yes, I purposely avoid watching my DVRed shows so I have something to watch when I‚Äôm eating.   
Yeah then the food‚Äôs cold once you finally find a movie   
Yes! Everything has to be perfect and then I eat üòÅ  
I always make sure there is a show to watch before preparing any food whatsoever  
I think my digestive system doesn't work without audiovisual stimulation.  
All the time. Lining up your dinner w a movie is one of the simple pleasures of life  
That's why you just watch The Office on repeat. It's always good, light humor for 20 or so minutes to accompany your meal   
Yep and sometimes I‚Äôll eat it slow or stop eating so I can eat it over 2 episodes   
No, I eat at the table like a civilized human being.  
I have been unknowingly elected to the office of ‚Äúkeeper of the remote‚Äù so I end up having to get something going on the TV before I start eating. It‚Äôs not a fun position.   
I always have to find that perfect YouTube video before eating. Been like this for years.  
Yasssss. Yep  
Yes! It's part of the whole meal Ritual. Stupid me always makes the food and then finds a show instead of the other way around. So my food is half cold when I start eating   
or a book to read.  
I do this but with either Youtube videos or Twitch streams. I don't watch TV haha.   
Yes. I am not a fan at all of focusing on myself eating. I love cooking and enjoy the taste, but I don't want enough quiet in my mind to contemplate every bite. My fiance meanwhile will chow down on his food in the car on the way home.  
I could never eat while driving. I don't think I could even focus on enjoying my meal over all the road rage I experience here in NY.  
I tell myself every other driver is an off duty cop.  Keeps me from getting angry at people on the road.  
The worst part is that many of them probably are. I see so many more police cruisers a day in NY than anywhere else I've been.   
I barely wait until it‚Äôs out of the pan.   
Yes I do this too,to my own dislike actually!  Every damn time my food gets cold!   
Yes!!! Same!!! ‚Äã Because if I don't, then I will literally be done eating before I pick my show!   
Not every meal but usually if I‚Äôm alone (no husband or daughter) I will definitely wait until I got my food setup and start a good show.   
Yes I do. Does anyone else like to eat alone so they can watch and eat in peace?  
Yup, this is me.  My mom and I watched The Young and the Restless while we ate dinner ever since I was a kid. Once I moved out, I maintained the habit. I didn‚Äôt have cable so I would have to wait til the episode was uploaded online the next day. Sometimes it would be uploaded late and I would be sitting there ready with my food with no episode to watch. I would usually rewatch an old episode lol. Weekends suck because there‚Äôs no Y&R! I will literally let my food go cold if I am trying to find something to watch.  I actually laughed with my mom this morning because we were both eating breakfast and watching yesterday‚Äôs episode that we didn‚Äôt catch last night. We were finished our breakfast by the time the opening credits began lmfao.   
r/firstworldproblems  
Absolutely   
I absolutely need the TV on when I'm eating. It's an annoying habit but it's even more annoying to sit in silence. Music just doesn't do it for me. Music is better for relaxing.   
ugh, this so much.   but online instead.    
Ugh, this is the bane of my life! From Iplayer, to Youtube, to Instagram videos, you get sucked in and before you know it it's hours later and you're on your 4th pack of Doritos scrolling through that gym membership. Bane of my life.  
Yes, but I always pick and setup the video first. By the time the logos/intro is over the food has probably cooled.  
6pm the simpsons every weekday  
God this is the worst thing ever. Especially trying to find something on netflix that I have seen as yet.   
My wife and I do this every night. Sometimes our food gets cold because we can't find something to watch!   
r/mealtimevideos  
There‚Äôs nothing more disappointing than a cheesy plate of nachos going cold while I wait for Netflix to let me watch an episode of The Office.  
Yes! Cooking and watching the television or waiting to eat until we get the show we want to watch and it gets cold. Can‚Äôt stand the sound of myself or anyone chewing.   
I haven't gone to a doctor about it. I just make sure I have enough background noise going on at all times so it's bearable.   
Me but with YouTube.  
I can not say so for myself, no, I‚Äôm too hungry to wait to find the right show. My guy on the other hand, yes. So while he‚Äôs scrolling for the right thing to watch, my plate is half way eaten.  
If I am watching a show with weekly episodes, Amazon usually puts them up at midnight the night they aired. I like to get up early the next morning at like 6am to watch it, and I always like to eat while doing this. It's the best way to watch shows like Mr Robot. :)  
This is literally me! I can't eat at all unless I have something good to watch. And yeah I will spend 10mins looking for something to watch and sometimes my food gets cold while I'm watching :(  
Yes fuck to the yes you are not alone dude Hahahaha   
Oh man, this is one of my worst food related behaviors. I typically will spend time picking out what I want to watch before making food. But more often than not, by the time my food is prepared & ready to eat, when I sit down to grub & watch, I've changed my mind about my selection. And then I'll spend another hours sifting through the internet for something that suits my new mood. It's reason #564 why I'm still single after 8 years lol  
I usually eat slower than normal until I find a YouTube video to watch  
Yes.  Still waiting.    
I‚Äôm kind of like this with everything. I like to describe it as me feeling the need to be ‚Äògrounded‚Äô before I start any task.  I hate eating unless I‚Äôm at a table, and if it‚Äôs a wobbly or cluttered table I lose my mind.   
I did this but with YouTube videos instead. Usually of videos of people talking or playing games.   
For me its books. I love to read and eat at the same time. I've waited until I found a super good one to read. It's a habit I started at a very young age.  
How do you do it? I am afraid of staining my books by mistake :(  
Hold the book in one hand, eat with the other. Do nooot switch hands lol. Its kinda easier now that I read on my phone though, I did have a couple incidents as a kid, despite holding my Harry Potter book up and open with my left fingers, still got sauce on a page ‚òπ Now that's it on a phone, I hold with my left and make sure one finger is food free for swiping.  
Every Friday morning, make breakfast. Achievement Hunter minecraft  
yep same here, yo  
r/mealtimevideos  
I seem to finish my food before I find something to watch because I'm pickier about what I'm watching g than what I'm eating. Unless I find something to watch before I start to make/eat.  
I stick to animes when eating because of this. I already have a show I've been watching and know what episode I'm on so there's no need to go searching.  
It's crazy all these little nuances that I have encountered being shared by a shit ton of people that only I thought I experienced. We're far more alike then we think.   
And not just that, I won't start eating until the opening ends  
Yes! But usually I will pick something to watch for when I know my food will be ready. I‚Äôll then pause the TV and refuse to watch it until I‚Äôve got my food. I do it with takeaway too - I am not pressing play until that food gets to my house.  
Many of my meals have gone cold this way  
Yes. Or until I toke. üòÑ  
That‚Äôs me exactly. Thanks, I thought I was a lone weirdo for this.  
This is a really interesting thread for me. I didn‚Äôt even know it was that common to eat in front of the TV! I‚Äôm not sure I could do it because I‚Äôd feel like I wasn‚Äôt able to concentrate on enjoying my food, nor able to concentrate on the TV show. But then I think I‚Äôm a bit odd like that - I can‚Äôt work and listen to music as the music distracts me from work and the work distracts me from the music.  
I don‚Äôt like cold food so I don‚Äôt do this   
I do this even when doing the dishes or brushing my teeth in the morning.  
Not just that, but the right line up of YouTube videos, if I'm on the computer  
I‚Äôve always wondered about the psychology behind this  
I get the tv going before the meal gets to the coffee table!   
this is posted to this sub like once a month  
See you next month!  
Always, and once I hit that play button. Pure bliss   
I pick a show, pause it.. then start to cook! My food always got cold while I looked.  
Yes every day!  
The amount of times I've done this, can't decide on what to watch and I'm eating cold vegetarian sausages whilst watching something I've already seen 10x over.  
It's like you never start masturbating until you find the right porn.  
This is me. I‚Äôve got a bunch of messages I‚Äôve left on read! Even went as far as deleting my WhatsApp (don‚Äôt have any social media besides reddit). I can‚Äôt lie, it feels good in a sense...  
[deleted]  
man if you do that for a while then (while some people take it personally) you just become that person who does that sometimes and when you come back it‚Äôs just like you never left. good friends understand  
I have all my group chats in WhatsApp on mute apart from 1 or 2 with family and 1 with a couple of my friends from school, that way when I do feel like talking to everyone I can just jump on there and say hey...but yeah I‚Äôve just deleted Facebook due to unwanted messages from people and honestly, I‚Äôm not regretting it at all haha.  
Oh man leaving all social media behind only gets more freeing the longer you're away  
Amen to that brother  
Well I get why I love reddit.  
I feel you. Last year, my phone screen was completely broken, but my phone still worked. I had an iPod touch that connected to my phone and my calls and texts would come through there, but it felt so good to message everyone saying, ‚Äúhey my phone broke so i can‚Äôt really respond to messages right now,‚Äù and ignoring any messages i got afterwards. I was out of town for a couple of months, so my friends and family understood that I probably wouldn‚Äôt get a replacement until I came back. Didn‚Äôt check texts or social media for like two months, only replied to important messages to let everyone know I was okay lol. Most blissful two months of my life. I go back and forth though. Sometimes I‚Äôm really good at replying to people. Other times I just wanna turn my phone off forever.  
It really can be liberating to just be in your own bubble sometimes... I totally relate to the broken phone. Been considering getting rid of my iPhone for a much much simpler one for just calls and costly text messages haha  
It feels good like the sweet release of death  
If I‚Äôve been really social or work/life has been intense or stressful then I‚Äôll need some major alone/recharge time and might spend 24-72 hours hiding out in my house/room avoiding contact with most of the world. But it feels good not bad or sad. I need it to recharge and I try to enjoy every second of it and not feel bad about taking that time for myself. Edit; I did a personality test once that said I‚Äôm 60% introvert and that sounds about right. I think I‚Äôm an over achieving introvert lol Edit; I‚Äôd just like to pat myself on the back for saying overachieving introvert instead of underachieving extrovert. Way to be my own friend! That‚Äôs new :)  
I need a recharge time after doing social things too. Being out doing things drains me.  
introvert  
Idk who downvoted you, because that's true.  
Thx friend. Downvotes hurt sometimes.  
What test was it?  
I think it was the MBTI.  
i got INFP-T, which apparently means i‚Äôm the exact opposite of what most employers value in every way. my main suggested careers are things like ‚Äúart‚Äù and ‚Äúmusic‚Äù, and while i love those things my likelihood of making a living from those things is very low (I= introverted, N= intuitive, meaning pretty much stoned hippie thought pattern, F= feely/emotional, P= disorganized/indecisive, and then the tacked on T for ‚Äútumultuous‚Äù pretty much means mentally unwell so yeah)  
If you don‚Äôt mind me saying it seems like you‚Äôve put a pretty negative spin on that as apposed to celebrating positives and opportunity. I have worked in the arts for years along side many talented and successful artists, musicians and organizers. It‚Äôs a creative and awesome sector which a ton of opportunity (not just to be the artists but to the marketer, event producer, administrator etc). It‚Äôs your life right? What do you want? How do you want to feel about it? What do you want to cultivate?  I might be off base but it sounds like you‚Äôre a very creative sensitive and empathetic individual and life might feel a bit overwhelming for you. Like you‚Äôre not seen and valued? You‚Äôre special! We need your contributions in our society. I NEED you in my community for sure! Our current culture is fucken weird and it impacts us empaths greatly if we don‚Äôt find ways of protect our hearts and creative souls or to move through daily stress in healthy ways and stop worry/stay positive. Don‚Äôt undervalue your gifts.  
Hello, fellow INFP-T! How's quarentine for you?  
Any good site to take one of these tests on?  
What if it lasts years  
Well that doesn‚Äôt sound very enjoyable and though life has natural ups and downs I think it‚Äôs fair to expect that you should be mostly feeling pretty alright and definitely able to show yourself some love on the daily.  Answer back/DM me if you wanna talk more about that. There are some common causes and helpful questions you could explore if you‚Äôre feeling stuck. It‚Äôs not uncommon for people to go through some pretty major and length depression in life ‚Äî especially in today‚Äôs fucked up society.  
I do especially after having a few days of being really social. It's like I need a day alone to decompress.  
Smoke, Covid, election, economy. I want to stay in bed, covers over my head, refusing to engage with all the other humans who have made this possible  
Reading your comment lying on bed with covers over my head because I feel depressed by smoke, pandemic, elections, and all the stupid hateful fucks out there, I can totally understand how you are feeling.  
Same, except I'm eating tacos.  
Definitely. I go through cycles when I want to be around people. Then after I‚Äôm around them, I come home drained. I recharge through spending time alone. Repeat the process. It feels like 98% of the time, I‚Äôm a sloth who talks to people. After a while. The other 2%, I‚Äôm a golden retriever with the zoomies wanting to talk with everyone. The 2% is exhausting.  
Couldn't have described it better. So accurate...  
Wow! Exactly me!  
I never want to be around people  
For sure... just deleted my Insta and Facebook - I just think those forms of Social Media are toxic af and cant be dealing with them. Busted out my old comic books and making my way through Watchmen and listening to new albums as well! Not always a bad thing to want to spend time with yourself.  
i‚Äôve been contemplating deleting all my social media too, i just want to be away from the world and be in my own (if that makes sense)  
Of course dude. My issue with the social media is the complete toxicity of it. I want to chat to people about the UFC I've just watched - on insta you're called a casual for having a different opinion and no ones willing to discuss. I want to chat about the football game I've just watched on my teams FB page - everyone has their own opinion and, like insta, you are insulted for opening a discussion and having a different one.  Reddit is the only place I can go to actually have decent conversations and exchange opinions etc The sooner I removed social media from my life, the better it became - anyone who wants to contact you can still do it via messenger (just click 'disable account' and delete the Fb app on your phone but leave Messenger) and anyone who is worth something to you has your number right?! The rest is unnecessary in my opinion.  
I‚Äôve just deleted my Facebook because it just became very toxic. For starters everyone thinks they‚Äôre a politician and there‚Äôs just debates left, right and centre over everything but the kitchen sink and when I‚Äôm already feeling shit I want to see and read dumb shit to cheer myself up, not read a bunch of arguments about Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbin haha. I then broke up with my bf a few months ago and that just opened the gates of guys sliding in your DMs you haven‚Äôt spoken to for years and not getting the hint when you ignore them because they‚Äôre creeps, and I still had my ex on Facebook because we‚Äôre still on civil terms and there were just some comments of his that were really pissing me off, so I just decided it was time to delete the app and so far I‚Äôm not regretting it. Insta I find a little easier to stay on because I‚Äôve set my account to private and only have people on there that I talk to regularly (As opposed to Facebook in which I had people added from school who I barely talk to) that and over half the accounts I follow on Insta are wrestling related so my timeline is just spammed with WWE and AEW content lol.  
Lol me too but with UFC and Formula 1, but even then I find the Insta audiences for UFC so vile and rude. You cant have a civil discussion!  Yeah Facebook sucks... it really has turned into a political tool now..  
I logged out of then because I use them for dating apps but God do I want to delete them  
Surely there is another way to be able to log in to dating apps?!  
[deleted]  
I have ADHD too and I do relate. But why is this true?  
I feel it‚Äôs because our brains are constantly going, and then physically our bodies need to just rest  
Yes.  It‚Äôs bad.  I have demanding small children and a challenging job too.  Just want to be away from all of it.  All the time lately.  
Man I feel this.  
Yes, and it is usually a sign of depression.  It might be helpful to seek counseling. It was and continues to be helpful for me!  
Yup. Anhedonia (losing interest in things) is one of the key factors in depression.  
[deleted]  
Cus your counsellor was useless  
So what exactly should depressed people do then? Continue to be depressed? Pile on the health risks and other physical changes that can result from depression (or whatever mental illness they suffer from)? Potentially harm themselves?  
As frustrating as it can be, sometimes it takes a couple of tries to find the right counselor.  If counseling isn‚Äôt helpful no matter what, then it might be time to consider seeing a psychiatrist and discussing medication to get you to a point where counseling will be helpful.  
I want to strongly emphasize, to not you specifically but everyone here suggesting counseling in general, that it costs time and money to get your mental health in check. Yes, there can be great sources for people who can't afford the privilege like sliding scales or free city clinics. However, it can be rare and difficult depending on the individual's lifestyle. Working 2-3 jobs without a car to make ends meet while scrambling to raise a child can be a major setback. That's just one example. I'm not trying to discourage anyone from trying to make counseling work for them despite the difficulties. Only to paint a picture of how hard it can be to actually take care of your mental health as an impoverished or working class person.  
me right now I hate explaining it but I also don‚Äôt want people to think they are the reason I‚Äôm distant üò£  
i know , it‚Äôs hard to explain to people why you feel this way but you just do , you know ?  
totally and it‚Äôs also good to have people who like you‚Äôre comfortable with. I‚Äôm lucky I have a few good friends .  
I think it's a pretty standard human feeling. Very normal and common. I was thinking about why this it's though...    I think after spending time around other people even if you're having fun you're going to be physically drained from all of the... I can't think of a word for it.... Basically all the thoughts and actions that you have to do when you're around other people that you probably wouldn't have to use it were just you by yourself. Since nobody else is exactly like us all of us have countless different things that they have to remember or consciously decide to not care about when in public. There are the occasional people who are ignorant of all social cues and don't have to run through all the mental checks of shit like "did I brush my teeth?" "Am I standing straight?" " did I stare at that person too long?"        I think an interesting question to ask would be who doesn't feel this way?? Even somebody who is outgoing and loves being around other people still has to exert more energy than they would if they were by themselves. I would be interested in knowing what goes on in the minds of people who don't feel this way ever.  
Yup! Either introversion or social burnout. But yeah I get like this a lot.  
I can't tell lately because it's pretty much every day in 2020 since March  
I‚Äôm kinda going through that right now. My neighbor keeps wanting to hang out, but I kinda want to be left alone.  
Yes. It‚Äôs called serenity.  
Sometimes people just bore me because they talk about useless stuff, sometimes your mind is the best place to be.  
I do and I don't. I want to be with people that want to be around me. But no one does so I would rather be alone.  
Same  
Yes. I was doing that a lot then went on antidepressants and don‚Äôt feel like doing that anymore. For me this was depression  
This is a sign of depression. I feel this way often too. It's a hard time when you're alone with your thoughts. I overthink and that's the worst part about being alone when you're mind is running  
usually i just sit alone in my room in the dark and enjoy the silence  
I just feel sorry for myself for a few days and then I'm ok until next time lol  
Yes and my boyfriend hates me for it. He's luke "stop being depressed,  already.  It's bumming me out."  
i‚Äôm scared to get into a relationship cause i get like this all the time and they last about 2 weeks, maybe even a month so it‚Äôs pretty hectic  
You shouldn‚Äôt be afraid to be in a relationship because of this. I‚Äôve been married for 4 years now and I am very much an introvert. I come home drained from work or just other life tasks and stress, and my wife is understanding and knows to give me my space when I‚Äôm down. You just gotta find that person that will understand the introvert in you, and how life drains you and how sometimes you need some time alone. Sometimes they can even help you get out of the pit of depression and stress and help distract you from it. You just gotta find the right one.  
 "stop being depressed,  already.  It's bumming me out."    r/thanksimcured  
Yeah, that's why i don't talk to him about personal stuff.  
Why yes I have also seen Shrek  
Welcome to my life  
This is regular for me and I hate if. I hate that I become this way. I‚Äôm the social butterfly. It makes my soul so sad.  
I feel like that all the time. Like i can‚Äôt enjoy games anymore or even talking to my friends now.  
i have such a hard time replying to my friends or people in general , i just can‚Äôt find the energy to do so and they get mad at that :/  
Dude i feel the same way. My friends prolly hate me by now  
At least you have friends  
Yeeees, and I have to make up some excuses that I'm busy or something  
Society has a tendency to do that with people, it's because your inner drive for completing goals gets exhausted by all the duties you have to fulfill and all the short-term happiness you consume. Social Media is the worst offender, so I suggest you throw your phone off a cliff, then do as much as you can to disconnect from society. As others have pointed out, this is a sign of depression, and its a direct cause of your surroundings. You need to escape this, so I suggest you find somewhere off the grid to live, and try to get yourself a more self-sustaining lifestyle.  
Yes, but this is just your body's response to being overwhelmed (aka "shut-down"). It is important to find rest on a daily basis, whatever "rest" means to you that day. Spending time with and by yourself to restore the present moment is vital to long-term happiness and survival. Of course you can still experience dips, but they become more shallow and fewer between with practice. That's basically the foundation of yoga.  
Shit yes, but minus the loss of interest in everything. I'm still interested in certain things at these times, but talking and listening is not one of them. I just wish I was able to carve out more alone time than I currently am.  
Yes but I have clinical depression...  
I hate to say it but I loved lockdown in the UK. I was between jobs so not receiving furlough. I was never bored but I would literally get up before my husband and drink a cup of tea in peace and ponder life. He would get up and see to his allotment and pigeon loft. I‚Äôd do all the cleaning that I needed to do first thing , plan dinner and prepare in the slow cooker. The day then was my own and I‚Äôd sit in the sun and read, doze or just sit quietly listening to the bird song. God I miss it so much!  
Yes. When I was a teenager I did the Outward Bound thing, a 23 day course, and during the course we each had to do a 3-day solo. No human contact, in the woods, with basically no food, a plastic tarp, a notebook, and that‚Äôs it.  It was extremely hard and painful at times, but I learned a lot about myself and the way I really felt about my family and friends, and life in general.  
These are all symptoms of depression. Everyone thinks depression always includes sadness, but it doesn't. Depression can often lead to lost of interest in yourself, and others which can lead to social isolation.  
Lose*üòî  
Literally every morning üòÇ  
yes, but in 2015, so it's been 5 years staying alone, and lost all my interests.  
staying alone sounds like a beautiful dream to me  
it's addictive, and hurts your mental health. i think i became Misanthrope  
Yes. I believe that's called depression  
All the fckng time tbh. But i was diagnosed with depression 6 years ago so ü§∑üèæ  
ADHD also does that to me  
Sounds like depression üëâüòéüëâ  
well damn üòé‚úåÔ∏è  
That‚Äôs me rn  
Feel you here, have got the similar feeling at the moment, hope you are alright OP  
Honestly I feel like this when my depression is in full force. When I feel like sometimes I just allow it, and other days I‚Äôll take myself for a walk. Pull myself out of the funk.  
everyday since 1995  
Congrats! This is what depression feels like  
The world is too much sometimes.  
Yeah that‚Äôs called Depression. I should know, I‚Äôve been living with it for over a decade now.  
Yes, for me that‚Äôs called depression  
I often atop dating and hanging out for long periods of time after a small spree of having a social or dating life.  I'd rather be alone 24/7. Peoplenare tiring and want to do way too much in their spare time.  
Well yeah, why do you think I‚Äôm sitting alone in silence with no human contact?  
Absolutely. The first few days of last week I had some good days, was way more energetic than normally, way more social than normally, etc. Now I'm back to my normal solitude. And it's always like this. Social contact exhausts me. Normally during. Sometimes though not during, which makes me extremely energetic and social. But after a few days of that I collapse.  
Been there done that  
It is just depression. First time?  
i mean it happens a lot but during quarantine and now it was and still is at its peak  
I understand what you mean.  Quarantine causes many of the problems for people. There are those who lost their work and there are those who have not met their friends for a long time, and some people have caused their lives to stagnate and make it meaningless.  And all of this causes and exacerbates depression, so I advise you to find a hobby for yourself or to communicate with your family and friends more because everything is better with friends, and if things get worse, I advise you to contact the specialists in these matters to get a better result.   We are all together in this disaster, be strong  
I have some medical issues and am going on nearly 20 months of self imposed quarantine(so far)...I have a friend to whom I give two rides a month to do her shopping(she as payment picks up what I might need from those stores(I give her my CC and PIN)) and order my groceries online so I can have them brought to my car instead of going inside(yes I always wear a mask everywhere outside my home) Other than that(and doctor's appointments) I have not spoken to anyone in person for this amount of time...it seems the longer this goes on the less interest I have in normal social interaction TBO My time on Reddit satisfies any urge I might have to speak out loud to others...so much so in fact I sometimes have to practice talking so I can be understood on the phone if it's been a specially long time since I last uttered a word  
Yeah been doing that for the past year  
As an extrovert who doesn't have social anxiety usually. No,no I don't.  
I feel like this everyday  
All the time, and it comes out of nowhere too. Im either way more introverted than I thought, or i get the occasional bout of extra spicy depression lol  
‚Äúextra spicy depression‚Äù  golden  
A day or two is fine, a month? Maybe if you‚Äôre a hermit. Any longer? That‚Äôs depression buddy. Get help if it doesn‚Äôt pass in 4-6 weeks or so  
Me right now  
Totally, even though you care deeply, you don't! It's a horrible feeling, sending hugs x  
yeah even though i try to care about something i just can‚Äôt find the energy to do so... as bad as it may sound i just simply don‚Äôt care and it bothers me sometimes but most times it‚Äôs almost like whatever  
All. The. Time  
God dam I‚Äôm so glad to read this today and know I‚Äôm not the only one!  
Yes, but I also crave productivity to fill the void. Sadly I often lack the motivation to do anything.  
You may have depression my friend.  
should probably talk to a doctor about it huh ?  
You probably should. When you are ready. Depression is a sneaky sneaky bastard.  
If your interest or feeling towards things suddenly changes in a bad way you should talk to your doctor about depression  
you rate?  
My brothers all bought cars with the insurance money after mama passed. I bought 11 acres of land to have an outdoor space that didn‚Äôt have other people in it. I think mine was the better purchase.  
Yes but I figured it had to do with depression or something  
Yeah this happens with me too ! I broke contact with ny classmates as soon as i passed  high school.. Since then i stay like this , alone and on my own trip in life  
Almost daily.  
Right now.  
I wouldn't use the word "suddenly" since that is my default state.  
understandable  
Yes, it‚Äôs called Sunday.  
‚ÄúIs anyone else depressed‚Äù Can we please have not such obviously relatable things in this sub.  
I feel like this is every single post on this subreddit  
Yeah and when that feeling happens, just do it. It's worth it. It feels refreshing.  
Yeah, I've been doing that for 4 months now. Completely off the grid, especially on social media. I gotta tell you, its the best period eveeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrr. I used to be very depressive and affected with the things that were posted on social media sometimes as, well, I have depression, BPD, and anxiety. It was a gamble for me because, with the field that I'm in right now, social media like Instagram is essential. One day, I just decided to deactivate everything from IG to Twitter and even Facebook. Best decision ever. I'm still off the grid actually. I just stick to my usual thing like Netflix and Reddit (my escape). Nobody texts me, other than my close friends that would check on my sanity from time to time. There's a lot of self-reflection and self-discovering going on. During this time, I started working out as a form of self-upgrading. My intent was to come back on social media in 2021 with newfound confidence.  I had this talk with my friends about how I'm way 'beyond depression' right now. I was depressive in the early stages of my 'hibernation' as I just got out of a new job that was taking a toll on my health and mental health. It was such a relief yet a disappointing decision. Next, you start to think about who really gives a shit about you during these times. Those who reach out, I bet you, they care truly. Then, there are others who you thought cared but nope. And then, there are others that you never thought would reach out to you. The universe always has a way of unveiling the truth.  Right now, I'm just riding the wave. I'm way beyond depression. Trying to gather the energy to craft something from scratch so that I could earn some side income from it other than freelancing. I have to prep myself for 2021 as I have all these dreams that I wanna achieve real bad. Sorry for the long comment (tend to do that always haha). But all I can say is, if you need a break from the world, do it. That's your body telling you enough. It's time to learn about yourself again. There might be a little bit of unlearning and relearning things about yourself. Take all the time you need. However, don't abandon your important commitments and responsibilities. I wish you all the luck and power in the universe <3  
Only always friend. Now fuck off and leave me alone.  
That's probably you reaching your mental capacity and/or depression. Happens to me often. A rollercoaster.  
Yes, I call this particular method being a Capricorn üòÖ but seriously though, I do and I friggin love it!  
Yes. It's generally referred to as depression.  
Sure, nothing wrong in that  
Wait, is this abnormal???  
Only always  
I find myself needing time to ‚Äòrecover‚Äô after heavy interaction with others... Most people cant understand that  
Yes - most days of the week, but i usually blame that feeling on depression. I feel guilty for feeling that way, and then try to do the things that I've lost interest in because they used to make me happy. Then, when they don't, I'm even more sad and depressed. Not a great cycle.  
The idea of doing nothing but reading in silence is quite appealing  
I do when i enter a depressive episode. But thats not always the reason why people do this.  A lot of responses talk about just needing a social recharge after an extended period of necessary socialization, which is a hugely valid reason to suddenly be like "woah, ok, i need a break".  Some people (like me) have mental illnesses that can, like a switch, make people and sound just way too much to deal with.  And sometimes prolonged overstimulation or stress can lead to the need for prolonged procrastination or lack of stimulation. Which could or could not be related to personality influences like intro- vs extrovert. :)  
Enjoy the mushrooms while they last  
I would  
That‚Äôs called a depressive episode  
At least once a month.  
Sometimes I feel like this even if I do have a girlfirend whom I love very much. My brain doesn‚Äôt function properly when I‚Äôm in that state and the only replies I can give is just ‚Äúah‚Äù ‚Äúyeah‚Äù etc.  
A mood swing it is?  
Yes indeed, and if i at the moment want to be social but not physically, i use social media.  
Yes it's called depression ugly monkey year  
It's called Major Depressive Disorder.  
if by suddenly loose you mean have felt like that their whole life then yes  
If by suddenly Loose you mean have felt like that Their whole life then yes - wirewolf  I detect haikus. And sometimes, successfully. Learn more about me. Opt out of replies: "haikusbot opt out" | Delete my comment: "haikusbot delete"  
Yes. Strong introvert here. But if I go longer than two weeks without any contact with friends, I spiral into depression. I‚Äôm constantly finding that balance.  
More and more every single day.  I use to be out going. I have been so disgusted with people it now gives me anxiety anytime my roommates have guests.  
That‚Äôs daily  
I do! I just did this last week and do it about once a month.  I hide in my apartment for about a week and avoid all non important phone calls and only leave my house if my pets need something.  I have to constantly reassure my friends that I'm not mad at them I just need to disappear for a while and that I'll be back soon. Most of them are used to it by now except for the super extroverted friends that think they're helping by blowing my phone up and harassing me to go out.  It's all in good nature but I avoid them the most.  
I lose interest in everyone and everything, even the things I like. But I don‚Äôt want to do nothing. But I can‚Äôt be bothered to do anything. But I can‚Äôt be bothered to do nothing. But i can‚Äôt be bothered to try something new.  I wonder why the fridge seems more empty lately.  
No, I lose interest.  
That happens to me when I go off my antidepressants. :x  
Yeah, that‚Äôs how introverts work  
God Yes!  
Currently doing it. I have been isolating myself from my friends. The only people I've talked to are my family and the internet.  The sad thing is that my isolation was triggered by a mental breakdown. The moment I had it, I immediately stopped reading and replying messages. On a happier note, I've now levelled up a lot in my games that I haven't played for a really long time and had been trying new phone games to pass the time. It's times like these you start to realise that despite having a lot of contact numbers, not one of them are people you would willingly not leave them at read.  
Yup. Reddit is probably your most sympathetic audience for this question.  
You are basically describing an introverts life rn  
Isn't it basically depression?  
Every day. The human race is appalling.  
Yes, and I do it.  
Yes, I do. I have clinical depression  
Yeah this is me. I feel this so much.  
Very often, kinda fill bad about neglecting ppl  
Yes. It‚Äôs called depression.  
well i read about this and its because we watch youtube alot. we learned to watch short clips that have different Topics . i have seen around 700 movie and 26 tv show . and i forced myself to see some of them. its really like a habit. but yeah i do the same thing. sometimes i even watch sully movies on tv and its easier than when i want to watch. i don't know but maybe because when i download movie i feel like i have to watch it. and we humans hate the things we have to do   
I love youtube but sometimes I spend to much time on there. It's my main form of TV watching but the short videos mean I spend more time scrolling around looking for something intersting than actually watching things.  
This is what happens to me. I'll watch Live PD for 2 hours before bed  
I think it's more likely for me to watch a 30 min youtube video than actually sitting to watch a 2 hour movie, the only time I do that is in the theatre and I barely go anymore  
I don't.  I get super pissed whenever something is put into video format when it can just as easily be an article.  Videos are for when I'm either binge-watching something episodic or multitasking with it on it the background. If I want information, something along the lines of a WikiHow is ideal.  
yea to much clicks, someday somebody will create a software where you queue movies or chapters from series like TV . i mean on kodi etc  
I know! I'm like, I really want to watch this, I'm downloading it. And as soon as it's on my computer I just... don't want to anymore. I have over 70 movies waiting to be watched.  
Im not from the YouTube generation, and since it‚Äôs introduced I never really watch anything on it, so that conclusion doesn‚Äôt really apply to me.  But I do hate to watch movies, and always felt odd about it. People seriously don‚Äôt believe me when I tell them and think something is off with me lol. I do love to binge watch series and I always thought it‚Äôs because the story line isn‚Äôt as predictable as for most movies, at least to me. Also I don‚Äôt like a lot of movies who are about things that in true life never could happen, that bothers me for some reason.   
I think it has more to do with movies trying to fit a story into less than 2 hours. It's usually rushed  
Nevermind movies, sometimes a full 40-50 minute episode seems too long, so I end up watching a bunch of 20 minute sitcom episodes in a row instead.  
The worst of all are long pilots.  Way to kill off a potential audience.  
Exception to this rule: Firefly.  
These days 2 hours is about all I can allocate on a given day for TV, movies, or games. I end up watching a lot of movies or 50 minute TV episodes across two days.  
It seems like a commitment issue. You can prepare to spend an hour and a half watching or film but after 2-3 episodes or YouTube videos you can easily turn off.   
Woah. Look at this guy over here. He can easily escape youtube. Tell us your secret.   
Pretty easy when the youtube algorithm fills my feed with all kind of shit that i have no interest in. Honestly i feel like it was way better back in the day  
There‚Äôs a chrome extension that removes ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù videos from appearing on your home page  
There‚Äôs so much garbage on YouTube that I think it‚Äôs easier to escape it then get sucked in in the first place.  
https://youtu.be/yKC6XmsLWVQ?t=93  
This. It‚Äôs your ‚Äúchoice‚Äù to keep watching whereas with a movie you HAVE to.   
That‚Äôs how I see it. For me, with TV the plot is contained within 30-60minutes, and I have time between episodes for my brain to take a break.   
My boyfriend is like this and it drives me crazy. I‚Äôll suggest a movie to watch, and he never wants to because ‚Äúit‚Äôs too long‚Äù but then he‚Äôll sit on the couch next to me watching random stuff for 4 hours.  I‚Äôve fully embraced my laziness.  
Does he randomly walk in on you watching a movie and want to change it to a show instead so he can sit there on his phone half watching it instead of just sitting there doing the same thing with YOUR movie on instead?  Run-on sentence behold! My SO does this and it's quite upsetting lol.  
ugh yes all the time.  with movies you gotta concentrate more though  
That's it for me. I don't want to have to focus, so TV is usually something you can blur through an episode and get by, but 20-30 minutes missing from a movie ruins it completely.   
And you can get stuff done in between shows. You can make dinner and then watch a show while eating, finish your show and then clean up a bit, watch another, get ready for bed in between the end of that show and the next, etc.   
Always.  I can't recall the last time I voluntarily sat down to watch a film, but I'll spend an entire day binging seasons of a TV show. I don't like committing the mass of emotional energy a (good) movie requires in one sitting.  Sort of makes me a bit anxious, really.  Perhaps it is due to having my soul scraped away daily as a server, but when I'm home, I want the easier emotional build-up of a show - and the greater story/character depth.  Plus, I get too invested in characters and then I'm pissed when the movie is over.  
Maybe it's because in movies, there's only about 2 hours to complete a story and things develop faster. The reason i love TV shows is because the best kind slowly develop and they're so much more rewarding when a story arch is coming to an end compared to movies. We invest time into these shows which results in caring a lot more about the main characters because we've spent so much time with them.  I started Counterpart last week and already i care so much about Howard Silk(s).  
I rarely watch movies because of that reason. Mostly because i want to watch the entire movie in one sitting but i know that i have to do something more important in less than 2 hours and dont wanna pause  
I am literally the opposite. I don't like watching any movie less than 90 minutes long. It feels like I am being cheated out of what used to be an average of 2 hours long as a child.  I am all for longer content. Shout out to Scorsese, Paul Thomas Anderson, and The Coens.  
A new movie I definitely want to have the whole time uninterrupted. But sometimes I like to "watch" something I've already seen, so I can do something else and listen and still know what's going on, and then I can actually watch when I know a good part is coming.  
This is a nightly argument at my house between me and my wife. Every night.  
Watching The Office on Netflix proves this theory  
Every single day  
I'm glad I'm not the only one. I only ever watch YouTube and series.   
Before movies it started with cable television for me. I lost patience with the bombardment of advertisements every 5 min back in 2009. Then I lost patience for most all movies, which I attributed to the lack of originality in Hollywood these days. (Non stop comic book movies) Now a days I tend to fall asleep, a problem I don‚Äôt have as much with documentaries which hold my interest better.  
I never watch movies for this reason. Watching YouTube or Crunchyroll or Netflix, whatever is easy. I can stop after one episode if that's what Im feeling.  But with a movie it's like "okay Im going to be sitting here for an hour and a half or two hours or whatever and...you can stop, sure. But then whats the point of starting the movie at all?   
I'm the exact opposite.  I'll watch 2 movies in a day, but 10 episodes in a day?  Never.  Not even half that.  
Is it something new vs something comfortable? I find myself re-watching something comfortable, rather than being exposed to new media.   
I am just the opposite - I usually only watch movies as I know if it‚Äôs a good show, it will be a huge time suck.  
My so and I have had this ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù so many times! He insists that watching a tv show takes too much time . I insist that watching a movie is just too much of a time suck for me.  My thoughts are with tv I can always opt to stop watching after an episode (30-60 min) and then pick up the story later on when I‚Äôm ready to be lazy. I don‚Äôt have to worry about pausing to go to the bathroom, losing interest, or getting 60+ minutes in and then deciding I‚Äôm bored.  He claims that with a movie he can get fully immersed in a fantasy world for a couple of hours and then be done. He doesn‚Äôt have to wait for multiple episodes to see a resolution, or give up 10+ hours to watch a whole season in one binge.  So instead we trade off. One weekend we watch a movie or two of his choice and he listens to me whine occasionally about being bored. The next weekend we watch 3-6 episodes of something I want and he complains about wasting time.   
Yaaaasssssss. I do this a lot and I think it's because of youtube. My husband loves movies and shows. He likes plots and good story telling and the like. The genres tend to be all over the place. Me? I'm used to just kicking on youtube in the background while doing chores or playing video games, and next thing I know i've binged watch yet another drama llama channel. And youtube I can have IN THE BACKGROUND. Same with certain food network shows on hulu, but it's mainly youtube. I don't have to pay attention to the visuals or anything of the sort. I kinda have to force myself through the first 30 minutes or so of a movie, and next thing I know it's over. But there's something about the time commitment and overall commitment that feels so overwhelming.  
I do this because with most movies, I haven‚Äôt seen them yet and I have to pay attention to them, otherwise I won‚Äôt get it. With most tv shows, I may have already seen the show and just putting it on for background noise. So I don‚Äôt have to actually watch it.  However if I‚Äôm in the mood to actually sit and watch something, then a movie isn‚Äôt a bad idea.   
I think it's the opposite, it's because movies are too short. They are the short stories of the screen world, tv shows are the full-length books. In movies everything is always kinda heavy handed, every scene MEANS something, the movie makers often want to leave you wondering (fuck off), you never get to spend long enough with the characters. Since great TV became a thing (The Sopranos, The Wire, Six Feet Under etc etc) I'll take a tv show any day over a movie.  
Having adhd is classic for this. I can‚Äôt sit and watch a movie, but I can watch an entire series in a day and not bat an eye. I‚Äôm pretty sure this is called being hyper focused because it‚Äôs something I am interested in.  
For me it's more of a quality issue. It seems like tv series are just so much better written anymore. They intentionally cram long car chase scenes, fight scened and shootouts into action/drama movies.  I just feel like the talent is in the series. Give me Breaking Bad, Mad Men, The Office, The Americans or Goliath over another Matrix or that Matt Damon series or the latest Tom Cruise fiasco. My two cents...  
It‚Äôs because those things are designed fundamentally different. Movies are written for 2 hours, while a tv Show is written for 20-30 minutes. A tv Show is more attention grabbing and you‚Äôre able to watch more, because it starts and finishes a story arc in 1/4 the time that a movie does. Which is probably preferable for people with shorter attention spans for watching things.  Example: I watched an entire season of New Girl In one sitting one time, but fell asleep 30 minutes into captain marvel  
I do this with reading. I can't be bothered to read a book because of the time it would take, then I spend hours reading Reddit posts/comments and articles online. I don't get it. Brains are weird.  
I hate committing to 90mins, but I'll happily binge 45min programmes, psychology of being able to stop at any time and pick it back up I guess...I don't know   
Even though I might watch tv for a longer time period than a movie would last, the movie is a longer time commitment because I'm committed for the duration of the movie which is longer than each individual tv episode. It sounds silly because most people are smart enough that if they do not enjoy a movie then they will change to something else. I am the kind of person who commits to a movie once I start watching even if it's not great.  
I don't watch TV or movies because I can't commit to just sitting down that long, but I'll spend hours browsing the interwebs.  
100% me. Can easily spend a weekend on reddit and youtube. But the thought of committing to watching the same thing for 3 hours makes me fidgety.   
I do this but with youtube. I think, "I wanna watch a movie.." *looks at time* "Nah, it's too late." Then I go off doing other things that are less entertaining for 5-ish hours   
Yes, but it works the other way around too. If I want to spend time with my boyfriend, I want to watch a movie because that way he's committed to me for atleast that time. If we watch a show, I'm scared he's not gonna want to watch the next episode and our cozy-time is cut short!  
Oof I‚Äôm sorry. That‚Äôs really sad.  
How is it sad? I didn't mean he would run away from me or doesn't like hanging out, just that he would get tired of the show or something. But if you don't like a movie, you usually still pull through.  
Ahh gotcha. Sounded like he was tryna run. Glad that‚Äôs not the case.  
I have always felt the same way!! I can sit and easily watch TV for hours and hours on end but movies are always so boring. It‚Äôs so hard trying to tell people you don‚Äôt want to see a movie just because you get bored lol  
I never would have thought that anyone else experiences this.   
90 Minutes? Movies made in the last 10 years are almost all 2 hours minimum.   
But there were movies made before that too.  
Bullshit. You can't believe everything you read on the world wide web, man.  
True.  
I want to watch game of thrones but my add will not allow me to sit through 1 hour of shows thats why i watch anime cause there only 15-20 minutes  
I'm the exact opposite  
I tend not to watch movies that are being aired because I can not pause them for later viewing.  
So true! If I do watch movies, they have to be short.   I perfer TV , Netflix and YouTube.  
10 hours?!? Nah. I can't do that, no way.  
My sister is just like this  
I have that same problem  
Only if the TV show episodes are 20-30 because 40+ is too big a commitment as well lol.  
feels like 30+30 < 6  
Yes! I was actually talking about this with my friends over lunch (bit in my case, instead of a movie, I pit on a series and watch several episodes). Nobody seems to have  the same opinion though!  
Yes  
Honestly for me its about story. Ever since i got into the wonderful world of binging a TV series, I tend to not watch movies. However, every now and then I'll go to a movie playing in theaters.  
With movies I feel like not enough happens in them and they drag in out for 1hr30 or longer. A lot of the time they are so predictable too. But with TV shows I get hooked.  Its not an attention thing for me because I can easily watch several episodes of GoT for example in a row.  
Meeee! The thing is the action happens faster in 40 minutes of an episode, than in a 2 hour movie. By the time the movie gets exciting I'm asleep.  
I'm the opposite! I can't commit to watching a television show with more than 2 seasons but I can easily watch like 5 movies in one sitting.  
I used to do this... Then I realized I can just stop watching the movie and start it up again. My husband doesn't understand how I can watch 30-45mins of a movie one night and continue it the next night. I just can. But then again I'm good at remembering plot points and he isn't. So...  
I've "discovered" similar. I used to think like your husband such that I'd have to finish the entire movie in one sitting, even if it was terrible and going nowhere (always hopeful that there'd be some big redemption turnaround coming....eventually, and most often there just isn't). Now, I'll just stop it at some breakpoint and pick it up the next day or two later. After you see enough movies, there's inevitably some superfluous character development scene(s), that I'd likely just FF through anyway, which usually work as reasonable stopping points. Also helps to treat it as a continuous plot TV series where you just watched episode 1 and will pick up episodes 2+ later on. With today's streaming tech it really does make it much easier to do.  
nope  Pretty much the opposite of what you said  
Yep. The same way I can watch a 20 minute vlog of someone's life on youtube but when a friend sends me a video longer than 2 minutes I'm like no way am I watching this long ass video!!  
I‚Äôm actually this in reverse. Movies are one and done but tv shows are too much of a commitment for me.  
It‚Äôs not that crazy.   It‚Äôs not just about time; in a movie you‚Äôre committing to a whole story arc, which takes more emotional investment.   Just one episode of a show is less emotional commitment, but then by starting it you want to keep going.    
It's like the difference between moving in with a partner, and sleeping over. One of them requires commitment and planning, the other can be cut short if needed i guess this is a commitment anxiety issue  
When It comes to movies, 90 minutes is too short.   
Kind of. I don't want to watch 2 hour movies, but I'll watch maybe 3 90 minute movies in one sitting.  
For me, I can't watch movies because it's not enough commitment. It takes a while to figure out what I want to watch, so I don't want to have to decide again in a couple of hours. When I pick a show, I know I don't have to pick again for days or weeks.  
Yeah, the other day I turned off Candyman (too many jump scares), despite being almost halfway into it, and then proceeded to binge Star Trek: Enterprise: two seasons done in a week.  
I‚Äôll usually scroll through movies on Netflix or Amazon Prime forever and then never pick one. My thought process is usually, ‚ÄúI kind of want to see that, but what if I don‚Äôt like it? There could be another one that I‚Äôll like more.‚Äù How does that even make sense? So just stop watching it if you don‚Äôt like it!! I love movies, but at home I watch way more TV shows and it‚Äôs easier for me to pick one and start watching.   
Not with movies (b/c I love them) but with YouTube videos over an hour. I see a video from a YouTuber I like that's over an hour, and I think "it's too long, and a waste if time." But I go on to watch 1-2 hours worth of YouTube videos in one sitting.   
No.  But, yes.  I don't know.  I like Jello.  
Me asf ! I can watch Hulu all fucking dat but throw some Netflix and and try to sit me in front of a movie uh uh noooo !  
Nah. I'm quicker to just not finish a movie, write down my time and resume later. I don't really like TV shows for your exact reason. I don't want to be invested in a bunch of TV shows. That shit's time consuming. A 90 minute movie tells me a whole story beginning to end (most movies anyway). 90 minutes compared to binge watching a season of something...that's how I view it. I also just don't actively watch a lot of repeats on TV. Reno 911 is funny as hell though...I'd put that on for background noise if I saw it and I was scrolling.  
I wont watch a movie unless its 100+ mins. A movie cant tell a good story in under 2hrs really.   
This is my ex to a T. It drove me nuts. Can't watch our favorite movies but 4 hours of Mind Hunter or Criminal Minds, ezpz  
I'm the same way. 90 minutes isn't enough time to get me to care about a character and their story, which is why I prefer tv shows. I can have seasons of character and plot development. 90 minutes is a lot of time to waste on nothing.   
YES. Story of my life.   
I never realized how much I do this. Wow.  
My wife will literally say ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt commit to that‚Äù on a movie that‚Äôs 1hr 40 mins. Then she‚Äôll watch 5 episodes of unsolved mysteries in a row...  Her logic is the unsolved mystery, at this point.   
Not at all, I get bored of TV by the time half hour passes.  
I‚Äôm the opposite lmao.   
Yes. Have ADHD, so I need to move around regularly or I'll go insane. Last time I went to a theatre, sitting in the seat the whole time drove me insane, but I didn't want to miss the movie. On my own, I'll pause it a bunch to go blow off some energy and return to it. The difference with stuff like TV shows or YT videos is that the content is in shorter chunks, so while I'm still taking breaks, the breaks are built in (especially if there are commercials) and way less jarring.  
I always multitask and do something else when watching television, whereas I few like a movie demands more attention from me. This is why I tend to binge watch tv shows, because if I miss a moment it doesn‚Äôt matter as much as missing something from a film.  
I can't get myself to watch a 45 minute tv show, but will binge the fuck out on a 22 minute tv show.  
The chance of me enjoying a movie is small so I rarely watch movies. For me it's because I sometimes don't remember what everybody looks like since a movie is only 2 hours. Usually I prefer watching 2 hours of youtube videos over a 2 hour movie because I feel those videos contain more content for the same amount of time.  I usually prefer TV shows over movies because tv shows have more established characters and have more time for complex plots so pacing feels better  
https://boxd.it/1Bb9M  This person made a list of good movies under 100 min.  
Yes!  I have done this for years.  I have always been a TV junkie and I will watch movies, but I have to KNOW they are fantastic before I'll spend 90+ minutes on them.  Maybe it's the ADHD, but the commitment to an episode is so much less daunting.  Plus, I enjoy being able to come back for more.  Even if its an amazing movie, when it's over, it's over.  (Let's be honest, very few sequels measure up.)  I even have a bit of separation anxiety when I wrap up the last episode of something.  Those were my friends!  I also will spend an hour or more browsing all my streaming services because I don't want to dedicate 23 minutes to a show that might suck.    
Oh my god I thought I was the only one! My friends give me so much shit for this, you‚Äôre not alone OP!   
Oh my god, i'm not alone  
This is me with youtube. Movies always feel so long and i never really want to watch them unless its in theatres and looks like a good movie, but i will easily sit down and watch hours worth of 5-10 minute videos. Unfortunately, realizing you watched 2 hours straight of youtube makes you feel like an idiot. So thats a con.  
i do this but bc like, a movie is 90 minutes, one whole story. you have to care the whole time, fully. whereas with tv shows you can kinda go in and out at least a little, AND as an added bonus you get way more entertainment time out of if.  
I did that tonight.  
Okay, real glad I‚Äôm not the only one. However, I still attempt to watch movies but I tend to watch them in 20-45 minute segments at a time. I still don‚Äôt get through movies as often as I do with TV shows though.   
It's really not a paradox. You're just packing the self focus   
I feel like hour long tv shows on Netflix is way too long to sit though.  
Yes, and we're the same people who would neeever eat a big slice of cake, no no, but maybe just one cookie that will definitely turn into 47 cookies.   
This is my life. Bang on.  
YESSS, my girlfriend HATES this about me hahaha  
This is me!! I‚Äôm scared that It‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt want the emotional investment of a whole movie that I know I won‚Äôt be able to stop once I start it  
Yes! I can't watch a movie for the life of me, my attention span dies after 5 minutes! But I can watch tv series episode after episode.   
poop/snack factor...  
Not at all. I don‚Äôt really do binge-watching for the most part; it‚Äôs unnatural for me. I feel that I enjoy movies more than series. Although there are a few great shows out there, television has declined heavily since the 90‚Äôs IMO  
No  
I feel the same way about 20 minute shows vs like 45-50 min ones  
With very little free time these days and so many content options you can take short cuts everywhere. For movies you can just skip thru them the whole way to save time. For series you can watch the first and last episodes for each season or skip around a bit if it's really interesting. For Youtube you can download a plugin to change the speed and watch things at 1.75x - 3.5x depending on how clear the speech is.   
I just watched almost 5 hours of Joe Rogan and Alex Jones latest podcast. Zero regrets.  
I actually hate when a movie on Netflix looks like it'll be good but it's says it'll only be 90 minutes and I want it to be 3hrs.  
8 always press the 8 instead of an 8.  
You made ne do the thing!

It depends on how bad the typo is.  Like sometimes you have to, just to try to figure out how in the hell they screwed up the word.  
It‚Äôs ether dyslexia, a second language, a kid, someone who hasn‚Äôt seen the word much on paper (those rules are really inconsistent. It is one of the hardest languages on earth.) Anyways Dyslexia will have to stare at a kids juice box wondering why your eyes can‚Äôt unsee the word bitch, even though you know it‚Äôs wrong. Never put anything past dyslexia. Especially since many people go undiagnosed and un aided.  
What does the juice box part mean??  
It‚Äôs just an example of something that has words on it but that definitely doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúbitch‚Äù  
And temporarily judges harshly when the letter is not near the correct letter, like what happened there?  
like- how did ya manage to do THAT  
yes lol  
i thought the slang term ‚Äúfinna‚Äù came from someone making a typo when trying to say ‚Äúgonna‚Äù and it just stuck.  
This is actually just a relaxed pronunciation of ‚Äúfixing to‚Äù, the same way ‚Äògonna‚Äô is ‚Äúgoing to‚Äù, ‚Äògotta‚Äô is ‚Äúgot to‚Äù, etc. Edit: semantics.  
Actually it‚Äôs closer to ‚Äòfixing to‚Äô it has the same use as gonna, except it‚Äôs that you‚Äôre about to do it instead of I‚Äôm ‚Äògonna do that right now‚Äô.  Eg: I‚Äôm finna go to the bathroom  
Ah yes, you are correct. Thanks for catching that for me!  
I thought it was from T9 texting with flip phones where you pressed the number correlating with the letter and the phone guesses what you meant. Every time I used to say gonna, it thought I was trying to say finna because it was close to the same numbers used for gonna.  
(laughs in Dvorak)  
(raughs back)  
rit en AZERTY  
I see what pou did there.  
If it's pretty far away, i'd be like "Your finger's not THAT fat."  
Yes, I've developed a habit of almost always doing it now sadly!  
I was reading some political article about something-or-other and I saw (what I thought was) a recurring typo; Latinx. It was throughout the article, so my first thought was that the author (or editor?) may have improperly executed a 'Find and Replace' to have ended up with this, but a quick Google search for 'Latinx' ended up in a TIL. Latinx = a gender-neutral americanization of the Spanish words Latino/Latina = Spanglified  
All the timr!  
People look at their keyboard?  
i always do this  
No. Sometimes my typos aren‚Äôt because the letters are next to each other, it‚Äôs more like I got some wires crossed in my brain.  
I do this with the words from and form, whenever I mean to type from I type form and whenever I mean to type form I type from. It‚Äôs like I have a specific condition that only affects those 2 words.  When I finish an assignment I‚Äôll do my references, a spellcheck and then search those 2 words specifically because I KNOW I‚Äôve typed them out of context.  
Sounds like dyslexia  
Your brain can have an occasional goof without it being dyslexia.  
Nah, it‚Äôs just making a mistake. I don‚Äôt have dyslexia. I did great in school and scored in the 99% percentile on the ACT.  
Dyslexia isn‚Äôt a measure of intelligence. Also what was said was crossed wiring. A common was dyslexia is described by both dyslexics and Doctors.  
Making occasional mistakes isn‚Äôt dyslexia. If it was frequent or a problem for me then sure maybe.  Edit to add: I‚Äôm not implying that it‚Äôs a measure of intelligence. I‚Äôm just saying that if I went my entire life with undiagnosed dyslexia it‚Äôs pretty likely it would‚Äôve affected how I did in school. And I don‚Äôt even think school is necessarily a measure of intelligence.  
Yes! I thought I was alone!  
Nope.  Never but that‚Äôs funny  
Well thank you. Now I will.  
Yes! Because I do this a lot I just expect others make the same mistake too so it's an auto response  
What if they use a different layout keyboard?  
QWERTY 4 lyfe.  
I used to be way harsher about spelling mistakes until I met my partner, who is dyslexic and also one of the smartest people I know.  
Every time!!  
Yeah, I was thinking about that a year ago when someone posted this very same question almost verbatim.  Well done, OP.  
[deleted]  
I KNEW it!  
My favorite is when they‚Äôre holding shift while entering a phone number, I just swap it out for the number that correlates with the symbol and BOOM I have them on the phone.  
Everytome  
Yes lmao  
Shit yes. Same for when I see English gibberish when one trys to type in their native tounge and forgets to change keyboard language. I see what letter is next to each key and try to read it anyway  
All the time  
Yes. I am a positionally challenged touch typer.  
Honestly this is how i thought "finna" originated because the letters line up with "gonna" and i had been making that typo occasionally for years  
No, but memorizing the keyboard might save you time so you don‚Äôt have to look at a keyboard every typo. I really hope I don‚Äôt start doing this to typos now.  
Yes, so I can decide if I want to let the typo slide or remember it forever.  
I also read it back for phonetic miss spelling, as someone who pretty much always uses voice to text for typing  
Yes! Like I can forgive you if it‚Äôs a close mistake but if not...üòê  
Sometimes  
One of the best office pranks is swapping the M and N keys on a keyboard, best part is it only affects the hunt and peck people.  
Yeah. I like to see if someone fat-fingered the typo, or if they're just dumb.  
And if the letters are close together I forgive them of their error. If they are no where near each other I judge them accordingly. lol  
Lol. Yeah I guess I‚Äôve done it before.  
relevant xkcd  
Not since I starhed using thj Dvorak kefboard  
I do  
Every time. It's a fun little game.  
I absolutely do. But I also attribute it the majority of people on mobile.  
YESSS especially when I'm trying to figure out if it's some wired slang or the word I'm thinking of  
No, because i know where all the jeys are feom memory  
Yes. Every single time. And sometimes it's nowhere near. What is up with that?  
But why look down? We already know where all the keys are.  
I don't. I know if they are lmao  
Oooooh omg yes.  
Yess  
Guilty  
Yes- every time  
Every.single.time  
O alqays do thus lol  
Yes. Other people use basic problem solving skills. It isn't just you.  
Yed  
Yes a lot  
DAE not because they already know what a keyboard looks like?  
Now I will always do this  
Sometimes yes, all other times I am like wtf  
Yep. Usually a good yet subtle indicator the girl you're texting with, has found someone more interesting. It's a small thing, and it's never wise to assume, but i have enough self respect to tell someone that if they can't properly write with the QWERTY keyboard provided with them on their phone and use proper grammar and punctuation, they aren't intelligent enough to be dating to begin with. This whole "OMG so Mary's BFF went down to the P.A.R.K. w her gf n dey had jst da best tim" crap might've flown with T9, but phones have full keyboards now.  
Or maybe she's become so comfortable around you that she relaxes while typing and it was actually a subtle indicator she's into you.  
It can go either or, if we're being real. Love is hard. You're either damned if you do, or damned if you don't, but I digress. I typically use such an attribute as a filter for the friendzone; I won't outright end a conversation unless someone is talking in my aforementioned example, but you have the power of Google in the palm of your hand-- a literal dictionary, thesaurus, all of the tools needed to write like a champ. I'm no Harvard student Rick Sanchez traveling the infinite cosmos with a portal gun, but I know I'm intelligent enough to know how to properly respond to your comment.  If you can't take a moment to make sure the word you're typing is spelled right, how can I expect you to do something even simpler than that? That's just me though, I'm single for good reason, so there's that. Edit: yeah I revisited this just to make this edit. That is possibly, after having read it more than twice, the DUMBEST way for a woman to show a man she's into him. No wonder everybody on this planet is so stupid. Unintelligent writing makes everybody hot and squirty, the blind leading the blind. Why would you even suggest that using improper spelling and punctuation is a means of showing someone your guard is down, and you're into them? The answer will be better than the question, considering it'll never come. But now every horny 12 year old whose potential partner accidentally mistypes "hanging down by the dock" is gonna cream their pants. Let's just cut educational funding while we're at it, considering the only thing the next generation is gonna be good for is jacking off while flipping a light switch. That is harder than it sounds, by the way. No pun intended.  
Yep! Lol I imagined them in a little office under the street with switches to control their intersection. I imagined one person at each intersection.  I‚Äôd forgot about this! Thanks for a laugh!  
I imagined them being controlled by some fat guy sitting in a small shack type of building out in the middle of the desert.  
My guy was fat too!  
Does you guy have glasses too?  
I don‚Äôt remember but he probably did. He was fat and balding and he ate snacks while on the job.  
Did he sometimes spill mustard on his shirt and not bother to clean it up?  
I thought they had scales under each intersection judging how many cars were waiting by the weight. Once one side got heavy enough, they got to go. I like yours better though lol  
That's actually not that far off. The streets basically have magnets to tell how many cars have passed so they know when to switch the lights. There is also timers and such but that's a very simplified explanation.  
TIL I wasn‚Äôt as dumb as I thought about the marvels or civil engineering haha! Thanks for the info!! I guess I just assumed that everything was pretty much on timers...I can time down to almost the minute when lights on my route to work will turn green depending on time of day (and emergency vehicles). I‚Äôd never heard of the magnet thing though!  
According to my dad (civil engineer) it depends where you live. Most all lights have a combination timer and sensor and which one is prioritized depends on location and time of day and traffic load. If you're approaching a light, look in the street for a metal plate, about 5x5" usually anywhere between a cars length and a few cars length behind the line. That's the sensor. I can't not see them now. He told me back when I started driving that If you roll over it too slow or too fast it sometimes won't pick up your car, so if it's the middle of the night and light wont change try backing up and going forward again.  
Have you ever noticed late at night if you‚Äôre coming up on a red light, it changes fast?  
I thought the same! And at night (in the nearby small town) that was why it switched to a flashing red light for one direction and flashing yellow for the other. Like they had folks working 1st and 2nd shift, but switched to auto-flashing mode for 3rd shift.  
Dude same!!  
Somehow I thought people were in the lights at the intersection controlling them  
Same! My older brother was very tall and slender when I was little and I remember thinking how he would be a perfect candidate for a job working in the light poles, haha.  
Yes! I also thought they were in the light poles and always wondered if they were dwarves.  
^^^^^^^!!!!  
I still believe this and I fully believe that those bastards working the lights  are my enemies.  
I still think that  
I used to and my ex actually believed it still and he was 20. He also thought the orange bumpy strips by crosswalks were weight sensors to signal for the crosswalk sign.  
that‚Äôs.... that‚Äôs not what those are for?  
[deleted]  
Leg disabled  
Acid  
They're for blind people so they can feel where the ramp is and know not to walk into the street.  
Yeah I used to think the same thing Then came to your realization Then I saw this and realized that it is the case sometimes.  https://youtu.be/kbLxyefk3sU  
In my city some of the traffic stops are manually controlled by the traffic police. There's a panel with a bunch of buttons which the cops used to press that changed the signals. Not many are manually controlled but the one I went past while going to school was because it was an important road in the city and it connected a lot of hospitals, so a lot of ambulances.  
Okay but does anybody know how they actually work tho-  
Depends on the signal. Some are simply a matter of time and the cars that come and go do not make a difference at all. Most have either cameras or in road detection to detect when a car approaches a signal. There's a controller inside a cabinet (every signal has a cabinet nearby) and that is programed by a signal operator/technician. This way, the signal timing continuously adjusts and changes depending on the amount of cars, from which directions, and the time of day.  
Are you trying to tell me that they don't?  
Fun fact: outside Ambulance stations in VIC Australia, they are. It‚Äôs Supposed to be to let the Ambos out quick... While doing a clinical placement there we played ‚Äúspot the bloke in a hurry‚Äù and changed the lights to red... I finished in third outta 5... 4th and 5th got called out on a long job. I put it down to not having enough experience or practical knowledge in my post-placement interview.  
I‚Äôm going to be honest I only understood about 40% of this comment. Everything after clinical placement is a wash  
5 y-o me used to think someone would turn on the lampposts manually and I was always mad that I never got to see that person light them on. I would see the lights be on and be like "damn it. He got me again".  
Haha yeah. I remember thinking that there was just a man with screens all around him and a bunch of buttons and I stand by that, there's 100% a man controlling everything  
Yes, because of that scene in the Italian Job!  
I thought that about auto flush toilets. They always scared me because I thought someone was behind the wall watching through the little sensor. So creepy.  
Hahaa omg! I totally forgot about that! It wasn‚Äôt until my grandfather (mechanic/electrician) explained to me how sensors work and as an example he gave traffic lights that I knew the truth  
My parents told me that if I ‚Äúblew on them‚Äù they would change faster so for the longest time we would all sit at different intersections blowing to ‚Äúget the light to change‚Äù üò≠  
When I was really young, I thought there were people INSIDE the traffic lights controlling them.  
Haha I forgot about this, but I was totally one of those kids.  
It's STILL that way right...!?!?  
Hahaha same here! I haven‚Äôt thought about that in forever lol  
They‚Äôre... not?  
This is the same vibe of me thinking that every song on the radio was the band performing it live when I was young  
Ah there's no feeling that compares to when randomly encountering a post on this sub and realising nothing you thought as a kid was unique or special.  
yes but I only just realised this now  
Laughing at how long you wait till it turns green.  
You mean they don't?  
Some adults think that.  There was some traffic lights near my house and one man would always toot his horn when he got to the red traffic light.  
I used to think that the clicking sound the car's blinker made meant that my dad was wirelessly paying some kind of 1 cent toll fee to the passing telephone poles. Click click click meant that it was processing and the clunk of the turn signal switch going back meant the payment was completed.  
I think so. That's going back a long time. I also thought that it was controlled by pressure plates under the road. And later I thought that they were supposed to be programmed such that if you got a green light and drove the speed limit you would not hit a red one. Not sure how I ever thought that, but I did. I was a freer spirit in those days.  
No. From studying them and the cross signals, I determined they were on a timer. I was a kid before they had all the fancy magnet or weight sensors, so they really were on timers. Nowadays I notice I can zip through an intersection if I can hit the sensor before it exits the window to change to yellow then red.  
I read recently that some city got approved for an AI light system. Can‚Äôt wait to not sit at a red light when there‚Äôs no oncoming traffic.  
Definitely did.  
I relate to this.  
Haha yes. A lot of memories came back, thanks!  
I use to think this about commercials, like somebody was just waiting for the second the cartoon cut to commercial to press a button to pick which commercial aired. I pictured a big desk control panel with a ton of buttons. When the screen would sometimes go black and the commercial was delayed a couple seconds I would think the button guy got distracted  
I used to think that everything on TV and movies in the theaters were played through VHS tapes like how I would watch all my movies at home so my thought was that VHS was the only way to play and watch anything and everything. I always imagined some nerdy guy at a television station running up to a VCR that ran the channel‚Äôs broadcasts and changing tapes for commercials and he had to do it the exact second the commercial ended and somehow did.  
Yes. I imagined a huge building full of wires. Like a skyscraper filled with only wires that were connected to them. And i always wondered where the ppl who controlled them would still and watch. I pictured a guy sitting tangled in wires basically lmaoooo  
Omg yes! I thought the same with commercials lmao I thought someone was watching every channel in a tiny room, choosing when to send them to break, and choosing which channels got which commercials  
Did? I still do! Hahaha  
This isn‚Äôt happening?  
Are you telling me they‚Äôre not?  
Yeah, I used to imagine every town/city had their ‚Äúlights control center‚Äù where a shit ton of people monitored the intersections.  How did I forget about this?!?!  
Yes absolutely  
Wait, it‚Äôs not?  
Not even once.  
Wait, they don't?!  
My dream job.  
This post reminds me of the ending of the movie Me, You and Everyone We Know by Miranda July. You should check it out! It changed my life.  
I used to think there were people in helicopters, controlling the lights with a remote. They would look down and assess which side of the street had more cars and allow them to go to dwindle traffic while the others waited. And then I figured out that that was not the case ... not at all.  
I thought they sat in the big boxes usually next to the lights. I actually wanted that job for a while.  
Yeeeees! Though my dad also told me they were operated by traffic elves that lived in the lights  
Yes and I still don't understand how they work  
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT TOO!!!  
Yes, I sure did!!!  
When I was about 6 I used to think the bands sat around at the radio station all day waiting to take their turn to play on the radio.  
Actually I used to imagine there were tiny goblin creatures living within the stop light itself... Edit to add: There were good goblins that would turn the light green before I got there and the evil goblins that would turn it red to make me wait.  
Yeah, i thought that along with the thinking that there was one street light with a huge swich that people took turns pulling to turn on the street lights at night.  
Wouldn't rule it out  I bought a Chinese robot vacuum and I'm convinced its being controlled via some distant remote control centre / foreign surveillance  Its just way too accurate for what it cost and I left my office workpapers on the floor once and I swear it was lingering around them for too long pretty shady stuff  
I have thought that. I also thought something similar with commercials that there was some dude for each channel with a giant monitor and tons of buttons. Each button was a different commercial and when the same one would keep playing over and over I would think man that guy really likes this commercial  
i still think that even though i know its not the case. when i see some light patterns that make no sense or gives very few seconds for pedestrians to cross i always think "fucking asshole messing with the lights man"  
Hell yeah lol  
Yesterday, while driving on a newly resurfaced road,there seemed to be a programming error on the traffic light sequence. The main thoroughfare lights stayed green for about 14 or 15 seconds. The cross street lights stayed green for about a minute. There are 8 lights in about 2.5 miles. It was a disaster. Thankfully it got fixed before I made the return trip about 20 minutes later. (I know this doesn't really answer your question, but I had to rant about it.)  
I didn't actually think that but yk them big electrical boxes you sometimes see workers doing stuff tp them? I used to think each night someone had to go tp them and switch the traffic lights on  
No. But I thought my cockatiel got up each morning to put on blush.  
No, but if that's true I need to have a word with someone about the lights at Admiral and Yale, Tulsa, Oklahoma.  
Most definitely!! And I also used to think that traffic signs were made by a Santa Claus looking type kind of dude who hand painted them. I haven‚Äôt thought about that in years! Thanks for the memory lane stroll.  
You mean...its not?  
I thought there were tiny alien people inside the lights pushing buttons lol  
Absolutely! And by ‚Äòused to think‚Äô are you inferring that they‚Äôre not?  
I did  
Not unlike that RnM episode where Summer "Clive Barkers herself" I thought they were controlled by operators hanging out under the intersections lmfao Edit: spacing  
Then I found one where that was happening! At an intersection on a very steep hill in San Francisco, with cable cars also going along the street. Like magic!  
Wait... It's not?  
YES! It‚Äôs crazy what our little brains come up with lol  
They don't?!?!?!  üòÖ Jkjk  
I convinced my daughter that I controlled the stop lights. I'd look at the opposing lights and when it turned yellow, I'd close my eyes really tight and say "1, 2, 3, turn... GREEN. Typically worked and my daughter thought I was magic. She hasn't believed that for a couple of years but I'll still pretend sometimes, just to make her roll her eyes.  
I thought there were people literally inside of the traffic light making all of the decisions ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  
Wait.  It's not?  
Wait they aren‚Äôt?! Well there goes my childhood  
When I was little and my parents would drive on the highway when it was dark out, I used to think of the headlights of oncoming cars as glowing angels and the brake lights of the cars ahead of us as glowing demons. Every drive in traffic was an epic battle between good and evil with the angels and demons rushing past eachother further into the battle. Luckily I was young and oblivious enough to not think about the fact we were always on the side of the red lights....  
Still think that they're timed to piss us off lol  
Wait....it isn't?  
I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE Except that the people were in the stop lights themselves  
Well not anymore  
I thought they were in that little box by the road  
YES! I‚Äôd think Gee They must be so tired  
I used to think it was controlled by monkeys in the lights lol how dumb.  
I used to think it Was controlled by monkeys in The lights lol how dumb. - ksunshine19  I detect haikus. And sometimes, successfully. Learn more about me. Opt out of replies: "haikusbot opt out" | Delete my comment: "haikusbot delete"  
Omg yes, I fully believed there was a small room under each light that someone worked in.  
Oh my god yes?  
I always thought that there were mini pixie sized humans in there that would control them  
Lol exactly this just like the old telephone centers  
Yeah!  Used to also think we were the only ones driving a car. All other cars were moved by wind of course  
No. But I was a smart kid.  
my mom made fun of me when i told her that‚Äôs what i thought  
This is actually called something! It‚Äôs called ‚Äúrevenge bedtime procrastination.‚Äù You‚Äôre definitely not alone when it comes to this  
Yeah, I do the same though I hate the wording for that phrase because it sounds like I‚Äôm mad about it, LOL. I‚Äôm more of a night owl but my schedule is in conflict with that due to various responsibilities.  
Sameeee I hate the ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù part of it like who am I exacting my revenge on? I‚Äôm just procrastinating my bedtime  
I call it self sabotage.  
capitalist bosses  
Capitalist Overlords  
i agree it sounds a lil aggressive üòÇ just trying to entertain myself at a time when i can  
Is that the same as being anxious about going to bed, so you stay up even though you should be sleeping?  
That's called insomnia, you should talk to your doctor  
I love learning something new every day. I never knew this behavior/practice had a name. Thank you!  
I‚Äôm reading this as I revenge bedtime procrastinate.  
Saaaame  
Woah really? That‚Äôs so interesting to me, I never knew there was an actual psychology term for it. Just thought I was crazy ig üò≠  
It's really interesting and is originally a Chinese term. The revenge part is about the "996 schedule" culture. Edit: The journalist defines it as ‚Äúpeople who don‚Äôt have much control over their daytime life refuse to sleep early in order to regain some sense of freedom during late-night hours‚Äù.  
That‚Äôs understandable. I guess I never thought of it as trying to regain control, but now I do realize that‚Äôs pretty much what I‚Äôm doing  
Recognizing that is a great first step!  
So...my future self is basically getting revenge on my past self?  
Yep!! After full time working at day and no time to be alone and amused, i finally have my time alone to make myself amused at night. That's what i call revenge is. Despite im tired and i know i'll be more tired if i don't have enough sleep, it's kinda makes me ready for the next day.  
TIL, I do this literally every night lol  
It has a name ?  
Sometimes yeah. Having worked/studied all day then immediately going to sleep, knowing you‚Äôll work/study all day tomorrow as well, is the worst of feelings.  
I hear ya, I had a summer of overlapping jobs to save up some cash before transferring to university.  I worked 9-5, slept for a few hours, went into 3rd shift 10-3, repeat.  I remember being so out of it that I got home into the driveway at 3AM and found a stupid mobile game (Bloons TD or Zombie Smasher not sure) and sat there and played it in my old ford ranger for a solid hour or two knowing that I needed to get some sleep for the morning shift.  I just needed something to do that I didn't have to do.  Glad that is over.  
I feel this spiritually. Ideally what felt better to me was playing a game on console with a set timer and stretching whenever I had off time to help my body adjust to the new work flow.  
My day on Monday was 10 hours of work, followed immediately by 4 hours of child care, followed immediately by 4 more hours of work. I was SO TIRED but powered through 30 minutes of free time that night because I couldn't stand the thought of waking up and attending 9 straight hours of meetings the next morning.  
I can definitely agree with this  
Yeah lol. I hate the fact that we need to sleep. You literally sleep a third of your life...  
And you work a third of your life. But if you didn't need to sleep, you can bet that you would be expected to work two-thirds of your life.  
Pretty much always.  
Why do you think I'm here?  
I can‚Äôt judge youüò≠This is your sign to get some rest  
in my 20s, I learned that a lack of sleep made me less stable emotionally and mentally even if I didn't feel sleepy. So even if I was getting some benefit from staying up I was taking it out on everyone and everything else in my life. So I started regulating my sleep. in bed asleep by 12. up at 8. If I had a late night out id still maintain the 8 am alarm so as to not get off schedule. This was the single best change I've ever made to my life. It allowed me to be much better in every aspect. Focus at work. Be better in social situations. Be a more considerate human. id say the best thing you could do is move your free time to before your non-free time. id try to get enough time before work or school that you are bored. 2 or 3 hours of being awake with a game before you have to run off and be productive make the day go much better.  
I needed this . Thank you  
Same  
Yeah it‚Äôs weird because sometimes I know I‚Äôm tired and I know sleeping will feel amazing, but then I know if I sleep I just wake up to go to work and have nothing else to look forward to  
Every single day. I do the same when i do have a lot of free time too. Vicious cycle  
yes. it is negatively affecting my marriage bc my wife goes to bed very early and feels like I am rejecting her. I tell her to stay up and do something with me, but sleep is extremely important to her.  Also, this can be a sign of depression fyi.  
Ah, I can understand how it‚Äôd be stressful for you and your wife. Maybe you two can try to find more time together during the day.  Also I never thought about it being a sign of depression, but now that you mention it that makes a lot of sense  
Yep. I used to be good but for some reason now a days when I go to bed I pick up the phone to turn on an audio books and then end up pointlessly scrolling through social media for another half an hour.  
Every. Fucking. Night. Knowing full well that I have to workout at 530am, work from 8-6 and go to MMA/BJJ class after work for an hour and half to two hours and half.  I should really get more sleep.  I keep my exercise regime up, my diet is clean, I work hard and meet all my goals at work but for fucks sake I NEVER get enough sleep. I should really start taking it more seriously.  
I can relate to this so hard. I‚Äôve been trying to get in bed an hour earlier so that I have an hour of ‚Äúfree time‚Äù but then my daytime schedule just feels so rushed. Sometimes I feel like we don‚Äôt have enough hours in the day, others I feel like we have tooo many hours  
Yeeeeees! Every night! So glad other people do this too!  
Yes! Because I know in the morning I have to go to work and I really don't want too.  
Every night.  
Yes, I most definitely get my money‚Äôs worth  
Yes! Just thinking about having to go to work, and not having more me time makes me want to stay up all night lol  
I definitely stay up late on nights when I don‚Äôt have to work the next day. I‚Äôve read some of the comments, and yeah... it seems like I do it to regain a semblance of freedom I feel is taken away from me by being a slave to my job, the convenience of technological advances and society.  
Yep! They should make the weekend longer than a work week. I'm just making up for spending my days with work.  Life is too short to spend all of your free time working to put food on the table. üòí  
Doing it right now  
Yep, definitely.  I still try to get that 7 hours of sleep in, but I would be better off sacrificing one hour of T.V. time at night to get that extra hour of sleep.  I guess I value my free time/entertainment time more than I value that extra hour of sleep.  
Yessssss I work two jobs and now my free time is very limited now. I do this all the time.  
This is my entire life.  
It took me a while to realize that was my reason for doing it, but yes absolutely pretty much every night. Not even just free time but for the alone time too because I miss living alone.  
I'm doing it right now  
Get out of my head!  I'm doing this right now.  
I do, but it's more motivated by the sheer terror at the prospect of being alone with my thoughts. Gehhh.  
Yes this too! Sometimes I lay down at night and my mind starts racing, almost like my thoughts are attacking me. Sometimes it‚Äôs easier to just lose yourself in social media/ a tv show until you‚Äôre extremely tired and have no energy to think anymore  
I felt like this until I got a second shift job. Now I stay up until I naturally feel tired and wake up without an alarm and I feel FUCKING AMAZING. It PISSES ME OFF that more jobs aren't like this.  
Love that for you üò≠  
It's called being a mom  
Have you heard of revenge bedtime procrastination?  
Yes, the first time was today. Another redditor explained it to me and honestly it makes so much sense now  
The two things I hate the most. Going to bed. Getting up from bed.  
Sums up my whole existence  
Yh, it's the only time I get some peace and quiet.  
Definitely. I lived on my own for a while now and I recently moved back into my parents house to do some house hunting. The only free time and alone time I get is at night. Needless to say I'm up very late most nights. I love my alone time.  
I feel this. I love being around family and friends but my me time is something I truly value  
All the time, its my ME time to just lay down, rest and just not use my brain, just being in silence.  
Every.  Single.  Day.  I really felt this.  
Only every single night of my life.  
As a parent of a toddler, yes.  
YES!! On my days off, I usually stay up until 4am. On purpose, even if I'm wrecked.  
Yes. The kids are finally in bed after getting up a billion times like every night. There haven‚Äôt been a lot of breaks this last year and I can‚Äôt help but soak up every minute that I can do whatever I want without having to break up a wrestling match, clean up a mess, or find someone food. I love my kids but mommy parents better after a break.  
I can‚Äôt imagine what it‚Äôs like being mother and taking on all of those responsibilities. Kudos to you !  
yupp  
You just described my life! It was causing huge problems by disrupting my productivity and I finally forced myself to sleep at a normal hour and it transformed my life.  
I‚Äôm glad you realized you needed to make a change. Maybe I should do the same lol  
I really recommend it my friend. Just try it for a week and see what changes happen. I also started meditating in the morning, nothing crazy, just 10 minutes of silence thinking about my day and being aware of my thoughts. It‚Äôs really giving me a lot of clarity in life.  
Usually every night.  
I do this every night! I am a high school teacher, wife, and mother to a 5 and a 3 year old. The only time I have to myself or to spend with my husband is after the kids go to bed. It‚Äôs so difficult for me to go to bed and get a decent amount of sleep when I finally get to relax for a bit!  
I honestly didn‚Äôt know why i do this until i read this post, thought i just had some pretty unhealthy habits O:  
I do, but only when I have paperwork past due and I‚Äôm procrastinating by posting to Reddit.  
Every single night!  
I talk to all my patients about this. Many of my adult patients are always tired because of this. Just have to make the choice that sleep and feeling good is more important.  
I think so too  
Yes and because I need alone time  
Yes, especially when I'm depressed :( As soon as I go to sleep it'll just be the blink of an eye before I'll be waking up to a new day just to do crap I can hardly bring myself to do... I'd rather stay up and put it off, even though I know it'll only make the next day harder on me.  
Hey, if you ever need anyone to talk to my chat box is always open. I understand the feeling though. Try to plant different little things in each day so that you have something to look forward to, and it doesn‚Äôt all feel the same  
Thank you so much! That's very nice of you to offer.  
Yea I do this pretty often. I used to do it even more but the sleep deprivation took a toll on me.  
I did this to a dangerous degree when I was in the military. A work day often would be 13, 14 hours long. "Muster," or required to meet at workplace at 0630, typically. our day would end at 1630 or 1700. My friends and I would change clothes at work, hop in the car and go straight to the clubs, sometimes a couple hours away. we'd party 0200, in bed at 0300 or 0330. Freedom was so precious we didn't want it to end. I have no idea how I survived the sleep deprivation. (PS, don't do the math from my paragraph. I'm largely saying we got by on 3 or 4 hours of sleep and were full speed, non-stop, endless thrill seeking when not working, putting off sleep until it wasn't possible to not sleep anymore.)  
Oh, yes. I call it my racooning time because not only do I stay up late but I eat too many salty snacks. Every morning I regret it yet I keep doing it.  
Currently  
Yes but sometimes they help me fall asleep.  
The worst is that you do it for too long, then you have to get up and go pee right when you‚Äôre about to fall asleep. Then it starts all over again  
Yes! I hate when this happens  
I experience this daily  
I used to for about 10 years, then I sterted going to bed early and getting up early instead.  Now I can play games before work and Im not sleepy while playing.  I also havent ever used an alarm since I made the change and that alone has reduced my stress level and allowed even better sleep.  
i know a lot of people like this, while i'm the opposite. i have my nightly sleep schedule so i try very hard to never sleep outside of the time range (unless i really can't help it when i'm really not feeling well for example)  
Is there anything else to do? Lol  
Thats what im doing right now.  Edit: Wow I came here to do this and ended up realizing that its a real problem with a name. üòÖ  
Right! I didn‚Äôt know there was an actual term for it, just thought it was a really bad habit lol  
That is why I have two alarms on my phone telling me it is time to go to bed.  
I‚Äôve done this almost every single night of my life since I‚Äôve understood the concept of free time, and I blame it for my inability to maintain a normal sleep schedule.  Of course, all day at work I wish I could be sleeping.  
Yeah. I work a lot of closing shifts and it's fucked my sleep schedule. They start at four, and I hate waking up and doing things before work because my anxiety is constantly telling me work is going to happen soon.  So, I stay up as long as I can, sometimes until 8 or 9 just to have some free time.  Unfortunately, this has bled into other days when I work earlier. One week I had three closing shifts, each with a 10 am shift the next day. I think I got 8 hours of sleep combined those nights  
Jeez, that sounds like a lot. One day all the hard work will pay off !  
Pretty much every night. I'm doing it right now.  
üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  
All the time. Haha  
Every night of my life.  
Yep, basically my life right now.  
I thought I was the only one!.....its really bad for me on days when I have to get up early because not only do I stress that my free time is coming to an end but I see the time and panic because I have to get up.  
Every day  
Are you me?  
Yes!  This is my big problem.  
Huh... I never realized till now but that's exactly what I keep doing I suppose  
Yes. I love sleep but I hate having to go to sleep.  
This makes perfect sense and I can relate  
OMG YES!! Lol  
Now I'm just being called out, that's not fair, I was about to put the phone down  
Listen to audio books that's how I got around it :)  
Thanks for the tip! I‚Äôll definitely try it out  
Every night!  
This is a sign of depression.  If youve been feeling this longer than 3 months, you may want to speak to a professional.  
If you're a parent, your free time is extremely precious so you usually waste it consuming pointless memes because your too exhausted to do anything else.  
Almost everybody under capitalist exploitation lol  
I do this almost any time I have an off day from work. I'll sit and play video games with a beer by me and drop the controller in my lap nodding off. My rule is when I drop my controller the third time it's time to go to sleep.  
Every night.  
Wow this is me...  
If you‚Äôre watching a series on Netflix, Hulu or whatever turn it off at a boring part not at the end of an episode. I always think I‚Äôll just finish this episode then go to sleep and of course just before the end everything blows up or something happens that you have to keep watching.  
Yes, all the time! And I hate it when I get comfortable and (almost) immediately fall asleep  
I do that literally every weekend  
Yup. I work at least 8 hours a day but most days 12 and when I get off it's already dinner time basically and I don't want to just eat sleep and work so I screw my self over all the time. Yes revenge bedtime and all that.  
It's a problem  
That's so me every night lol  
Soemtimes  
ALL the time. The urge to do this doesn't change as you get older  
Sometimes I think it's like 4:30 in the morning and I look and it's only like 1:15 and I get really happy.  
Yep, basically every day for several years now.  
I do the opposite, I like waking up early (sometimes I don't exactly have a choice, when I'm up I'm up) and then I'll just lay in bed, listening to music with my headphones and doing whatever on my phone or getting a cup of coffee and just vibe. It's just really peaceful when there's no one around to bother you, and I'll usually have about 3 hours to myself.  
I keep telling myself I'm gonna start handling it like this. It's really nice when getting ready for work isn't the first thing I'm doing when I wake up.  
Getting ready for work as soon as I wake up is something I hate honestly, I like having time to do things, especially when I get off later at night and barely have time to eat dinner before going to bed. I like opening the blinds on my window just a bit so some sunlight gets in (my room faces away from the sun, so it's not bright at all) and it really does wonders for the atmosphere. Sometimes it's just the little things  
I‚Äôve done this a couple of times before, and it‚Äôs definitely better than staying up late and chilling. For some reason it feels more productive. But normally when I wake up early I‚Äôm immediately on the go  
Same, it's like the optimal time to get shit done. I always do the most classwork in between 7 and 9 am than i do the rest of the day lmao  
Used to be bad about this except I would be drinking heavily.  Just one more to keep the night alive while watching some dumb show or youtube rabbit hole.  
I feel this  
You mean like right now? üòÖüòá  
Yes so much  
routinely  
ALWAYS. Oh my gosh, I thought it was just me!!  
Every single work day.  
Must be a parent OP  
I‚Äôm not, my daytime schedule can just get really busy pretty often. I can‚Äôt even imagine what it‚Äôs like for parents though  
Why?  I want nothing to do with kids and I do this damn near every night.  
Cause I know an awful lot of parents who don‚Äôt get any me time at all and end up doing this. Never said non-parents don‚Äôt do it, just something quite common in parents.  
Oh, yeah all the time. You see, I never really had much time to myself And I just liked the nighttime because I wasn't really obligated to talk to anyone or do anything I could just do what I wanted.  
Yes, I just can't tear myself away, even though I end up short on sleep all through the workweek. So often, what I'm doing isn't even particularly fun or satisfying.  I've likened it to an elephant pacing in a too-small cage before.  
I hate to be that person, but I'm fairly sure this is one of the most common posts on this sub  
3 times reposted lmao  
OMG I have to leave this sub. It sucks so bad. DAE drink water?  
Some people I know turn off their lights, and go straight to bed. Or they‚Äôll stay up late because they aren‚Äôt tired. I was wondering if I was alone, and clearly I‚Äôm not so my question was answered. You have a nice day though.  
Repost  
It's so much the truth. Sit longer to watch a video or read a manga. But the worst of all are the moments when I start playing games before going to bed. As soon as I launch bluestacks, I already know that I will spend at least 2 hours and probably even more.  
I say it in my car too when I hit potholes  
"FUCK! OUCH."  
And then I apologize to my car.  
Finally someone else does it!   
Sorry, Are you Canadian or british?  
Not even close haha  
I moan and groan for my car when we have to go over potholes or other small obstacles.  
[deleted]  
This is true...admittedly Ive adopted it since coming to the midwest.   
To quote Eminem, who is from michigan, "Ope there goes gravity"  
Thank you for this. I was trying to figure out that sound andd now i know.  
r/comedyheaven  
I live in central canada and we do the exact same thing here  
[deleted]  
Raised in CA and I also say, ‚ÄúOhp!‚Äù  
Native Texan and I say both Oop and Ope.  I think it just depends on the angle.  
Same. And sometimes ‚ÄúOop.‚Äù  
Omg I do this compulsively   
This is so instinctive that I had no idea I did it until reading your comment.  
Yup. I honestly hate how much I say "ope, sorry". I'll be coming out of the bathroom at work and someone will be on their way in. I'll hit em with an "ope, sorry" even tho we made no contact other than seeing each other.  
My husband does it. Even for inanimate objects.  
Ope? Like oops?   
Exactly   
It‚Äôs shorthand for woah, oops or ouch  
I‚Äôm midwestern and I didn‚Äôt even realize I did this until I read your comment.  
reaching out from philly.. we say aah fuck me  
I grew up in the Midwest and have never heard "ope." Sounds like it could be more a Minnesota thing than a general Midwest thing.  
[deleted]  
Huh. I grew up in Columbus and spent ten years near Detroit. But it's been a while.  
Lived in the chicago area before moving to southern Arizona for 13 years. 13 years there and 13 years here and I say "ope" all the fucking time. I don't even remember anyone who ever said "ope" around me as a kid.  
Lived in Columbus for some periods and heard it all the time, just like at home in the south of the state.   
[deleted]  
I live in St. Louis and I hear it all the time.  
Chicago and everyone opes  
Sconnie here, we op  
Likewise, grew up in Toledo and have lived just outside of the Cleveland metro area since then, never once heard "ope" until some Facebook shit about it started going around a year or two ago. Still never heard anyone actually use it in real life.  
You literally grew up in Toledo and never heard it?  
Not literally in Toledo proper, but Springfield Township is close enough to count as Toledo for internet purposes unless I'm in /r/toledo or something like that where people will know the local area.  
What!!!??? I grew up in Toledo and I say it all the time! I say ouch too though.   
I looked through this thread hoping to see some southerners who do this, but I didn't find a single one... But here I am, from NC, saying "ope" for way too many things in my day to day lol  
From GA and I definitely say this!  
I‚Äôm in Texas and I say it. Not sure where I got it from though. I also say ‚Äúow‚Äù when I bump something even if it doesn‚Äôt hurt.   
I'm midwestern and I say both.  
Iowegian here. Can not confirm. Anytime I see this typed out I think of that "Okie from Muskogee" song.  
Everyone does this everywhere   
Los Angeles here. I've been saying ope as long as I can remember.  
I say and I‚Äôm from Tennessee   
I didn't even know that was a thing and I live in Michigan! I thought I was the only one who said that.  
The thought at the bar. "Oh no problem" = "ope"  
no we dont  
VERY true  
I say ‚Äúouch‚Äù and ‚Äúope‚Äù but I‚Äôm originally from New England lol. Sometimes I‚Äôll let out an ‚Äúayyy!‚Äù In Spanish.   
Yep yep yep then sometimes go "ok that one actually kinda hurt"  
In Finland we sometimes say "hui!" when we are startled, my mom used it every time she bumped into something or someone. This became awkward when she had a Russian family staying over. "Hui" means something a bit different in Russian. She'd constantly run in to the family kids running around and unknowingly shout "Dick!" at them. She now uses "oops"...  
I think I‚Äôm going to start using ‚ÄúDick!‚Äù as my new exclamative   
Just tell people it's the same as oops in your native language.  
Yes and the I apologize to the thing I bumped into.  
What a lovely..shark  
Damn canadiens  
But I'm American. Haha!  
I usually get upset and beat the thing up, as if it caused my misery and my own lack of awareness hadn't.   
Legos and coffee tables must hate you with a passion, then  
Tables are my sworn enemies. But I have a friendship with Lego dating back to our childhood. It's a love/hate thing. Kinda like being married. I do everything and the Lego just sit around doing nothing.   
I tell it it‚Äôs a bad table.    
complete opposite for me. when I bump into an inanimate object, I immediately turn to face it and flip it my middle finger. as if it had the audacity to be in my way lol.  
Yeah I shake my fist at it or side-punch it or if I‚Äôm wearing shoes I‚Äôll kick it.  
I would bump into walls and say, "Excuse me," and my niece got a kick out of it. It's been a few years and I occasionally still do it.   
[deleted]  
You're welcome.  
Wait...  
Shh, let it happen  
Sure but have you ever said "thank you" to a self checkout? Oh godwhyamIlikethis  
When it says ‚Äúplease take your items/ receipt‚Äù I say ‚ÄúI know, I‚Äôm getting it!‚Äù  
Yes, me too! The machine is judging us for not moving quick enough!   
It jumped out at me I swear!  
I once had a ten second stare down with a wall. The wall won.   
It's okay Jim. I try to have a staring contest against my eyelids and whenever I blink they get in my face about how the won  
The real questions is DAE say ouch when they die fast/horrifically in a videogame?  
Mines more of a "Well fuck" or some variation.  
When I get hit and don‚Äôt quite die but my health goes way down  
yes or oof  
I oof all the time irl. I even oofed reading that.   
oof  
It's like preemptive ouch for me. I say ouch and see if it hurt. If it did not I will continue if it hurts I say it one more time while I continue.   
Just an instinct   
Or some kind of Pavlovian response  
All the time and my family thinks I‚Äôm a wimp because of it  
same here  
I started oofing whenever that became a thing, and it hasn't gone away yet.  
SAME I HATE IT BUT I CANT STOP  
Oof (help this is becoming a serioud problem)  
Congratulations, you're now part of a meme.   
Nope, I'm Canadian so I usually say sorry  
Yup!! ‚ÄúOops, sorry‚Äù or a preemptive ‚Äúouch‚Äù But now since I‚Äôve been in Thailand, my new conditioned auto-reaction is ‚Äúoi!‚Äù  
I'm so sorry!   
I say ouch too when things get bumped  
Bump  
Ouch  
Yep...and then I usually follow up with something "well that didn't really hurt".   
Ha yeah ‚Äúow, that didn‚Äôt hurt.‚Äù  
I usually let out a slight ‚Äúahh‚Äù  
All time, lol  
All. The. Time. Glad to see I'm not alone in this! ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  
Ive been getting young people to say oof instead.  
I don‚Äôt even know why I do this, that‚Äôs just the word that happens to come out of my mouth every time. Sometimes I‚Äôm even confused by it lol I think to myself ‚Äúwtf that didn‚Äôt hurt.‚Äù  
I say it when I get hurt in video games   
Me too.  
I always scream when a minor inconvenience happens  
Yes! It really irritates me. If someone else is with me, I‚Äôm like, ‚Äúthat actually didn‚Äôt hurt‚Äù because I don‚Äôt want them to think I‚Äôm a big baby.  
I use "shit" or "fuck" so long as I didn't collide with someone (which is rare).   
yes all the time  
I say it in video games when I get hurt, though I feel no actual pain  
Who doesn't do this? And who doesn't already know everyone does this? I'm so confused about what the purpose of this subreddit is.  
Basically just a place to trigger people like you. Let's go boys, our work here is done.  
Yeah, half the time when reading these DAE posts I want to respond ‚Äúyes, and sometimes I breathe also‚Äù but don‚Äôt, because I know I‚Äôll be downvoted to oblivion.   
I don‚Äôt.  I only know about it from the internet.   I had no idea.    
Yes  
I don't do it for about 1,5-2 years I think but I used to lol  
I say ouch every time I get tapped lol  
All the time! Even if it‚Äôs someone else or another object i say, ‚Äúouch‚Äù  
Oh definitely   
Yeah and I have no idea why. I just assume it's me making a noise more because i was surprised rather than actually hurt.  
Yes even when I'm alone. Like, who am I talking to?  
ALWAYS! My bf thinks I'm crazy and tells me I need bubble wrap.  More like bubble space from all things in life!   
Yep  
All the time! I say "ouch..wait that didn't hurt. Great now your talking to yourself again"  
I did this during a basketball game and someone on the opposing team said, "Ouch?!" incredulously.  
Fucking all the time  
People always are like "How did that hurt?"  
I do this and my wife is like ‚Äúaw are you okay ?!‚Äù OF COURSE IM OKAY IM NOT REALLY A HURT ASS PUSSY WOMAN !!!! It is just an expression   
Absolutely.  
I do this when I got shot in video games  
I guess ‚Äúouch‚Äù has become synonymous with ‚Äúoops‚Äù  
Sometimes. Usually, I just say "Fuck!" & my fiance will go, "Oi!"  
HAHAHAHA YUP, although I usually say oh shit!!  
I‚Äôm like this but I also say thank you when I‚Äôve given a customer something or say sorry when someone is supposed to apologise to me   
My sisters like to mock me because on time at a water parking said "Ouch I got splashed!" ...it was just a reflex to the unknown and probably 10 years ago guys.....  
i say a lot of weird shit to myself just in general  
Even worse, sometimes I‚Äôd say sorry!  
I say ‚Äúoof‚Äù in the same way that Roblox does   
I say ouch when I make any little mistake, physical or not. Like "ouch" that hurt my general efficiency.  
PG language doesn‚Äôt ever come out of my mouth. FUCK!!!! Or MOFO!!!  
I was raised by a sailor, i say Fuck. It gets some funny looks lol  
I‚Äôve said ouch to things after it happened to someone else but as if it happened to me   
Yes. And I sometimes say it on behalf of other people too.  
Yea and it ticks off my wife to no end.  
I do it almost accidentally. Yes.  
All the time! I have neuropathy and don‚Äôt feel much pain. But I still try to acknowledge that I‚Äôm gashing myself.  
Yes and sometimes I saw it when other people bump into things too.  
Takes the place of oops for many of us   
or "shit"  
I think it has something do do with how the body registers pain. Whether it is onset pain, delayed or just won't happen, it's all connected somehow. Pain is tightly linked to our touch receptors. But while touching something can spawn typical feelings, pain is a bit more erratic at times.   
Apparently this is common, but I‚Äôve never done it.   I usually get hurt, though.    
Every damn time   
I just do it because I used to not even if it did hurt and people found that very strange. Like you could get seriously hurt and If you're quiet about it no one really notices.   
No, but I do when i'm getting shot in a game  
YES!  
Yeah. Someone touched me once, I said ouch.  
I say it when I get hurt in videogames all the time and then I get mad at whoever hurt my character  
No, I usually swear.  
I do it if I drop something, I do it if I still something, I do it if the car hits a pothole, I do it pretty much any time something happens that I wasn't expecting to happen.  I have done it my whole life and I'm 61 now so it doesn't look like I'll be breaking the habit.  üòÅ  
Way too much fuuuck  
Sister does that, really annoying.  
I do that and I‚Äôll also say it when I accidentally slam a door (our shower door slides too easily) or drop something near my foot. It doesn‚Äôt have to even touch my foot...but I‚Äôll say ow.   
I say ouch even when it's a thing hitting another thing.  Much like you say ouch when another person gets hurt, I say it when my phone gets hurt.  Or my carrots.  Or my Xbox controller.  
I say it all the time and everyone gets mad at me for saying it without actually getting hurt.   
I say ouch when I drop something, just in case it hits my foot.  
Yes!!! My toddler son does it now, too. Lol  
i say ouch even when i don't hit something  
Always  
Yes  
You bet   
My initial reaction whenever someone touches me accidentally  
In video games all the time  
Sometimes I‚Äôve pre-said ouch before my hand or whatever impacted with the anticipation that it was going to hurt.   
I started saying "uO", the old Minecraft death sound, as a joke. Now I can't stop it. Everytime I hit something I always say "uO" out loud.  
Sometimes and even if I witness someone else do something that looks like it hurt. Or whoops if I see or hear someone do something awkward.  
My three year old does.  
This probably a reflex of ours.  
I just say "pain." Ouch is for when I damage something else, like if I'm carrying a box and run it into a wall.  
I say it when I get hit in minecraft  
I used to do it when we had to correct homework, because I never did it and in that way I knew which one I would have to correct and do it quickly.  
Omg, I forgot about correcting other students homework! Btw... what kind of slack, lazy shit was that on the teachers part??  PLUS, if your buddies got your paper and the answers were wrong, they just marked them as correct anyway, hahaha!   
I remember once the class was correcting each other's homework and the kid who got mine yelled out "You're wrong, Michael." after almost every question.  
It's over now, Michael. You're safe.   
Laughed out loud.  
In hindsight it was pretty funny. Although at the moment I was really annoyed.  
I had a teacher once make us say out loud what we got on our partner marked quizzes so he could write the results down. Needless to say it was traumatic  
That sounds very time consuming, why didn't the teacher just mark the pages him/herself?  
Lol this has only ever happened to me with male teachers in grade school. Probably where all of my test anxiety came from. I ended up enabling myself and dropped out of college. Whoopsie daisies ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è   
I dont consider it lazy, more like time consuming. Not very reliable, but it's only gradeschool homework, it doesn't matter much  
Partly but it‚Äôs part of the job of the teacher to look at which students are missing and figure out how they can help them improve   
Good point  
Eh I see it as a good exercise. You learn from correcting other people just as well as from being corrected. But like you said some kids just do whatever. Any teacher worth their salt would still collect the homework afterwards and mark it themselves.  
Guess what... We got to correct and grade each others tests. The teacher still "checked" if you actually corrected it good, but that didn't take a way from the fact that you could just change the persons test itself.  
What OP said and this are completely me   
And there was always that one person who would read an extra one and mess up the order so you had to rush and refigure out which one you are   
Or when a person got it wrong so teacher would call on the next person to answer that same question.  
Sooooo true, hahaha!   
That's why you do two before and after just to be safe!   
Yes, nobody was listening to anyone else at that time  
Absolutely not. We were half asleep, looking out the window at the playground.  
I was listening! And I do remember this one certain scenario because this girl misread the word tongue and it stuck with me forever. Because A) how can you be so stupid that you don't know what word that is? (We weren't very good friends at the time) and B) because it was such a bizarre way to say it that it stuck with me forever. 15 years later and I see that girl on my news feed like "wow, you couldn't pronounce tongue at one point"   
what was the pronunciation? i can‚Äôt think of a way to mispronounce it.  Town-gee Ton-gee Ton-gue (gue like hue)  
Omg it had to be Ton-gue. That‚Äôs the only one that makes some sense üòÇüòÇ  
You are correct! Lmao   
I misspeak all the time especially when reading outloud, people this it is because I don't know how to pronounce a word.  I do, I just sometimes struggle with actually saying it.  
As an ELA teacher, I always give my class a few minutes to find their place first and read it to themselves. If they need help or want to switch places with another student that is fine. Then we read aloud- with everyone feeling more confident about what they are reading. The purpose is comprehension- not embarrassment- in my classroom. So many kids have major anxiety about reading aloud/ speaking in class....I feel it's my duty as a teacher to allow my students to be confident and sure of themselves. üòä  
I dealt with by anxiety about it by doing various stupid voices. Pretty sure most teachers hated me for it, but one teacher seemed to genuinely think I had a future in voice acting.   
Awesome!!   
Yeah, they have anxiety for good reason. We definitely made fun of the poor readers when I was a kid. But I wonder if kids are more sensitive and understanding now.  
I think they are- we really focus on each student having their own goals and abilities, especially in classes now that have gifted students as well as those way below grade level. Kinda like a big family.   
Totally, I agree 100%, and I‚Äôm a teacher as well. But don‚Äôt you think being taught to think on your feet/try to be prepared at all times/take risks without needing a perfect outcome every time is also important in school? Totally, 100% agree that students should feel confident, and if they have bad anxiety, should be provided specific supports. But I think they should also learn to feel confident in recovering after mistakes, paying attention even when its not their turn, etc. Totally depends on the student and their specific needs, everyone learns differently.  
yup, every time  
100% me....anxiety sucks   
Happy cake day, my dude!   
Still do this in my Spanish class. I‚Äôm over 60.  Had to stop in primary school, though. I could read newspaper headlines at 4 years old (so my mother claimed, I don‚Äôt remember this at all) thus reading lessons were boring.  At school, We all sat on tiny wood chairs in a circle, primers On our knees. Each child would read a sentence. The teacher would correct them if there were mistakes and make them do it again. And again. And again. Literally children would cry.  I quickly grew bored and would read ahead, page into page into chapter, hoping something of interest would occur. Anything new besides ‚ÄúSee Jane run.‚Äù  So when the read-out-loud turn circled back to me I am not even on the right page any more and yelling would ensue.   
Yeah same here   
Totally did the same thing.   
I still specifically remember my first grade teacher would try and call people out for not paying attention when others were reading aloud, so she‚Äôd jump in unexpectedly with ‚ÄúSo-and-so, read on!‚Äù while the original reader was mid-sentence, and new reader would be embarrassed. I remember thinking this was so rude, so one time I got fed up and baited her by looking around like I was daydreaming, only to jump to the exact spot and pick up seamlessly when she called me out :)  
Yeah, and the "popcorn" system ruined everything.  
Yes, and I always hoped it would get to me. I was a stupid little fu‚Ç¨ker in elementary school. I absolutely could not do math then and kids picked on me every time I was called to the board. BUT I could read  beyond my years and I had a great voice for public speaking. Good diction, nice projection. So yeah, this was my one tiny little saving grace. Sad but true.   
This is the worst fucking thing that elementary teachers ever thought of. It isn't effective on any level.  
Yes, and then you get a word like mischievous and agonize over how you're going to pronounce it. Should I go with "mis-chi-vus" or "mis-chee-vee-us"??What if they think I'm dumb if I say it wrong?   
Haha this made me laugh  
Always  
I forgot I used to do this until I read this post. I always thought it was something the rest of the kids were doing as well.   
In Japanese class this was a solid strategy  
[deleted]  
Same here I thought I'd be treated more maturely in college but nope we still had to read out loud for an upper level biology class I had. I didnt even understand what it was saying sometimes because I was too worried about when I had to go lol. Same goes for those stupid ice breaker games.   
Yes every time   
Absolutely   
DAE look ahead listen for the last word of the person speaking before you so you can tune out the rest?  
I was the one that would read ahead to finish quickly and move on to reading whatever book I was reading for fun instead. And then being jolted out of the enjoyment of my book because it was my turn and I'd have to go back and find where I was supposed to read.   
I literally did this today at orientation for a new job.   
Yeah I saw the tweet too  
Yes, I used to do this all the time. Thank God I've stopped doing this, I've realized that you need to fully accept everything in the moment, feel it, own it, then it will go..  
No, we played Bump.   
Actually, in teacher training we were told to pick our students at random because indeed, they would be preoccupied with which paragraph/sentence they had to read; rather than with the content of the text.   
I never thought reading out loud was very effective. I was always a fast reader,  so I'd end way ahead of everyone else, while trying to maintain some idea of how far back everyone else was and just got confused. Eventually, I just refused to read out loud. Better test and quiz scores than anyone else in class, lowest class participation grades. Participating interfered with my education I say.   
Current best practice in teaching is not to "round robin" or "popcorn" reading anymore.  It isn't effective for anyone for a lot of the reasons mentioned in this thread, but mostly because reading only one or two paragraphs during the entire reading block isn't an adequate amount of reading.    
Who didn't   
YES OMG  
Yes, I still do it at my book club. LOL especially when we get to volunteer when do read, I don't pay attention to anything I just look for the best paragraph.   
yessir  
I haven't been in school for a really long time, but I still do this at church stuff.  Sometimes Bible words are hard, man.    
That or when being handed a practice test to basically do on the spot. I'd count and then practice that one, the one before and the one after - in case I either counted wrong or someone before me had to leave. Was annoying when the teacher decided at random who would go next though.  
Yes! Especially if we were reading a play or long poem. I hated reading in class because everyone always read slower than I did and it was super annoying. Or when someone pronounced something wrong. Or when they read in class to themselves (like quiet reading time) and they move their lips. So irritating!  
Yes! I even got in trouble for counting the number of problems we have left when doing like a math worksheet or something. The teacher called me out on it saying "Don't count how many you have left! Its a waste of time!"   
Or a sigh of relief when I realized that I won't have to read any lines today. I usually sat in the back because of my last name.  
All the time in Spanish  
I have a stutter. I needed prep time. Popcorn reading was nightmare fuel.  (Popcorn reading is when you read a section and then call out to a random person in class to read the next)  
Did it in a meeting this morning and said ‚Äúwell fuck‚Äù when I realized I had the longest section to popcorn read.  
I did this. I hate reading out loud so much because I have dyslexia - it's hard enough to absorb things from text, it's impossible to do it while speaking. I have to basically blind read from word to word because I can't anticipate the next word. I had no idea I was dyslexic at the time, so I didn't seek special consideration. I just assumed I sucked at reading lol  
Yes!!  
Oh yes. I was always painfully shy and wantes to make sure I didn‚Äôt sound stupid. I still do this every Passover when we read from the Haggadah. There are Old hard words in there!  
All of my teachers have used a method where they tape playing cards to the desks and when the teacher needs people to do things they will draw a card from their deck and that person goes, then either the teacher draws another card or they will ask for their birthday and use that as the table number of the next person to go basically supposed to be random chance, although i almost never got picked so i was a bit suspicious  
Yea and someone stands up to go to the bathroom and you gotta recount  
No, I‚Äôm not in school anymore and couldn‚Äôt care less :-)  
Yessssss. That is exactly why I‚Äôm a strong reader that can pronounce odd words quick and accurately.   
lmao r/socialanxiety  
Yes. I actually did this the other day. Was in a BS class required for work and they made us read out loud the stupid multiple choice questions and give the answer. So I counted ahead to see what mine was so I could read as fast as I could and answer the stupid question so I could home haha   
That would have been smart. I'm not smart   
No, because my teachers had no pattern to when they switched readers.   
Omg yes and I would constantly read the sentence I knew I would have to read silently over and over in my head.   What always fucked me over is when the teacher threw a curve ball and would skip a person or something.   
Yes! And counting if class would end by then so I wouldn't have to read  
no?  
Gotta love anxiety!  
Lol I saw this post stolen and turned into a Facebook meme today   
WE MADE IT BOYS  
When my voice was breaking it would ocasionally be unexpectedly high-pitched for a second.  I found it kept happening when the teacher called the register and we'd have to say 'here'.  I'd clear my throat multiple times in anticipation but to no avail and I'd sound stupid when it was my turn.  
I was the huge theatre nerd that wanted to read aloud, so I was always bummed when my paragraph was short. Lord I must have been annoying.  
Wow. I never had to do that. I think once we graded each others practice quiz but that was it.  
Yeah, all year round I don't shit myself or need a second change of underwear. But the second I go on vacation the chance I'll shit myself goes up 50000000%  
That is anxiety. Once i had an accident, and from then on I always have medication on me. Stressing about it makes it more likely to happen - stress poop.  
Yes, exactly this. One time two years ago I accidentally ate something with cheese in it without taking my medication and very nearly - but didn't actually - have an accident. I resigned myself to the fact I probably would though which is an awful place to be. Now I drive everywhere instead of public transport because if I shit myself I'm by myself in my own vehicle. And I have spare clothes in the car. But still, never actually have shit myself.   
Dude, that‚Äôs really unhealthy. That‚Äôs EXTREME anxiety. You really should think about seeing someone for help with that. Not because you should be ashamed or feel bad about it, but because your life will be so much happier once you aren‚Äôt ruled by fears anymore.  
Do you seriously just shit yourself suddenly out of the blue? Is this common? Like I haven‚Äôt shat myself once since I was 4  
I drink a lot on vacation, and I barely ever drink otherwise. The last time I drank I dropped my pants and not my underwear. Pooped myself while sitting on the toilet, wearing my underwear. Worst part was that it ran down my leg and into my pants.  
Dammit man! I‚Äôm sitting at the airport trying to stop cry laughing.   
Why are you there. Don't leave us  
This is one of my biggest fears. Pooping myself while drunk. It‚Äôs never even happened to me but it‚Äôs fuckin crippling sometimes lol. Luckily I don‚Äôt drink much anyways anymore.   
No but man you never know. Haven't shit myself since I was a lil child but I always bring extra underwear because if it ever somehow happens it would be pretty bad.  
It is probably that people are breaking/changing eating habits when they go on vacation.  A new food doesn‚Äôt sit well and now you have digestive issues.  
Plus you have things like Montezuma‚Äôs revenge in Mexico, where drinking the water or eating anything that‚Äôs been washed in the water will give you explosive diarrhea   
https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/travelers-diarrhea Shit's real, yo.  
Had an ex that claimed she hadn't sharted since she was a kid. Within a year of making that claim, she sharted herself. It happens to the best of us. You trust one you shouldn't, and you better just hope it happens at home. Sounds to me like you're overdue.    
You might also have an accident like slipping into a muddy puddle or getting food spilled on you at a restaurant. If you were at home you'd just go and change but on holiday you need to carry at least a couple of spares of everything in case this happens.  
But it‚Äôs true. Especially if you go somewhere foreign. Your stomach isn‚Äôt used to the food/water and a lot of people get diarrhea!  
Like on my honeymoon...  
Absolutely yes.  Never know when you'll shit yourself.   
But the other 360 days of the year I don't shit myself, but then the second I'm on vacation I plan for shitting myself twice a day.  
Always Be Prepared‚Ñ¢¬Æ  
There's also the chance of rain or other reasons to want a spare pair.  
Yes.  If there's a pool, water rides, or a chance of rain, my underwear count goes up like 400%.  
Also depends on where you‚Äôre going, I mean I have gone to some more exotic places with very different foods and much more basic sanitary conditions than my comfortable life in the UK and there have been times where I have come very close to shutting myself. I have so far avoided it but it has been touch and go on numerous occasions.   
Yes, and other clothing. I'll be there for three days? Better pack ten shirts jic!  
Better carry a suit and tie in case the governor of Hawaii shows up and invites me out to a fancy party while I'm there.  
And suddenly I need 4 pairs of shoes, including heels. Even though I'll be barefoot or in sandals 99% of the time. But, just in case the Governor's Ball is black tie, I'll need to match your suit so I'm going to get new heels that won't match anything else except the new cocktail dress and clutch that I also had to pack...just in case.  
And then curse yourself for lugging around a large bag.  
Packing cubes!! I can squeeze about two weeks worth of clothes into a carry-on suitcase. It‚Äôs amazing!   
That's still a large bag for a 3 day trip. I'd prefer a backpack.  
Oh yeah, way too big for a 3-day trip - backpack  all the way in that case. But for a 15-day trip, I‚Äôll take it!  Edit: I missed the 3-day part in the first post, lol. I was thinking about those times when you‚Äôd go away for a week, so obviously you needed to bring your entire closet. Then we went to Thailand for two weeks, and my boyfriend didn‚Äôt want to check our bags, so I had to figure out how to bring my entire closet AND bathroom in a carry-on.   
 Packing cubes!! I can squeeze about two weeks worth of clothes into a carry-on suitcase. It‚Äôs amazing!   Where might I find this black magic?   
I got mine from Amazon (my go-to is two rectangular Amazon brand and three medium-sized from Shacke Pak, but I‚Äôll switch it around some depending on shoes - how many/type of), but I‚Äôve seen them at Target and bet you could find them at other stores, too!  My niece is getting ready to spend a semester abroad and loves her some clothes, so I recommended them to her, too. I knew she probably wouldn‚Äôt believe/listen to me without seeing it for herself, so I just sent her these photos from an 8-day winter trip I got home from last night. I packed:    4 sweaters   5 long sleeve shirts   2 pair of jeans   4 pair of thick leggings   3 chunky beanies   2 super thick pair of socks   4 pair of regular ankle socks   3 pair of gloves   3 t-shirts and 2 pair of yoga pants for bed   3 bras and 12-13 pair of underwear   long down-feather jacket   hanging toiletry bag   small makeup bag   flat iron and a brush  I only brought one pair of boots, which I wore, but I‚Äôve rearranged how I packed each of the cubes to bring one less medium cube and fit in an extra pair of walking shoes and maybe a pair of heels or something. I‚Äôll usually always stick a pair or two of flip flops/sandals in my backpack. I can also bring about 50% more clothes if it‚Äôs for a summer trip since they‚Äôre smaller and take up less room. The bag is a 24‚Äù suitcase that easily fits in the overhead compartment. I also roll all my clothes instead of folding them flat. Edit: This is also taking into consideration that I‚Äôll wear clothes again (for example, I wear sweaters on top of long sleeve thermals, so they get more use since they don‚Äôt really touch my skin), and I do laundry at some point if I‚Äôm gone longer than 7-8 days or know I‚Äôm going to be hot and sweaty.   
Bed bath beyond, Amazon, Bentley, Hudson‚Äôs bay, MEC/Sail...  
Options baby. Options ‚Äã  
I‚Äôm afraid to comment this because it‚Äôs never happened, but probably will now.. I‚Äôve never shit my pants?? Does that happen to a lot of people?  
It's simple: you go to a place with diffrent climate, diffrent food, diffrent sources of water, diffrent bacteria and all, sometimes also less hygiene. Your body isn't used to this so you're more likely to get sick. If you get sick your control of your... needs... might get degraded or outright lost. It's just nature. Also you're not always aware of where the nearest restroom is and might be quite far from it when nature calls... or it may not have paper in it...  
I shat myself once as an adult.  I was sick and trusted a fart.  Now I have trust issues.  Plus you are much more likely to get sick while traveling.   
i hate when i‚Äôm betrayed by a fart that turns into a shart. üòí  
No, neither have we. But it's like... You never really know when you're on vacation.  
I think it's more common than you'd think when alcohol is involved.   
It's just good to have extra underwear when travelling in general. Being on a plane or a long car ride just makes everything funky. Nice to be able to change into something new when you get to wherever you're going. So yes, copious amounts of underwear when I travel.   
If you shit yourself or your period starts.   
Yeah I‚Äôm not worried about shitting myself, but I always pack extra underwear anyway, and if I‚Äôm on my period I pack extra extra.  
I pack extras even if my cycle is weeks away. You know, just in case Aunt Flo comes early for the first time this decade...  
Ah yes, I hate periods. Blood gets all over my dick!  
Wait, wha.. ?  
[deleted]  
I only have about 5 pairs of underwear so I take those.  
[deleted]  
Do the laundry every 5 days?  
No, need space for other things.  
for me it's socks, I bring enough socks to leave a trail of socks to my destination and back.  ‚Äã Also for all the people saying "you never know when you might shit yourself," what are you carrying your undies in your pocket? you shit yourself on a trip and your drawers are still back at the place you're staying no matter how many pairs you bring.   
But are you gonna scrape the shit out of them and carry them around all day then stick them in the dirty clothes bag? No, you're gonna throw them out and get a spare pair when you get back to the hotel.  
Nothing like a nice clean pair of socks after showing after walking around all day.  
Yea, because we all think we‚Äôre going to magically shit our pants for the first time since we were babies.   
Maybe it's just me, but I would just drop and squat if it's a code brown situation rather than shit my pants. It's not like people won't understand, you know?  
Code brown situation...I‚Äôm dead!   
well ya, but if you were out on the street or somewhere more public. I think I would have a hard time just squatting wherever, be the public shitter...   
You can't be too safe!  
Yes...first time. Ahem.  
Montezuma's revenge can strike even if you're visiting Toledo   
I take my oldest briefs on trips and put them in the trash each morning.  Don't want to carry dirty underwear on the return trip. Cheap enough to replace.  
But how do you fill your scrap rag drawer?   
You wasting bastard, children in africa could‚Äôve eaten those /s  
A wise man once said, "It's better to have it and not need it, than to need it and not have it." I live by this.   
Yep  
Hearing that people don‚Äôt do this gives me secondhand anxiety. Not trying to live life on the edge, not when it comes to clean undies.  I‚Äôm an adult, 28F and haven‚Äôt shit myself since diapers yet last week I had a bad reaction to food while traveling, and sharted when I sneezed. I‚Äôm eternally grateful for my neuroses when it comes to undies.   
Sharting is the absolute worst. I was on a missions trip once with a bunch of people, and we had a 2 hour car ride coming up. I sharted right at the beginning, and was too embarrassed to say anything. I sat in that car for 2 hours with a little weird feeling liquid in-between my ass cheeks. I was also wearing cargo shorts at the time, so it showed. I don't know if anyone noticed, but the second we arrived at the hotel I ran in and went to the bathroom. That was one of the worst 2 hours of my life.  
If you‚Äôre going somewhere warm/hot, you‚Äôre going to get sweaty and gross.  It‚Äôs refreshing to take a shower before dinner and put on fresh clothes.  
Uhm, I do that, but not cuz I'm afraid of shitting myself...  I mean one underwear a day is generally fine. If it's a loooong vacay, I'll prob bring just a few and washbit every once in a while. If I'm going for a short amount of time, I'll bring some extra plus one per day. That's mostly cuz I get discharge sometimes, especially around when my period is suppose to start, and sometimes, when I pee, and my undies are wet from discharge, I really don't wanna put it on again. So I'll wear more than one underwear a day.  
Yes, this is the reason and I don‚Äôt know why no one else has commented this yet. Another one for me is that if sexy times happen, there is no way am I putting wet undies back on  
Sharting is a very real threat, my friend.  
This is very important. Clean/dry socks and underwear are a blessing in emergency camping situations.   
I don't wear underwear   
2*0=.... 0  
But have you tried 3*0?  
300 IQ move   
Too funny. My partner takes the piss out of me for doing this. We now call them our ‚Äòshit ourselves‚Äô pants!   
Not twice as many, but I definitely pack at least two more pairs than the number of days I anticipate going. Technically it's 3 more pairs, since I always forget the pair I'm wearing enroute doesn't get packed. This accounts for the very low possibility I will shit myself not once, not twice, but three times during the trip. Seeing my shit-myself-rate has been 0 since I was 4 years old, I think I'm alright.  
Okay there‚Äôs a lot of shit yourself comments. I pack double because if I do something active/sweaty I have a new pair for after the midday shower.  
I pack my suitcase with enough underwear as if I'm going to shart myself every 4 hours on the hour. I don't know about you.  
I‚Äôve always done this because of the possibility of getting my period...y‚Äôall think you might shit yourselves?   
As a woman, yes.  
No I don't but I realised I should after your post.   
Yes.  And socks too.  
I just went away for the weekend, a Friday and Saturday night. I brought 7 underwear and 9 pairs of socks. I wasnt sure how many times I would piss and/or shit myself, or how many times I would step in random puddles without shoes on.  
And it ended up being zero times, like always.  
I always bring one per day, plus two for good measure.  5 day vacation? Bring 7. Etc. This goes for everything except for pants.  
Because if you shoot someone who is near you the blood and all.  
I‚Äôve sharted enough in my 25 years to know that life can come at ya fast so ya better have clean undies near by   
Than. Not then   
I bring it because I change my outfits throughout the day depending on what I‚Äôm doing. And I also like a fresh pair of undies with my new outfit   
More like all my underwear in case a mega shit storm occurs ;) just in case    
Exactly! If I'm gone for 2 days, that's 6 pairs of underwear. If I'm gone for more than 2 days, all my underwear is going in!  
I take one extra pair for short trips, maybe a couple extra for longer trips. If I need more, I'll buy them there.  
Absolutely. Better to be a gardener in a war than a warrior in a garden.  
I take about 1.5 times cloths as I would need, I have often needed to use my reserves.  
I plan out my outfits day by day, yet for some reason like 3 extra shirts and a pair of pants get included that just take up wasted space  
No man. If shit happens, I'll just go commando.  
I don‚Äôt take double the amount with me but still at least one extra. You never know! You could spill a whole bottle of wine on yourself and a new pair of underwear. Or you could shit yourself but that seems highly unlikely.  
This solved my packing problems.  Now I just travel with 3 pairs (wear 1, pack 2) and wash with Woolite in the sink.  Always dry by morning.   https://www.exofficio.com/underwear/  
About 1.25x  
Yeah, you never know what kind of shit you might get into   
Oh yeah man, I shit myself all the time on holidays   
i take less underwear and wear them all for multiple days  
One extra pair of underwear per five days out. Just in case  
Absolutely.  If I'm going for two or three days, I'll take one extra pair.  A week or longer, at least three extra pairs.  Socks too.  
Always  
"Just in case I fall into a lake" I think to myself.   
Aside from not knowing when I‚Äôll shit myself, I do it because I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll be able to do laundry.  
I always take extra socks and underwear, I‚Äôm not particular worried about a sharting situation, I just always like to have the option for a second fresh outfit for the day. Underwear/socks don‚Äôt take up much room so why not?   
Yes, because as a kid my parents always taught us to pack more clothing than we needed but even more underwear and socks. Now it‚Äôs just a habit I do without thinking about it. Never even thought about how that doesn‚Äôt make sense until now.   
No.... bit I don‚Äôt wear underwear.... ever   
Yes I do. Never trust a fart while vacationing.  
I do this because I usually end up doing some swimming on vacation, and I don't want to put back on the sweaty drawers I was wearing before, when I change back into dry clothes. Thats my justification, at least.  
Yes. I travel for my job constantly. 8 pairs of britches for a 3 day job no doubt   
Well what if I go swimming? I don't want to put on used underwear.  Or what if I decide to take multiple showers a day?   
What if I shart myself even though I haven't since I was in diapers?  
I gotta be real. I occasionally shit my pants. It's not common but it has probably happened three times in the past ten years. I'm not proud but I'm not terribly ashamed either.   
Always. And I generally run out.  
I'm a notorious overpacker.  I call my handbag my Mary Poppins bag bc if you need it I'm sure it's in there. My luggage is a nightmare on trips. Going away for the weekend? I need at least 7 pairs of undies.    
No..dont wear em..  
Not 2X, but if I'm on a X day trip, I bring X+2 underwear and socks. I figure I can't have more than 2 extra bad days haha  
Im going on vacation after accepting 10 million dollars to randomly shart  
I rarely wear panties. But two weeks worth of clothes for a 4 day trip absolutely. Never know if you aren‚Äôt going to feel an outfit. Doesn‚Äôt help I pack about two hours before leaving. üôÑ  
Yeah when I‚Äôm packing my Glock 17 I bring 2 times more underwear in my trunk in case my trip sitter bails on me (LSD makes me skiddish) and I crap my pants when a fairy smacks me on the head with his wand.   
Not twice as many, but always one or two extras.  Ever since that one time.  
No. One pair per day up to 7. If more than 7 I plan to do laundry.  
I always pack too light with the exception of 2x the undies. Glad to know I‚Äôm not alone.  
Going away for 2 nights? 8 pairs of underwear and socks should be enough, but I should probably check if theres a laundromat nearby just in case.  
Not having a spare pare of kaks in that shity situation would be a nightmare.  
Before I had kids.. No. Now that I have kids I take double everything for me and them.   
Better to have too many underwear rather than too few   
I always say you‚Äôll be so happy if you shit yourself. Always carry extra undies.   
I‚Äôve always taken extra underwear on trips and never needed the extra pairs until the other week. This trip happened to be the first time I didn‚Äôt pack any extra underwear. I was hunting early one morning in a 14 foot high blind and got a sudden huge cramp in my stomach. I had to go, and I had to go bad. I quietly exited the blind and made my way to the nearest grove of trees for some cover, popped a squat, and wrecked havoc upon the grounds of Mother Nature. No toilet paper obviously, so my next best option was to cut some rectangles out of my undies. I discarded the shredded pair then to come realize that I didn‚Äôt have any extra.... free balled the rest of the day, and discovered it‚Äôs quite comfortable.  10/10 would free ball again  
There is a very real paranoia when it comes to underwear....ie fire. They need to be clean!  Just in case.  
More like 50 extra underwear lol.. you never know bro  
This!!!  
Out of town right now...... Yes.  
Yes, because one time in middle school I got unexpectedly snowed in on a school trip and had no clean clothing left. Learned this lesson the hard way.   
Underwear and socks*. Absolutely.   
Of course. In the one instance you actually need it, you‚Äôll be glad you did. That‚Äôs why you bring it...  
I bring underwear and other clothes I've been meaning to get rid of so on the flight back, I can pack lighter. I wear those clothes once on vacation and in the event I poop myself, I can just throw them out.   
I've travelled on two separate occasions across the country forgetting underwear.  
I regret not doing so now.  Source: out of underwear.   
So easy to buy a new pair or wash them but who does that??  
I wash my clothes, even if it‚Äôs a luxury trip. I only take a backpack for meds and cosmetics and a carry on. I bring so little and still end up with clothes I don‚Äôt use.   
Yes, I also pack extra socks, too!  
I‚Äôm traveling rn, just for 2 nights. I brought 6 pairs of underwear not including the pair I have on lol  
I take 3x of everything because I pack last minute, don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll want to wear, and bring enough for every occasion...also I‚Äôm a guy so fml  
Nope I don't wear it.   
Lmao I thought you meant gangsta like packing heat so I was like wait gangsters wear two pairs of underwear   
I didn‚Äôt even think of shitting myself... I just need the security that a fresh pair of underwear will be there should I ever need it.  
My girlfriend does this. I called her insane and said its not necessary. Our last trip, the brake line snapped on our car in the pouring rain, guess who had a change of clothes saying "I told you so". After being stuck out of state until 11pm we finally got the line and ebrake fixed. I was soaking wet because we walked to get dinner. I will never go on a trip without extras again. Lesson learned  
Just in case I mysteriously crap my panties for the first time in my life since I got outta diapers.  Also extra socks, you know, in case a couple pairs walk off by themselves...  
I bring less and wash them out  
Only if it's that time of the month lol otherwise just like 2/3 spares will do  
I Always pack at least 1 extra pear, and maybe the same for t-shirts if I have room But never twice the amount, what are you expecting to happen?  
Nope. 2 times 0 is still 0.  
Yes!   
I pack 1 or 2 extra pairs. Beyond that, if I need any other pairs, I can go to the store wherever I am! I‚Äôd rather pack only the necessities and pick up whatever else I need when I am at my destination. Packing ‚Äúheavy‚Äù always seemed silly to me.  
I will often take a second shower each day while traveling. It's nice to put on clean underwear.  
I pack extra clothing, not just the undies anytime I'm on vacation. Cause when I was 19, I once had a really bad bowel accident in a restaurant toilet from eating foods I'm not used to and had shit on my clothes. You read that right. I spent the next hour washing shit out and then calling my mom to buy some new clothes in the store next door. This story comes up at every family gathering ever. I'm 24 ffs!  
Funny story: I do this for work trips. 2 extra boxer shorts. My wife goes, ‚ÄúWhy are you packing 5 pair of undies for a 3 night work trip?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúWhat if I shit myself?‚Äù Wife: ‚ÄúOh yeah, true. And what if you cum yourself?‚Äù Me (confused): ‚ÄúWhy would I cum myself?‚Äù Her: ‚ÄúWHY WOULD YOU SHIT YOURSELF!?!!!!‚Äù  
I take an extra pair, and try to fit a couple in different bags. Otherwise, no, that's excessive.  
I do this now with pants or shorts. Always getting stuff on my pants   
Not so much for me but I do for my kids. There is much more of a chance kids will have an accident. They don‚Äôt know their bodies as well plus they think stupid like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna stop the fun to go pee‚Äù.  They‚Äôre like little drunks.   
During my last holiday I asked my gf to bring some more underwear for me because I thought that mine was not enough  
I don‚Äôt wear underwear so I pack A pair just in case.   
Extra underwear and extra socks! The last trip I took I was super thankful for the extra underwear... I went and raced go carts in the rain and got soaked.   
Yes AND extra socks but mainly for the reason being that sometimes unexpected things happen and maybe the vacation gets extended. Or flight gets cancelled, weather conditions turn ugly, etc.   
Oh yes indeed  And my best SUNDAY SENSIBLE KNICKERS for church of course ü§≠üòâ  
Literally pack as if I‚Äôll shit myself everyday.  
Don‚Äôt wear underwear ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  
What if someone pantses you while you're visiting in Japan and your dick is just there with no underwear as a backup?  
I am dickless so it‚Äôs all good  
Is that a thing in Japan?  Like a stranger?!  
No I just chose a random place  
Or 0 underwear, if there has been a serious error...  
I think most programmers work in a similar way: imagine a problem, then decompose the problem into its constituent parts and attack those simpler, isolated problems. The problem with a large codebase is that no one, not even the person that wrote all of it can fit the solution in their working memory. The tendency of programmers (who generally underestimate complexity) is to say: wait a minute, this problem doesn't require 10 million LOC, I could easily solve this problem in 250 lines of elegant Haskell. There are situations where the legacy codebase is completely unsalvagable, but I think more often than not it's throwing the baby out with the bath water, except the baby is an engine that, while flawed, is generating business value.  
 The problem with a large codebase is that no one, not even the person that wrote all of it can fit the solution in their working memory.  I think this is what a lot of people - even some coders - don't understand about enterprise-grade software systems. Quite literally no one knows everything about any such system - you have to take a systems approach, design for modularity, document like a graphomaniac, and expect constant rework.  
Unfortunately, a significant number of those enterprise systems weren't designed for modularity, have little to no documentation, and receive almost no rework to minimize debt.  
This coder enterprises  
[deleted]  
The comment you replied to wasn't saying how the systems should be, it's what you have to do when you encounter such a system. No modularity? Start breaking it into submodules. No documentation? Write some (while you explore the system yourself). No time to rework? Communicate the urgency of it to the manager. That's actually what the best of the best programmers do (I'm not one but I've seen some of them in action). This is where all the hard work is, not coming up with a new solution/framework/system  every time pretending you're Linus Torwalds.  
[deleted]  
The only code I've ever worked on which was well documented was code which was documented or written after I started the job.  
 document like a graphomaniac  Serious question, how do you document these systems? What do you document? Documentation is my hardest area, I don't know what the next dev will want to know.  
Explain the purpose of each class/method. Walk them through how your code works. Explain why you choose the implementation that you did perhaps by listing pros/cons of the alternatives. Try to break large methods into smaller well named ones. Name variables clearly, avoid excessively long expressions, avoid obscure ways of doing things(like the xor swap for example). Readability is always preferable to a few saved operations, so pick readability when faced with this choice. Try to keep code modular, it's easier to understand that way. Methods/classes should "do one thing and do it well".  
I should have been more clear, what I currently do:  Make sure method names convey what they do Follow basic command-query-seperation and seperation of concerns so reading is easier Name variables semantically Add comments where something seems obfuscated in complexity Add (language specific) comments to methods that show on intellisense describing what it does and it's parameters  I'm good at documenting things piece by piece, methods, variables. I'm bad at external documentation describing how these individual pieces work together to do something. I know how they work, I can write it out, but I always end up writing a novel instead of something easy to digest.   
Hard to say precisely without knowing what you're working on, but for my work, I LIKE all of the below, though I usually have to settle for just most of it due to customer constraints or what have you.  A continually updated overall architecture diagram - literally put it in your version control if you can Ditto data flow diagram Functional block diagram (especially for OOP) Actual commit and release notes, not just "fixed a bug" Issues in the issue tracker tied to lines of code Notes describing in English what you're doing when you're working on major changes like a refactor or a new feature Either well-named folders in your code base, or an easily found document explaining what each folder contains  People tend to over-emphasize comments, IMO, not that you shouldn't use them, but they should be helpful detail backing up higher level conceptual documentation that helps the next devs find the files or code blocks they need to look at in the first place.  
Right. The sane approach to this is to identify exact parts of the problem that you don't like, and fix those, one-by-one, keeping in mind the others but writing modular code so fixing one part doesn't break the entire system or require a cascade of giant changes. You should have well-defined interfaces between parts so you can keep the same interface (or make minimal well-understood changes to it). If you don't have an interface the first step is to create one. I do this regularly on my current project, I've worked on it for 5 years now and can identify bad design choices from the past. The solution is to, when an opportunity presents itself (for example, new features or bug-fixes), take time to make changes to the architecture of that part of the code. Also when making changes you should have justification for it (future-proofing or simplifying the code is a valuable justification). That way you know it's not a vanity project because you have to actually be able to explain to people what exactly was wrong, and why.  
Yeah, this is a great attitude and is well expressed in Refactoring (Martin Fowler). I think part of what makes good programmers good is that they're not afraid to attack hard problems. A certain amount of irrational optimism or fearlessness is, at least for me, a helpful attribute. If you find yourself saying "how hard could it be" a lot, this is probably you. You just have to be self-aware enough to know that your optimism is actually a productive form of delusion sometimes.  
Larry Wall is famed for saying that three virtues of programmers are laziness, impatience, and hubris (relevant text is at the end of the article). Laziness means you only want to do things once ever; impatience means you don't want to wait for someone else to fix the problem; hubris means you think you can do it better than anyone else.  
 they're not afraid to attack hard problems.  Absolutely. I get frustrated at programmers who throw their hands up at things too fast. Recently at my (quickly-growing) company, we've been trying to divide up responsibilities for different parts of the app, but some of the leaders of other teams will say "but you guys are the most knowledgable about X". And my response is always "nobody explained X to me, I went in there and figured out how it works and that is why I'm now expert on X. Your team can do it too - I'm willing to help, but you have to put in the effort". Rant over haha  
I agree with what you're saying, but it also subtly hints at a key problem: the number of times I've had to "just get in there" is kind of ridiculous. We don't put enough emphasis on good technical documentation generally these days. Ever see the documentation for things like the Apollo flight computer system? It's masterful! Everything explained, in words and not just diagrams... lots and lots of details. Looking at the code itself is almost an afterthought because by the time you see it, you already understand it. Nowadays, we throw around terms like "self-docunenting code" and we say things like "the code is the only source of truth" and those things are certainly based on sound thinking, but we seem to think it's ALL you need. It's really not. Imagine a new programmer on the Apollo program being told "just get in there" and explore the code. Somehow, I doubt that ever happened. We need to write good, self-documenting code - and then we need to go properly document it anyway. Nobody should ever have to understand a system just by trying to decipher the code because for the reasons Joel talks about, that's hard. It IS the final source of truth, that's true, but it shouldn't the ONLY source of truth.   
The famous quote (well internet famous) "Programmers do things not because they are easy, but because we thought it'd be easy"  
So i'm an aspiring developer.. and i dont think i classify as exactly a novice either, I've been exposed to this stuff for 20 years and always had a pretty good mind for programming. But I find my biggest road block is not being scared to tackle the hard problems, but the constant voice in my head telling me there's probably a better and more obvious way to handle this problem, and I get even to embarassed to ask for help out of fear my code looks ridiculous. Any suggestions on this?  
It seems you have two choices. If you implement something that is suboptimal people will know when they see it. If you ask someone if they have a better idea then they will be proud of themselves for contributing.   
It's hard, but try to be humble and not afraid to ask for a second opinion.  Most coders love to solve problems and help peopl solve problens. If you find yourself doing it too often, draft an email detailing the problem and what you think will fix it along with other options. The act of writing it out often solves it (i.e.: rubber duck programming). Or maybe even go for a walk. I've had great solutions when not focused on the problem (too much depth, not enough breadth).  
If you review your code enough, you'll   Get used to get honest feedback Have some helping eyes to see where you went wrong Learn from your mistakes Learn how to explain your code efficiently if you think the reviewer got it wrong  You'll only hurt yourself and some poor sod in the future if you keep delivering "working" but unmaintainable hacks.   
But this now (potentially) creates two problems:  Their elegant might differ from what other developers on the team consider elegant, and Now those developers need to learn Haskell to maintain this piece of code, a likely impossible task given the tech debt and fire fighting that comes with a 10M LoC codebase.   
Amazing how relevant this is to me right now. I used to work for a dev tools company. They have a massive framework collecting code over the last 20 years. And a userbase of developers who rely on that framework. About 5 years ago it was decided to deprecate the entire framework and start over. Most of the engineers were on board with this idea, but I never was. In public, I would basically stay silent, but in private they knew damn well that I thought this was a terrible idea. It lead to turmoil between me and the rest of the team. Enough that 3 of them were able to fabricate some bullshit and get me fired. The new framework was introduced. And it was missing a TON. No RegEx, no basics like hex or base64 encoding... it was a wreck. Customers never really got on board. Yesterday the company announced they were giving up on that plan and doing exactly what I originally suggested: fix the damn problems. For example, FolderItem.Item uses a 1-based parameter instead of 0-based like everything else. This is confusing and needs to be fixed. So don't throw away the entire class! Deprecate .Item and introduce .Child with a 0-based parameter. This is simple stuff, there was no reason to throw everything away. I feel vindicated. But at the end of the day, that was my favorite job and I lost it. So this also just fuels the my rage.  
I work in avionics and our cardinal rule is: If it flew, it's probably better than whatever you're going to replace it with.  
I like that one.  
 It lead to turmoil between me and the rest of the team. Enough that 3 of them were able to fabricate some bullshit and get me fired.    Yeah, that kind of thing pisses me off to no end. Especially when -    Yesterday the company announced they were giving up on that plan and doing exactly what I originally suggested: fix the damn problems.    Yup.  
 "Legacy code" often differs from its suggested alternative by actually working and scaling.    Bjarne Stroustrup   
Isn't it more that over time the problem shifts slowly so that eventually the original breakdown is no longer relevant? For some period in between, hacks and workarounds are used to solve the new problems with the old framework, until eventually it becomes so time consuming that it makes sense to re-write the whole thing based up updated assumptions. Then the process ineveitbly starts again.  
I could solve it in one line of perl.  
I can solve it in one line of Python!  import solution   
I think most code, no matter how well designed before hand, is designed mostly on the fly. You always run into things you didn't think of and adapt. This leads to cludges and breaking the design. Once everything is done and it works, I love nothing better than tearing it all down and re-writing it with all lessons learned.   
I do exactly the contrary. When given a big spec, I usually feel overwhelmed on how to architecture the solution because there are so many things to think about, so I simplify the problem, temporarily ignoring some requirements or even features. When I say "ignoring", I mean literally. I start designing, then programming, a first iteration of the thing, totally incomplete, pretending it's the end product. Once I know this iteration is done and solid, I add more stuff from the spec. I study how the existing code must be refactored and changed to host the new requirements (which weren't actually new), which often involves a bit of code rework, and this way I build the next iteration. And so on. Depending on the context (deadlines, co-workers, priorities, etc), I can apply this process more or less properly, and I know that when I apply it properly I produce the best of code. The main difference I find between this technique and the "agile" process where new requirements appear out of nowhere (which I could theoretically integrate gracefully into the existing iteration following my technique), is that a finished spec has some sort of consistency whereas many actual new requirements makes no sense and come with a weird sort of inherent complexity as if it was fundamentally incompatible with the original requirements.  
I like this train of thought because you build up the conceptual model with variations of a working model  
I find this to be the case when I teach students. For homework problems which may be encapsulated within only 100-200 lines, I actively advocate for saving a copy of their non-working code once they figure out what they need to do, and re-writing from scratch using their old code as reference and their knowledge gained. I think computer science/programming students have too much of a habit of hanging on to their old code because of the sunk-cost, but in reality it's easy to overlook some small bug in your code if you're only reading and not re-writing.  I would say that for even large code bases, as long as the constitutient parts are abstracted out, re-writing a large section isn't bad. That's the whole point of abstraction anyway. It's just getting to that point where you can easily rewrite disjoint sections of code is hard.   
Yes it's a great way to learn, but bad for business.  
It depends, sunk cost fallacy is bad in business as well.  
That is a good method. The next step is pseudo code/PDL - read "code complete"  by Steve McConnell   - the section on PDL.  That said - the thing that changed how I code the most is doing the exercises at the back of "A Discipline for Software Engineering" by Watts S. Humphrey I would say these 2 have changed how I code more than any other book.  
 Once everything is done and it works, I love nothing better than tearing it all down and re-writing it with all lessons learned.   Once everything is done and works, I just like to leave it alone. Are u the werid one or am I the weird one?  
I think the best practice is to constantly review and refactor existing code (assuming you have the manpower to do so). That can be hard with management that doesn't understand the process or with programmers who want to always work on the latest and greatest. The long-term benefits and business value of moving from "good code" to "great code" with a little bit of love is immeasurable.  
Really depends on your test coverage. I know a lot of places where you‚Äôd have a hard time explaining to management why you ‚Äúfixed something that isn‚Äôt broken‚Äù and then broke it. Maybe financial software is just a different beast altogether and other realms are less intense   
I feel like coding can be a lot like writing in general. When academics write papers or journalists write stories a significant amount of time goes into editing the writing. Papers and stories can be edited double digit numbers of times. I don't do this when im coding most of the time. Usually I code so that it functions properly, I don't go back and edit it like I would a paper. I try to make my code understandable when im writing but once I have a function name I usually don't change it for instance. So the code will get the point across, but its a first draft essentially.  
And this is where people go wrong. If you discover, once you start implementation, that your model doesn't fit, stop! Think about how you need to change your model to accommodate this new data. Refactor/rework now, before you commit to a path that you now know doesn't work. Doubling down on a bad path is, long term, considerably worse than investing in the right plan early. At least in my experience.  
Cool man, I need you to do that by Friday tho since we have a deadline, that cool?  
Also product changes the requirements and QA found a bug with another one of your PRs.   
Oh, I love that. I've experienced it directly. Bug tickets filed because requirements changed but were not communicated. That's not a bug, that's a project manager failure.   
 If you discover, once you start implementation, that your model doesn't fit, stop  This is very wrong. Your first priority is to make something work, if you are tying yourself up on architecture before you even have a working prototype you're wasting everyone's time. You will run into yet another part of it that doens't fit the architecture you thought so hard about, and you're back to fussing over it again. When you have something working, you know about all the moving parts, you know what goes where. Now that you know this, you can refactor it to be elegant and performant with relative ease. Also a good quote:  Make it Work Make it Right Make it Fast In that order.

I absolutely, sincerely agree with everything you said about writing software. However, I think there's one thing that may be commonly misunderstood about Joel's original article:  Well, yes. They did. They did it by making the single worst strategic mistake that any software company can make: They decided to rewrite the code from scratch.  I've always believed that Joel's article was written in the context of a software company choosing to rewrite its core product from scratch, and this article was written in back in 2000 when "being a software company" pretty much meant "you ship regular versions of your code, and sell them to customers, and if you miss/botch a release maybe your company will die, especially if that product is your only product." Within that context, yeah, rewriting code from scratch is a very, very dangerous thing to do.  I don't think Joel is advising that no code ever be rewritten, or even that no large project should ever be rewritten. Or maybe I'm wrong! Maybe I'm giving him too much credit.  I still like many things about this article, even if the central premise is kind of a blanket statement that isn't always true, and is also kind of a strawman argument because most people don't mean "literally throw away all the old code and never look at it again" when they say "rewrite." I like this part:  Back to that two page function. Yes, I know, it‚Äôs just a simple function  to display a window, but it has grown little hairs and stuff on it and  nobody knows why. Well, I‚Äôll tell you why: those are bug fixes. One of  them fixes that bug that Nancy had when she tried to install the thing  on a computer that didn‚Äôt have Internet Explorer. Another one fixes  that bug that occurs in low memory conditions. Another one fixes that  bug that occurred when the file is on a floppy disk and the user yanks  out the disk in the middle. That LoadLibrary call is ugly but it makes the code work on old versions of Windows 95. Each of these bugs took weeks of real-world usage before they were found. The programmer might have spent a couple of days reproducing the bug in  the lab and fixing it. If it‚Äôs like a lot of bugs, the fix might be one line of code, or it might even be a couple of characters, but a lot of work and time went into those two characters.  In my experience, this is true. The "old code" generally has a lot of these little hacks and kludges to fix real-world problems. No matter how beautifully an application is (re-)architected, there are always going to be bizarre little things that just have to be dealt with, even if they junk the code up a bit.

No > matter how beautifully an application is (re-)architected, there are always going to be bizarre little things that just have to be dealt with, even if they junk the code up a bit.  Corner cases gonna corner. No matter what.   
And edge cases gonna edge  
IIRC Joel has subsequently stated explicitly that he disagrees with Mythical Man Month about this. Or, rather, he said, in his modest way of speaking, ‚ÄúMMM is wrong here.‚Äù Let's not give Joel altogether too much credit. He's smart, and he's influential for a reason, but many of the things he's blogged about lack nuance, are dogmatic, or go against what the evidence shows. And his business decisions are also quite hit and miss. The original FogBugz was written in his own VBA derivative, after all. And was subsequently rewritten from scratch in a sane language, ignoring his own written advice. So there‚Äôs that. In his defence, even those articles where he was (in my view) wrong usually contain an interesting perspective and some good arguments.  
Sometimes the well-articulated arguments of a highly-opinionated person are valuable because they start a useful conversation, not necessarily because they're correct.  
 I don't think Joel is advising that no code ever be rewritten, or even that no large project should ever be rewritten. Or maybe I'm wrong! Maybe I'm giving him too much credit.  My own takeaway from the article, and I first read it when I was struggling to convince my team to avoid a rewrite, is that rewrites are often a fallacy. They're very tempting, for a couple reasons. For one, it's easy to make quick progress on a clean sheet project, and harder on a more mature project, so it's tempting if you're looking to make quick progress, but, naturally, the rewrite will slow down again as it gets more mature. For another, and this is pretty much the title: more novice programmers haven't yet honed the skills to differentiate bad code from code that's hard to read. And that's not an easy skill. So they make a common mistake, which is to think that problems with the codebase stem from the code being bad, so they'll rewrite it with GoodCode(TM) and it'll be much better. Frankly, it's a pretty arrogant attitude. Sometimes bad code really is bad code, and then you should rewrite that code. Sometimes bad code is just hard to read, and you should add comments or refactor it to make it clearer. But ultimately, try to have confidence that you're using the right tool for the job. Refactoring bad code is pointless if it's somehow flawed, rewriting hard to read code will just introduce new bugs. I ultimately failed to convince my team to refactor instead of rewrite, and they spent about 2 years rewriting code that I estimated would have taken a few weeks to refactor. The leader of that team got fired.  
The siren call of whole rewrites is so alluring because we see how elegant the first 90% of the solution is, but not the second 90% that introduces all of the ugly. Then it's time to rinse and repeat.   
Those hacks and kludges need to be documented, associated with their cause, and forwarded to the manufacturer of the issue. When the issue is addressed they need to be revisited, or if not followed up on. If you aren't tracking that... if your house was held together by string and tape, and you didn't know why, what would you do? If I know the problem, I look for a better solution. If I don't, I rebuild.  
 forwarded to the manufacturer of the issue.  Good luck if it's a quirk of some major software company's product that is like that to be backward compatible or can't be changed for whatever reason.  Sometimes you simply can't fix what's broken and have to tape over it. I lost count of the number of code comments I wrote that detailed exactly why the obvious, clean solution can't be used.  
How long have you been working in the industry? I've been doing this for 20 years and people look at me like my hair's on fire when I insist that those sorts of kludges be documented. edit: The reality is:  A lot of coders straight-up don't believe in commenting code, and actively argue against it. (Let alone doing any of the other helpful things you suggested) They fervently believe comments are a code smell, because all methods should be short enough and descriptively enough named that their intention is blindingly obvious. And even when that's not the case, and a comment would be useful, they stick to their "comments are bad" mantra. A lot of conscientious coders do their best to comment bizarre hacks and kludges. However, while they tend to document the really bizarre stuff... they often don't realize how bizarre certain things look because they're too deep in the code to realize it.  Unless you have been working in this industry under a very peculiar set of circumstances, you will spend time working with other peoples' code and it will have inexplicable things in the code. edit 2: In case it's not clear, I absolutely agree with you. A lot of the uncertainty associated with a rewrite could be avoided if people simply documented all those little hacks and kludges, so that future coders could make reasoned decisions about what's necessary logic and what's merely dead code.  
 you will spend time working with other peoples' code and it will have inexplicable things in the code.  Yep. I literally removed an empty while loop and broke one of our programs. Shit gets weird sometimes. That loop should definitely have had (and now it does have) a comment saying "DO NOT REMOVE; HAS ODD PROGRAM-SAVING SIDE EFFECT."  
"Could we get rid of that thing that fixes the problem in a windows 98 browser? I don't think anyone's using that in 2018!" "NO! You might break something!" I wish I was joking...  
And then they do comment, but it's in another language so whenever you want to read a comment (or even a variable name) you have to run it through google translate...  
I think that too many people think that when they're told to comment their code they're supposed to describe what the code is doing. And so the balk because, why should they describe what the code is doing, just RTFM! What they don't understand is that the reason you comment code is to describe why it's doing what its doing. So that when you come back in 6 months and go "why the fuck would I do that" you know why. And if you have to make another change you don't revert all the little kludges and fixes  
I don't even write comments for other people. I write comments for myself when I inevitably have to go back to a script I wrote n months ago and have completely forgotten whatever esoteric kludge I had to do to get it working. Ah yes the credential passthrough doesn't work on the third Sunday of every month which means the letter 'a' gets dropped from every other sentence in the log file, that's why this fix is there. I often don't have the luxury of using anything except the framework or library handed to me by the software creator. When it comes to "smelly code" verbose commenting is just part of the deal. I get it working and move on, life's too short.  
 Yeah, that's the problem with crappy code. You think that there's nothing wrong with it because it's been tested. But how do you know? Nobody apparently understands the code. Often, code is so bad that nobody knows how buggy it is. Look at OpenSSL, for a public example.  The idea that just because code is in production means it must work is a logical fallacy. Not all code in production works. Sometimes it's just not reported as a bug. Sometimes people don't realize it's a bug. Sometimes people find workarounds to accomplish what they want without reporting it. Only when none of those things are true do bugs get reported (most of the time). There's plenty of shit that has gone wrong that people don't even realize is wrong. If you don't know it's wrong, why would you report it? I worked for a project that one step of it was to edit an existing page on a web application and apply new rules to it. One of the things I decided was better off was to rewrite the whole thing, because it was shit (it was). In the process of researching how it was working to know how to rewrite it, I learned that it never worked right in the first place. It was a request approve/deny system where there was both manual and automated denials (based on different scenarios). All manual approvals and denials were counted as approvals. All of them. Only automated denials ever got treated as denials. No one ever noticed, because one team approved/denied requests, and a completely separate team handled the results of those approvals/denials, and these teams never coordinated anything. The requesters wouldn't report anything because nothing appeared wrong as the bug always worked out in their favor. So how would anyone ever notice there was a discrepancy? This page was in production in an incorrect state for over ten years. The point of this story is to prove that this entire concept that, "It's in production and no one complains, so it must be working," is plain wrong. It's very easy for people to not realize something is wrong. No one would have ever caught this bug if I hadn't done a top down analysis to rewrite it. The important part about refactoring your own code and rewriting it is to know when it's appropriate and when it's not. If a full rewrite is going to give little benefit and take a long time, don't do it. If it's the fifth or sixth time you're doing it, don't do it. If you don't know anything new that would provide benefits at the core of the rewrite, don't do it. But you also have to know what you're doing if you're rewriting it. If you're going to rewrite it by doing something completely different, then it's probably not going to be beneficial unless what you're doing has already been done elsewhere and has been successful.  
if that was in production for ten years and nobody ever had a problem the requirement itself was not needed. during rebuilding the requirement for manual approval should have been reevaluated  
The manual approval requirement scenario required a human element and the automated did not, but were two completely different scenarios that would lead to approval with different approval time windows. It was absolutely required. It was a bug that no one caught because no one did a cross analysis between what the team that was approving requests manually did and what requests were acted on as if they were approved. Everyone assumed that it worked because it was in production. That doesn't make the requirement invalid. It just furthers the idea that "In Production does not mean 100% working".  
The real question, is that after 10 years of working wrong and you fixing it, was there any actual real benefit to the business, in terms of dollars or efficiency, or any other metric you choose. Or was the requirement met and some manager someplace could check a box.  
 The whole point is that the first time you make any system, you don't know what you're doing. Every decision has a non-zero element of speculation.  Yes, yes, I don't care about the technical details, I just need an estimate from you before the end of the day. ‚îª‚îÅ‚îªÔ∏µ„ÉΩ(`–î¬¥)ÔæâÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª I got dinged before from telling people something wouldn't work the way they wanted and not giving details until asked to explain... this happened enough that I started preemptively explaining the details behind the problem so they'd understand it....and then got dinged for getting too deep into the minutiae.  
"How deep you want to go?"   I ask this a lot.   You can either trust me (If I say it doesn't work like that, it's because I've tried it, probably hundreds of times and watched it fail) or sit through an explanation.   "Yes fluid is relatively incompressible.  Do you think this means it is perfectly rigid?  Do you want to see the equation for volume loss in relation to pressure?  The keyword is 'relatively', not 'incompressible'."    
And glass is clearly a liquid, that's why old church stained windows are thicker at the bottom.  
Nope, common misconception - old windows often (not always) have the thick part on the bottom because the person who put it there put the bigger end on the bottom, like ya' do. Technically, they're an "amorphous solid", but they don't "flow" really slowly like say, pitch (unless you melt it).  
 ‚ÄúHence plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow.‚Äù  "If you plan to throw away one, you will throw away two."  
  ‚ÄúHence plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow.‚Äù  "If you plan to throw away one, you will throw away two."  "If you don't plan on throwing at least one implementation away, then you're a bad planner." About the only exceptions I've seen is where you know the problem domain so thoroughly that you have already solved everything in it multiple ways, either because of expertise or simple problems. Anyone who claims it should be done otherwise should be immediately labeled as not knowing what they're talking about & their opinions heavily discounted.  
Managers should plan to throw away code, developers should develop like it's the code to be delivered.  
The moral here is that you often miss out on important information if you don't make an honest effort in producing a fully viable implementation.   Proof-of-concepts are great as research tools but they are typically not substitutes for "real" implementations.

I generalised my solution and nowadays I plan to throw away n+1.  
I plan to throw away n+k now.

If you plan to throw away n, you will throw away n+1. ;-)  
Rewriting is not a unicorn, and often leads to a million of other problems. There is so much knowledge and testing that has gone into making something perform properly in production. I have never experience or heard about a test suite that captures all of this. This will be thrown out the same second you rewrite everything. What the mantra means is write a prototype that models major components and their interaction. Then you learn a lot and can start over again. This prototype can be made in a fraction of the time needed to complete the project, and it‚Äôll save time at the end. If something is close to production ready it‚Äôs not a prototype, and gradual refactoring is preferable.  
 Insights from making the first system mean you can make the better decision without speculation the second time.   This is the exact reason why you should rewrite code only as a last resort, because you won't know what you need the second, third, and fourth time around either. The longer lived your 'first' codebase is the more this fact is underlined.  Worse for you, your original code will have a massive amount of secret (i.e. unspecified) functionality that was implemented as part of bug fixes, maintenance patches, module rewrites, etc. etc. etc. This functionality builds up over years or decades. A clean rewrite guarantees you will fuck things up all over again, partly because you will miss all that 'secret' functionality you didn't know was there, and partly because you will just fuck things up in new and inventive ways - because what makes you think you're any smarter than the guys in your position who wrote the initial code? And I speak with some experience. Some of my good friends are developer who were involved in a ground-up rewrite of a legacy C++ application (90s era+) in Java. And believe me, they are smart and talented developers writing really technical code. The project took 10 years (10!) and in the end, they didn't even manage to match the feature set of the original. In the meantime, the product completely stalled being in maintenance mode with no major new functionality and fell behind their competitors. The alternative, of course, was not to do a ground-up rewrite but rather update the code incrementally, module by module - with each module released and get battle-tested in production. They agreed.  This is a horror story that is repeated all the time, and developers never learn. They always think they can do it better a second time.   Yeah, that's the problem with crappy code. You think that there's nothing wrong with it because it's been tested  Because it works.  And nobody is arguing against partial rewrites of specific modules. You can do that. It's the ground-up total rewrite that is almost always a total and utter disaster.   People like clean, simple code because it's obvious that it doesn't have problems.  Great attitude to have towards utility scripts. Doesn't really apply to applications with hundreds of thousands (millions?) of lines of code, written over years (decades?), and used in production by hundreds of institutions and hundreds of thousands of users.  Trust me, your 'clean, simple code' is going to look like shit to the next guy who comes over or after a few years of bug fixes and maintenance.   
 your original code will have a massive amount of secret (i.e. unspecified) functionality that was implemented as part of bug fixes, maintenance patches, module rewrites, etc. etc. etc. This functionality builds up over years or decades. A clean rewrite guarantees you will fuck things up all over again...  I was looking for a comment like this, and a related point: that practical problems have a lot of subtle complexity, which has been encoded (hopefully) in mature code. A clean rewrite always seems nice because we tend to be ignorant of all the details until we're faced with them one by one. On the other hand... mature code which has these subtle details (unclear in code, and uncommented, or worse: untrustworthy comments) sucks to work on because it's volatile under changes. This is where the modular rewrites you're suggesting are great, so you can clarify and improve parts of the code while still interacting with the bulk of the system -- and not failing regression testing.  
 because what makes you think you're any smarter than the guys in your position who wrote the initial code?  My hubris, duh.  
 People like clean, simple code because it's obvious that it doesn't have problems.   Isn't this part of the arrogance (or perhaps, naivete) that the author is describing though?  This idea that "clean, simple code" obviously doesn't have problems because it is clean and simple. When it may very well be missing a myriad of edge cases that it didn't account for at all and the reason the past code is so messy is because it made the very same mistake and had to be added to incrementally, making it less clean and less simple over time, but also more capable of handling circumstances that no one was likely to think of at the offset. I'm sure this is not always the case, but it seems plausible that it could be the case in some situations.  
The argument is that you could turn that messy code into something clean by rewriting it, while maintaining functionality. Sometimes we think one strategy or pattern is the right one to use, and then 6 months later we find out that we absolutely wrong.  Rewriting that code with a different approach can simplify a lot of the mess.  
 Yeah, that's the problem with crappy code. You think that there's nothing wrong with it because it's been tested. But how do you know?   For 15 years in space station 13 gas defines order of operations were wrong  
For anyone as confused as I was, apparently "Space Station 13" is the name of a role-playing game.  "Gas" is the name of something in that game, and "gas defines" are define-style pre-processor macros in that game related to gas somehow.  
I should have read your comment before diving into a confusing rabbit hole of forums full of insider language.  
Rewritten with that in mind (and some context from the link): In the game Space Station 13, the order of operations used to calculate plasma's burning temperature was wrong for 15 years because of define-statements.  
To build something right, you have to build it twice.  
Thanks for this comment. This article, and a few other reasons, are why I stopped reading spolsky. He‚Äôs chock full of strong opinions, but he‚Äôs really not grown as an engineering thought leader. The points you make are totally valid. Countless times we‚Äôve had to dive into systems that have been patched and repatched by various sets of engineers, none of whom has any great sense of ownership over the system. Ie they wrote code with the goal of pushing out the product, not with the intention of building a resilient piece of software. In every such situation, shortcuts were taken and then patched over, usually with other shortcuts. Spolsky glibly ignores that this is the actual reason why engineers want a rewrite - a rewrite means they can basically start fresh and actively avoid the mistakes made over many iterations of the system. He‚Äôs never been one to rethink his perspectives, looks like after all these years of no longer being in the limelight he still sticks to what he knows.  
It depends.  I've been on many projects where the initial project requirements were "Oh, it's easy, you just need to do A->B->C->D".   Then you hit testing, or worse production, and then all kinds of wackadoo requirements materialize.  "Well yeah, Most of the time you do A->B, but in these 3 situations you go to C, then back to B, then to D for 2 of them and C for the 3rd one."  "Oh yeah, this other situation requires you to go to E, then spin a D20 and decide to go to B or C or end it in F".  <time passes with more of this going on> Oh yeah, we don't do the B->Q->M on 3rd Tuesdays anymore, now it is B->R->E on 2nd Thursdays...     Last year I finally was able to fix one of those that had been going on for 10 years because I refused to directly translate the logic between languages during an upgrade.  
This is a reality of software though; business requirements change all the time, and it WILL cause inconsistencies in the code. Its just impossible to account for anything that may change. The best you can do is design stuff to be as modular as possible (but within reason); write clean, well formatted code; and comment thoroughly.  None of that "I write self documenting code" bullshit I hear people say. No you don't. You think you do, but you don't. Write some comments.  
My general practice for commenting is to go ham when it's business logic but hold of when it's very simple utilities. Generally it's only warranted when the code is complex.  
As a programmer, I have about a 0% urge to ‚Äúthrow away‚Äù old code. However, I have a 100% urge to rewrite old code one function at a time.  
[deleted]  
I've long stopped asking. If I'm tasked to add a feature to component A, step 1 is clean up, step 2 is bug fixes, then step 3 is actually adding the feature. How can I do it any other way? How would I know the difference between a new bug and an old bug if I don't first fix all of the old bugs?  
In my case, I‚Äôm working with code that‚Äôs been around since the late 90‚Äôs. I‚Äôm just here like ‚ÄúThis project is OBVIOUSLY gonna be around longer, just let me give some of it a makeover‚Äù, but of course that‚Äôs ‚Äúnot in the budget‚Äù or ‚Äúnot within the scope of the project‚Äù.  
I try to do this as I'm working on bug fixes or features in a certain area. Refactor this class, rewrite that method. Then document, write tests, and move on. Doubles development time, but I think saves time and money in the future.  
While he makes some valid points, sometimes the codebase is just bad. A tangled mess of rushed spaghetti code full of "TODO" and "FIXME", and lots of temporary hacks. At that point starting from scratch can be the right decision, sometimes.    
People who are skeptical of this have probably never worked with a truly terrible code base. I think Joel is right about this in most cases, but there are always those cases that prove exception instead of the rule. I once dealt with a codebase put together in ad hoc fashion by researchers who had no idea how to code properly and it was the very definition of tightly couple spaghetti code. Every time we needed to add a new feature it took weeks or even months to do it because it took so long to figure out how to shoe-horn in the new functionality without breaking everything else. Finally, we got permission to prototype a version 2.0 that used good OOP, dependency injection, and unit testing and we modernized using RESTful services instead of SOAP. We had a working version in a few weeks(!) and fully replaced the old version within a few months while adding new features that had been on the wish list for years. This was no simple app, but a series of applications and web services and a large database.  Sometimes, you just have to acknowledge the fact that existing software is just bad and time spent fixing it is better spent on a replacement.  
 People who are skeptical of this have probably never worked with a truly terrible code base  I had a job where there were a dozen+ 30,000 line long classes. Not files, classes. There was a Globals file with ~2,400 variables in it. Every class basically stored its own copy of the system state. Previous developers would copy paste entire functions and change 1-2 lines instead of adding an "if" or parameter to add/change functionality. Every parameter (and global) was "Object" or "Arraylist" - nothing strongly typed, everything used late-binding. This was all in C#, so its not due to some cryptic language requirements. Needless to say it nearly impossible to fix a bug without breaking something else. Over time most of it was simply tossed and rewritten because rewriting large chunks of the program was easier than changing a few lines.  
Man that sounds awful. I wish there was a way to see a company's code before joining them lol  
The stuff of nightmares  
At my current job, there is a core class that does a huge chunk of processing. The main method is over 10,000 lines long and has dozens of GOTOs. In C# with no unit tests. Several attempts have been made to refactor this class and all have failed.   
GOTOs in C#?  Kill it with fire.  
I've worked in a codebase that had foo.h, foo.cpp, foo_2.cpp, foo_3.cpp and foo_4.cpp. I asked why there were four separate files for implementing the one class, and I was told by the author of the code (and also the owner of the company) that the IDE can't handle that much code in a single file, so he just makes a new file every time the IDE stops working.  
I'll share some quick stats on the code base I currently work on...we're currently trying to rewrite it from scratch because it really is bad.   1) Most things are classic ASP / VBScript. A few years ago I got permission to upgrade some pages to WebForms 2) They never said no to any customer request no matter how inane. If a customer wanted some text label to be red there would be a switch case based on the account code to implement this functionality. When customers left these dead code paths were never cleaned up. This has led to honest to god switch cases thousands of lines long in some places to simply display a different image with different dimensions based on whatever customer is logged in. 3) Database never had any sort of design, giant tables with columns like col1, col2, col3, all the way up to 60. Terms like "One-to-many" were completely foreign to the original team. I don't think there are ANY foreign keys. 4) Every file was in the root directory except for the few things they opted to make into "libraries", and the naming scheme was some arcane thing involving roman numerals that no one understood. If it had any purpose the meaning has been long lost. 5) Custom encryption that was basically some XOR magic. Thankfully this has been replaced. 6) No classes or complex types (lists, dictionaries). All arrays are basically magic...you end up with things like:   dim arr(10,100) arr(1,1) = customerCode arr(1,2) = orderNum arr(1,3) = vehicleNum    etc., very simple example - it gets much worse once they start doing any arithmetic with the indexes. Oh, and they also decided to have the indexes start at 1 even though VBScript actually has 0 based indexing. Due to the hardcoded nature of the arrays adding anything is a pain and heaven forbid you want to remove something in the middle. 7) Type confusion everywhere. Cstr/Clng/Cbl on everything - even if you're pretty sure it's an integer. This is because you can't actually be sure it's an integer. 8) There are background 'processors' that handle tasks that would take too long to run in a webpage - okay fine. But they're ASP pages that run in fucking IE. Yes, the background server processing stuff has a dependency on INTERNET EXPLORER. They do log to the screen but it's hardly useful because the page refreshes every 5-30 seconds.   I could go on, and on, and on but I'll just leave it...I couldn't design a worse system if I was trying to do so. It's beyond bonkers.  
I used to work with engineers who were fond of one letter or two letter variable names. And no comments. And couldn't understand why people thought their code was shit.  
The solution to the TODO problem is to replace them all with task numbers from your bug tracking software. That way you can explain what exactly needs to be done and it actually gets added to the priority list.  
And then you have managers who count productivity and success by the number of open tickets and will try to close as much as possible of these tickets to look good  
I can't fix stupid, however hard I try.  
I feel that a superior option is to just delete the comments and forget about them. If they describe really important actual todos, then they're already in the tracking software.  
The advantage of keeping them in the comments is when you go to modify or refactor that section of code, you will take the ticket into account. Perhaps that ticket is about technical debt which you can easily do along with your intended change. Additionally, if a bit of code has a bug attached or a FIXME, or XXX, when you're debugging a problem, or you just change that section of the code, and you come across the ticket link you will be informed of this critical information. Instead of figuiring out the problem all over again afresh.  
Creating tasks definitely helps you account for the problems, but it‚Äôs not a guarantee that said tasks get prioritized. Many teams tend to be more product-oriented, and focused on delivering new functionality, so small fixes don‚Äôt get prioritized.   
A priority of "just after hell thaws" is still a priority. Alternately, when you see the task number in some code you are changing anyways, you can use that as a justification to make both changes at the same time.  
I've found that even then, it's better to rewrite the codebases a bit at a time, and keep it functional the whole time. (The same principle applies all the way down: whenever I think "I'll just refactor everything in one go, it'll be quicker that way" and go into a 2-day dive I end up regretting it, it's better to make a series of 10-minute changes and rebuild and test each time, even if that means I end up doing multiple passes over the same code).  
Yes yes and you think "Oh, I could do this way better!" Then you start writing it and you make all the same mistakes they did originally and the bug reports and feature requests start rolling in. Then before you know it, your code is a tangled mess of TODOs and FIXMEs. Back in the '90's, I worked with a company that had licensed the AT&T UNIX source. A coworker was poking around in the vi source code and found a comment from 1970 complaining that the original programmer didn't like some bit of terminal handling that was going on, and he'd made a TODO to fix it one of these days.  
Ah, nothing changes. Its almost comforting.  
//TODO: write witty comment   
//FIXME  
Or you build a prototype that ends up full of TODOs and FIXMEs, and then you build a second rewrite, piece by piece, carefully documenting and testing each part as it‚Äôs added (knowing the real requirements this time, constantly checking with the prototype), and you end up with a version where there are no bugs left, the code is clean and tested. And with more features, and it‚Äôs much more stable. I‚Äôm almost done with a 2-year process of doing this right now, going from http://github.com/sandsmark/quasseldroid over https://github.com/justjanne/QuasselDroid-ng/tree/918688abd60c72efbe351e761892b65835fe4baf finally to https://github.com/justjanne/QuasselDroid-ng At least for 20kLOC to 50kLOC, rewrites are useful and helpful. Maybe beyond the 50kLOC, 100kLOC or 1MLOC limit that changes. Also, during the rewrite you absolutely need to provide at least bug fixes for the old version.  
Man, I wish I could do this at work. Instead, marketing has sold another year long project on a six month budget, and signed off another tragically bare ‚Äúscope‚Äù without any developer input. Cue many months of trying to simultaneously build a system and decipher the actual requirements. We have so many projects that are in upsetting states of disrepair and several with behaviour that is downright illegal once GDPR kicks in next month. But the boss knows the onus is on the client and not the contractor, and so nothing gets done unless someone else is footing the bill.   
Psst, TDD. Not very useful if you are maintaining a heap of someone else's crap and you don't even know what the required behaviour is supposed to be, but you have to start somewhere with your testing.  
How to tell when it's plain bad, vs something that needs time to be understood?  
"code smells" https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell Anti-patterns https://sourcemaking.com/antipatterns Also, using completely the wrong tool for the task, lack of unit tests for complex stuff etc.  
And you think the new code is better? I guarantee you that there will come a future developer who makes the same statements about the new code. I realized this also that every code just becomes bad by lying around. So I asked around my fellow developers if they ever happened to see existing code which they considered good and didn't feel the urge to change anything. None every seen such a thing. So this is no way representative for anything, so tell me about your experience. Do you know such legacy code, which you would consider nice? Edit: Oh now I opened the actual article. It's that one from APRIL 6, 2000. Yes 18 years ago the world was really a bit more messy than today.  
Very rarely. They did in fact have their reasons to make it like that, apparently the problem isn't as easy as it looks, and they had time constraints. Chances are you're being overoptimistic about your own future work as well. I mean, maybe management has since decided that a much simpler approach is OK, or maybe you really are much better at programming than the people before you. But if not, it's just going to be a costly vanity exercise.  
You had 300 todos. You replaced them all with ‚Äù// TODO Implement entire app‚Äù. Congratulations, you now have way less TODO entries.

I feel like Netscape and Borland are very different from the software most of us are working today. Netscape is a desktop application with a massive code base. I'm currently working on web services and front end apps on the order of 10k LOC. I feel like rewriting Netscape is a much bigger effort (and more likely to go wrong) than rewriting these front end apps and web services. Also, FYI this article is almost 20 years old  
 Also, FYI this article is almost 20 years old    The more things change, the more they stay the same.  
Any mature codebase will be full of non-obvious code that is there to support what I like to refer to as invisible requirements.  Invisible requirements are requirements that do not appear in any design doc or user documentation, but the existing codebase has been written to support them. They are often the result of architectural or design decisions made during the original development; modifications made to workaround bugs or performance issues; well-known application features being used by customers in unexpected ways. Invisible requirements often fly underneath the automated tests, and nobody knows that they are there except maybe the crotchety old developer sitting in the corner (if he or she even still works for the company). Any existing codebase is chock full of invisible requirements. Starting again from scratch means going through the pain of discovering them all over again (or finding completely new ones). This is not necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes a codebase is so bad that you need to start from scratch. This is usually the case when you can't even make minor code changes without tripping over some invisible requirements.  
As Perlis put it all the way back in 1982:  7. It is easier to write an incorrect program than understand a correct one.   
While he may have a point, he picked the absolute worst possible example in history to illustrate it. Netscape 4 was garbage. You couldn't even resize the window without a complete reload. Hundreds of glitches in rendering. Getting absolutely destroyed by IE in every way. They made the best decision of their lives ditching that buggy codebase and beginning what would become Firefox, a revolutionary browser at the time. I'm almost certain trying to build Firefox off Navigator 4 would've been an absolute failure and disaster.  
[deleted]  
Holy shit, I remember this article.  I thought it was stupid then, and two additional decades of programming experience has confirmed it. Sometimes rewriting code is a bad idea.  Sometimes a codebase is well and truly fucked, and it's holding you back.  Most code is somewhere in the middle and needs to have time spent on it repaying technical debt.  If you've got hacks upon hacks upon hacks, you're usually better off starting over.  
 Netscape 4 was garbage. You couldn't even resize the window without a complete reload.  Netscape 6 had the same problem.  
As a freelancer who has taken on a lot of "fixer-upper" projects, I disagree a thousand percent. Most legacy code is garbage, and should be treated as such.  
This article has an interesting way of ageing. When I read it the when it was first written I absolutely agreed with Joel, the rewritten version of netscape was absolutely atrocious. However ten years later the decision to rewrite was completely vindicated with the success of firefox. Joels was then dead wrong. Mozilla would not have succeeded in making an IE killer tied to the very brittle code base of the original netscape browser. Today the field is even more interesting, mozilla has a very interesting rewrite project with Servo. Now I think Joels main point stands, a lot of the instinct programmers have for wanting a rewrite is because it is much harder to read code than to write. As anecdata I do see a correlation with skill and how much maintaining a programmer has done  
Servo/Quantum is actually a decent example of following Joel's advice. Mozilla didn't throw out the whole application at once, instead they are rewriting and replacing subsystems.  
As someone who threw out an entire codebase and spent the last two years rewriting it: no, I was not wrong. There's good (bad?) reasons it was difficult to read before: it was a mess. The new codebase is so well organized I can put it down for long stretches and get reacquainted with it easily. The key here is whether you're scrapping an idea or just your execution of it. In my experience, my original ideas are often sound, and when I later ask why I thought of something so ridiculous, it usually turns out there's very good reasons for it. But execution can always be improved, and sometimes that requires low-level rewrites. Everything else is just iteration.  
No. Very often the old code IS shit. Reading may be harder than writing but that does not change whether the code in itself is bad. I hate rewriting but very objectively the net result of the rewrite is often MUCH, much better than the prior version. This often happens because lateron it is more clear what the code should be doing; and whether it is doing it in a good way. Sometimes a language design can also become better, and old expressions can be re-written in better ways too.  
Very often the new code is also shit. Most large projects I've seen where the dev team decides to completely rewrite from scratch, they end up making a new giant codebase which is shit for completely different reasons, and it ends up taking way longer than anyone thought. Part of this also seems to stem from the fact that the rewrite team is rarely the exact same team that started the original project because too many years have gone by, so the rewrite is effectively the first time the current team has actually built the product. My own anecdotal evidence suggests rewriting pieces over time is almost always more successful than a full rewrite in one shot. Unless of course the codebase is fairly small.  
 they end up making a new giant codebase which is shit for completely different reasons  Speaking as a end user for a moment...  How many times have we all seen a piece of software get replaced by a new, better piece of software. Often a completely new product by a different company. But it's not any better, it's just crappy in different ways. Every once in a while, it truly is better, but not very often.  
 Very often the new code is also shit.  Bingo. Typical dev arrogance is usually on the display when they think they can do a better job than their peers just a few years ago.   My own anecdotal evidence suggests rewriting pieces over time is almost always more successful than a full rewrite in one shot.  Mine too. I maintain an app I build with a team ten years ago. There are plenty of things I would do differently I started all over again, but we have hundreds of customers and thousands of users - it works. If code area inevitably starts getting flakey (and it will happen), we re-design it and rewrite it.

It's very hard to overstate just how much shit code is out there, especially when you're talking about non-tech companies that don't put a high priority on software (aka most of the world).  I'm not just talking about "I don't like this code," "this code isn't clean," or anything of the sort; I mean true steaming piles of shit.  Here's a great example.  At my last job our team inherited a 25+ year old application that was bad overall (to the point where we had to rewrite it), but one enhancement added in the late 2000s really stood out. This feature involved connecting to a serial device using the .NET SerialPort class and reading measurements sent ~20 times per second.  The data format was basically STX1  NN  00\n where STX is the actual "start of text" character (0x02), NN is 1-6 decimal digits, and the spacing is variable but the length of each line is fixed (16 characters IIRC).  In order to parse this, the original developers had come up with a 200+ LOC monstrosity that had three nested infinite loops interacting with 3-4 global variables, including a timer (???)... in addition to about 4 old commented out versions of the parsing code with the same basic layout.  I never did manage to figure out how the hell that old code worked, but my replacement amounted to about 20 LOC total.  
Reminds me of the worst piece of code I have ever seen on finding a maximum. Back in college I took a difficult operating systems course in which you are partnered with somebody for the year. My partner happened to be pretty bad at coding. One of the assignments, each of which takes about 100 hours over 2 weeks, was basically creating threading/processes, with a separate far easier segment for creating a scheduler. I told my partner I basically will do all of it, but I will pass to some function "grab next prioritized thread" for the scheduler and he just has to write the function on deciding which thread is next. He spent maybe 5 hours tops while I did the other 95% of the project, and I didn't bother reading what he had written for the code since it was working. We got the project back docked for design decisions. I was baffled and spoke with my TA about it and asked why, and he pointed to the scheduler... Each thread was given a priority, and the highest priority thread was the one to be used next in the scheduler, so he had to write a function for "find the thread with highest priority". The function he wrote... for finding a maximum... for (i = UINT_MAX; i > 0; i--) {     thread = find_thread_with_priority(i);     if (thread != false)         return thread; }  Or basically, start at maximum possible number -- does a thread exist with this priority? No? Okay, repeat with maximum minus one. No thread? repeat... Until you find a thread... I couldn't believe what I was reading  
I don't know what you're complaining about, that algorithm always finds the highest priority thread. /s (should probably be /cry)  
Depends. Is old code shit because it‚Äôs bad?  Or is old code shit because somebody else wrote it? Many times this is used to replace code somebody else wrote and the new programmer doesn‚Äôt understand the new code and why it was designed that way. Then during the rewrite, you discover all the reasons why it was written this way. Reading code is its own skill and it‚Äôs under appreciated. It includes deciphering the original requires as implemented.   
for you, but what about for the customers? Is a rewrite a success if you miss 50% of the features? And I don't mean rewriting some small 20,000 line app....I mean rewriting a 1,000,000+ line enterprise app. There is always a trade off.  
 Is a rewrite a success if you miss 50% of the features?  Depends on whether or not those features were actually being used. The hard work starts long before a single line of code is changed.  
[deleted]  
That's why companies like mine exist. We'll interview your users, read all the regulations, document every screen, examine all of the code, etc. It's mind-boggling expensive, but sometimes it is necessary.   
 And I don't mean rewriting some small 20,000 line app.  I think people clamoring for rewrites in this thread have tiny JS apps in mind. Yeah, I agree, in those cases - go nuts. Rewrite your Angular app in React because it's cool.  Rewriting a legacy enterprise application with hundreds of thousands or millions of lines of code will take years! In the meantime, there's a business that needs to run.   
I mean, where I work the control software we use has been in continous development since the early 90s. Which makes changes which would take 5 minutes on new code take 4 hours instead.  There comes a point when the old code should be thrown out.   
If its shit code of course it will be harder to read than write.  The idea of the rewrite is to make it easier to comprehend.   
Back in 2013 I pushed my team to rewrite our codebase in RoR. Originally it was a 600k+ line PHP and JS app.  You are giving a gift of two or three years to your competitors, and believe me, that is a long time in software years.  It took us roughly 3 months to get stable.  It‚Äôs important to remember that when you start from scratch there is absolutely no reason to believe that you are going to do a better job than you did the first time.  We learned from our mistakes. I 100% stand by my decision. The increase in productivity was invaluable. The code base is now less than 30k lines. Don't haphazardly rewrite your entire codebase, but don't take this article too seriously either. Edit: I realized I wasn't counting the templates in the RoR app while the templates in the PHP app were all included in my initial count. And in an effort to be fair, a more accurate total for the RoR app actually stands at 41k lines. While going back to investigate I also found that the PHP app had a 25 line license in almost every file, amounting to roughly 86k lines of license.  
Its all subjective. There ARE codebases that have so much technical debt that you can't possibly fix it all without it being a re-write anyways. Then there are cases where a re-write is temping because things are not perfect, but in reality the code base is good enough to get the task done.  For the cases where a codebase really has to be re-written, I find it is almost always because one or both of these reasons:  Someone who wasn't experienced enough was in charge in the beginning, worked in isolation, and they set a foundation that was doomed to fail.  The project lacked any peer review and/or planning that would have prevented a problem from getting out of hand.  The second item is really important. Project leads a lot of times think they have to review code, but their own code does not need review. this is false. Noone is immune to making mistakes, and I firmly believe that every piece of code in a system should be reviewed by at least another person regardless of the seniority of the person writing it.  
 It‚Äôs harder to read code than to write it.  Except that's it's not AND it's not the reason most people want to throw out old code. There are changes in technology, there's bad design and bad code out there  and constantly applying bandaids instead of biting the bullet and starting fresh is a bad way of looking at things. I'm not saying throw out the code every time but there needs to be a line drawn at some point. Case in point some of our in house software is in VB6; It uses controls that have no 64 bit version ocx because whoever made the controls stopped existing before 64 bit os and I'm not even sure we could get them working registered on windows 7 32 bit for that matter. This means we have to have a windows XP VM in our pool in order to make bug fixes or update features and hope to god nothing happens to corrupt that box and its backups.  It also means I can't install VB6 into a more recent version of windows to run debug in an environment that matches what one of my users has. Instead when I want to debug something I'm not experiencing on DEV I have to add a ton of Msgboxes that yell various profanities where I THINK the crash might be and see which profanity doesn't pop up. Had an instance where the user changed his region settings to french, and it Borked a CDATE() somewhere because it didn't know how to deal with the french version of the Month. The programs talk to a set of access databases and has some of the most convoluted code I've ever seen. I hate that code with a passion, doesn't mean I can't read it, it's just retarded.   For instance whoever coded this originally made a Replace function that overwrites the built in Replace function with a significantly worse one that is prone to infinite loops, because why the fuck not? Or how about the fact that every table is loaded into a "temporary" table before being read. seriously... Everywhere in the code there is a call to a function that drops tblTemp followed by a select * into tblTemp from whatever table they need at the time no joins or anything fancy like that and THEN the code does a select * from tbltemp where blahblahblabedyblah. This software runs at over 60 locations across the country, I have to interrupt these people's workdays for 20-30 minutes to run fucking compact and repairs in access at 99.9% of these locations on a weekly basis because they run the risk of hitting the 2 gig database limit. Not to mention every SQL command you have to write has to take into consideration the fact access is a "special needs" child and doesn't like to follow normal conventions. It's the Internet Explorer of databases. There is stuff in there that has 100's of lines of buggy code doing things which I could do in 20. Have I mentioned it's VB6 code yet? Yes I have. Know what that means?  No Try/Catch. Error handling/logging is shoddy at best and non existent in most cases. Here's the thing, I can read old code fine... the problem is that it reads like the fucking Twilight Series...  
I think it would be very interesting to see how developers' attitudes about this "rewrite vs. fix it" issue corresponded with years of experience. I'd guess that new developers would lean toward "fix it," developers with a few years of experience would turn toward "rewrite." And the grizzled vets would be back at "fix it." Piecemeal refactoring isn't something most developers enjoy, but in contrast to a total rewrite, it can produce positive, tangible results very quickly. It can be fun. It is also, from a business standpoint, safe and cheap. Fast, safe, cheap: choose any three. How often do you get an opportunity like that in engineering? Something Spolsky doesn't mention here, but something I've noticed in my own projects: What you recognize as "cruft" in old code that someone else wrote often turns out to be, on much closer examination, "features." It's not until you examine it in the kind of detail required for a rewrite that you realize all the subtleties of the way Feature A and Feature B interact with each other. Your rewrite might be slightly cleaner than the original, but it's not going to be the sleek glistening monument to your own genius and discipline you imagined when you started, because the interaction between A and B just turns out to be complicated. Not complicated as a programming exercise, but actually complicated in the real world.

The reason I want to throw away old code is because when you first write a program, you aren't really sure what the best way to do things are. You might not even be quite sure what you want to do. Once you write the program, you have a much better idea of these things, and could rewrite the program in a much cleaner way.  Of course, your manager doesn't want to allocate time for that, because the first version works, doesn't it? So then a year goes by, and someone looks at your code, and wonders to themselves: 'what the fuck is this?'  
Yeah I feel like the general consensus here is that the title/article is ridiculous. You know a good code base when you read through it and similarly, you know a shit code base. The amount of technical debt that gets built up over months/years of maintaining bad code is incredible. And the amount of time wasted is too. I don‚Äôt know why programming is viewed as different from other fields; you wouldn‚Äôt write a report and submit your first draft. You write some ideas that get your point across, but it‚Äôs shit and not structured well, so you keep small parts and rewrite most of it. The only difference is that writing a code base takes longer and passes through different hands. But the goal should always be to write the best piece possible and improve where things can be improved, not persist trash  
As someone who is not a programmer, I can‚Äôt imagine how frustrating (and rewarding) some of that coding may be. Props to all of you, and I appreciate what you all do for the world.   
I don't think it is harder to read than write.  I think people overestimate how difficult it is to read and underestimate how difficult it is to write. Not only that, but tools for refactoring are poor in general and very poor in many languages.   I want to at least be able to move variables around and have that changes trickle down to where they are used.  
Reading code is relatively easy, understanding it isn't. As someone who's daily Job it is to plug holes in a 30yo codebase, most of my time is spend reverse engineering the code and figuring out what the purpose of the various parts is. And only something like 10% of the time am I writing actual code. Sure I can spot quite quickly what someone is doing in their code, but not why. And understanding that bigger picture in an existing project is harder then writing it. And crucial in order to improve on it.  
Reading good code is easy. Writing good code is hard. Reading bad code is hard. Writing bad code is easy.  
Is this an issue with Polymer in general, or just how it was used on YouTube?  
It looks like polymer has migrated to v1, based on here  V0 is scheduled for deprecation starting in April 2018 and removal in April 2019. If you are still using this consider migrating to the new API or upgrading your Polymer library.   
So YouTube is using an older version of Polymer? Huh.  
[deleted]  
Except google can't seem to make up its mind which library to use, they more or less deprecated polymer 3 as soon as it was released: their roadmap faq recommends people to use the even newer lit-element rather than polymer for new projects reminds me of that "how it feels to learn javascript in 2016" article all over again  
Polymer back then was basically built on the bet that web components and shadow DOM were picked up as standards and implemented by all browsers eventually. That bet didn't pan out and we're left with Chrome which is effectively the blueprint for the spec, Safari where shadow DOM is broken in so many places and no one fixes it, and everyone else who waited for the dust to settle. By now no one else really wants to implement it, which left Polymer at a stage where all browsers except one would always need a polyfill (which made every DOM operation horribly slow). We've used Polymer at work for an application (currently being rewritten with a hopefully longer-lived framework) and ended up having to tell Firefox users that performance may be unacceptable.  
 currently being rewritten with a hopefully longer-lived framework  Which framework is that?  
Polymer in general, at least in earlier versions, it's based on the v0 API mentioned here. I think newer versions behave better in other browsers since the API did get a v1 that other browsers are implementing, but it's still not great.  
Polymer 2.0 and greater uses the v1 APIs, which is released in Safari and Chrome, and will likely be in the next release of Firefox, v63. You can try it out in Firefox today with the dom.webcomponents.enabled and dom.webcomponents.shadowdom.enabled preferences. More info: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM  
Note that enabling dom.webcomponents.shadowdom.enabled in Firefox won't speed up YouTube at this time because the site is still using Polymer 1.0 that only knows Shadow DOM v0.  
YouTube in general needs a viable competitor. Not just someone else that does video, but an actual competitor that can bring in the content creators. I fear the only ones capable though are other already big players (Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook (is trying but it's kinda meh)) rather than new smaller ones. Basically because it's hard to make money on effectively either a "free" service and the selling the users to advertisers model.  
At this stage, the infrastructure requirements are so high I can't see anyone but Amazon actually competing. And while they've got Twitch, I'm doubtful they'll ever expand it to be a YouTube competitor since it'd ruin the current brand image that's made it successful in the first place.  
Amazon can launch a new site to compete with YouTube.  
They could try, but Amazon has tried to launch a number of competitive brands in the tech space that just haven't caught on. Personally, I don't think it'd work unless they bought an existing brand or used one they already own.  
[deleted]  
I mean there was supposedly talk of pornhub branching out.  I never took it seriously, but if you're talking about a place that cares about content creators and has the infrastructure...  
Hmm... ya know, it would be very interesting to see this sector finally be the ones to seize the opportunity. And why on earth shouldn‚Äôt they, ya know? The entire industry revolves around meeting the demands of their consumers in a nimble, responsive way while making a lot of money doing it. It really seems like a match made in heaven.  
Google is going through their own 'embrace, extend, extinguish' phase. Embrace open source, extend existing projects like Webkit with lots of improvements, but ensure their stuff is shit on anything non-Google. It's kinda sad how they've changed. I'm glad we can now rely on the true bastions of open source; Microsoft.

The Rosyln compiler, Xamarin, their improvements to git, Typescript, Chakra etc. A few more of the big examples of open source Microsoft code in recent years.  
Until you see what? They've open source a fuck ton of stuff in the last couple years, not to mention their contributions, financial and dev, to git itself.  
And .net core  
And Entity Framework. And typescript. And powershell. And the list goes on.  
I don't see why you think they've "changed". They have always been like this. This is simple case of competition - when you are catching up you play good, when you are on top you try to monopolize and optimize for profits (in this case control of the ecosystem). Microsoft are only good now because they are catching up. Google are still worse than MS though because Google are extreme hypocrites and people fell for it. MS didn't act like they were some charitable organization and they even proudly proclaimed that they want an MS PC on every desk.  
Some people genuinely care about open source. Red Hat never tried locking down Linux. Mozilla never leveraged Firefox into altering the internet by fiat - they couldn't even get APNG off the ground.  Not every company has a Larry Ellison.   
I still want my APNGs damn it.   
Google wants you to use animated WebP though so no APNG for you. Although to be honest I don't necessarily think the internet is responsible enough for a lossless animated format because you know idiots are going to use it for content that should not be lossless and fuck your mobile connection with a 100MB animation that should be in a video format.  
Google Reader comes to mind. In an egregious example of Embrace, Extend, Extinguish, Google single-handedly killed RSS readers for all but the most hardcore of enthusiasts.   
YOU WILL PRY MY RSS FROM MY COLD, DEAD HANDS. Seriously, RSS is the most important web technology nobody is thinking about anymore, and it's anger inducing.  
Because it's hard to deliver ads over rss. I'm assuming.   
I was as angry as anybody when Google killed Reader, but I don't think that's why RSS is dying.  RSS is dying because of Twitter and Facebook. I hate it when I hear people talk about how Twitter is great for news, not realizing that they could use an RSS reader like Feedly to get all of the same information in a much saner format.  (No one says that Facebook is great for news, but apparently they use it anyway.) Honestly, I'm pleasantly surprised that RSS has lasted as long as it has.  I suspect the only reason it's still viable is because it's popular among the sort of people that build websites.  
I think it might be on cusp of having a renaissance. Lots of prominent people such as Tim Berners Lee have come to its defense recently.  
Using FB as your news source is a whole other issue...it's like Fox News, HuffPost, MSNBC and Drudge all having an orgy without protection  
RSS and Google Reader lead me to XKCD which then lead me to Reddit 10 years ago.  
Microsoft is hardly playing catch up. Their stock prices are up something like 120% in 2 years.  
Microsoft's doing fine financially and possibly ahead in regards to cloud infrastructure. But they're playing catch up on web & open source and have pretty much given up on mobile.

 I'm glad we can now rely on the true bastions of open source; Microsoft.  God dam we went full circle  
With Bing I at least get a proper image search.  
Bing image and video are fun places to visit.  
They're excellent.  Search a portion of an image is great.  
Since Satya took over this has been surprisingly true. The biggest thing I‚Äôve seen is the recognition that Windows won‚Äôt last forever so they are diversifying across the platforms. So far they‚Äôve been true to their word. I‚Äôm a Windows dev but also work on the Roku platform and use VS Code from Linux.  It‚Äôs an amazingly consistent experience. And they just released a news Python Language Server for VS Code that I‚Äôm playing with, but so far it looks pretty good. Full Disclosure: I actually live in Redmond so know plenty of a Microsoft employees but I work in Seattle. I did do some contract work for MS a few years ago, but that‚Äôs my only ‚Äúinside ‚Äú experience with the company.  
 I'm glad we can now rely on the true bastions of open source; Microsoft.  Let's not be hasty now.  
I know it's a joke, but compared to google modern Microsoft is absolutely more open

Probably even five years ago.   
 embrace  Interesting word choice.  
In this case I don't think it's that malicious. Just look at the trash fire that is YouTube gaming. YouTube just had no idea what they are doing.  
Youtube has also worked for years to prevent people from watching in the background, instead of, uknow, disabling the video stream and letting the audio play. The removed any app on the play store that allowed background play, forced firefox to pause it, and to remove any setting allowing the opposite. Despite not making any money, it took them 20 years to offer a paid ad-skip solution, and it doesn't even allow for direct channel support. They had to wait for fucking patreon to see that there were people both willing to pay to not have their time sold to the highest bidder. They fucked themselves over trying to appease adverisers that have no idea what they want, while actually encouraging the worst kind of content targeting children. Just a fucking garbage fire.  
PornHub needs to launch a non-porn spinoff already so we can all stop using Youtube  
They even have the technical expertise to build a streaming platform. It wouldn't be the crazyest thing they've done.  
20 years? YouTube was started in 2005.  
IE6 wasn't malicious, and look at what it did to the web. Google have been pulling this shit for a while and I don't buy the "it's just incompetence" line any more. They have gone out of their way to break their own applications for Edge (G Maps) in the past. YouTube's failure to get its shit together smells more like malicious negligence with the added bonus of plausible deniability.  
They named their premium offering YouTube Red. The people that make decisions are just stupid.  
You mean RedTube?  
If you have a monopoly it DOES NOT MATTER the intention - the end result matters. And hear Google prioritizes on their own product (their browser), at the expense of competition. The US has joke laws so they won't do something but the EU has already fined Google and will continue to do it until Google complies - or is forbidden from partaking in the EU market.

Glad to see people using my project! I'd love to hear your feedback on how to make it better. I'm pretty happy with how light the site is (the homepage is ~6.5kb compressed without images), For other folks who just want to use YouTube, you can add &disable_polymer=1 to the video URL to hopefully speed up rendering. EDIT: Thank you everyone so much for your feedback! Invidious is open-source, so feel free to open an issue here. Thank you again!  
invidio is yours? The only thing I'd add is a dark theme and maybe a "sort by" for channels, other than that it seems to be pretty good.  
You can actually already enable dark mode in your preferences. I've heard that requested more though lately so I should probably move it someplace more obvious so people can find it :P  
Found it, I was using it without an account. Also, is the option to import subscriptions from youtube available? NewPipe has it, so I know it's possible  
I've used your site for all of like 10 minutes and my only complaint is that I can't scroll on the volume slider. As someone with multiple monitors it'd be nice to just scroll on the volume bar/the video to change the volume  
I always thought the issue with these alternative frontends for youtube is that half the videos you actually want to watch have playback disabled for them on specific sites.   
Yep. Most big youtubers disable embedding, because it leads to low quality views (close to no revenue, short watch time, no engagements)   
How come Google shut HookTube down?  
Essentially, the developer was making a competing product using the YouTube API, which is against their Terms of Service.  
?disable_polymer=true works for getting rid of the new design on Safari, maybe other browsers too Edit: this doesn't seem to stick across tabs, but there's a cookie you can set instead which is what the addon does: https://github.com/thisdotvoid/youtube-classic-extension/blob/master/background.js#L65 I forgot this. There used to be an opt-out button that I suspiciously can't find anymore :)  
Wow, it works great on Firefox. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to stick when you navigate to other pages...  
[deleted]  
An easy alternative to the Tampermonkey script is to install the "YouTube Classic" Firefox extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/youtube-classic/  
Wow, I didn't realize how slow Youtube has become.  
Wow this works so fucking well. YouTube has been so agonizingly slow since the redesign.  
 ?disable_polymer=true  Hallelujah! I was looking for some way to get the old youtube back  
Google is evolving in pretty much the same way Microsoft did back in the good old days of the 90s. The basic pitfall of overwhelming success is eventually complacency and stagnation.  
[deleted]  
I don't think anyone is debating that, but that doesn't mean people should give them a free pass when they do something shitty.  
Short term money making is often filled with cheapskate bullshit schemes that end up backfiring too.  
Polymer has just been a disaster since day 1 anyways. Not surprised they didn't bother to test with other browsers, half the time it doesn't even work in Chrome. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u6Bfnq3aZk  
It's not like you're required to use Chrome to work at Google. There are dozens of people who use Firefox there! I had to file an issue against the internal code search tool some years ago because its browser search integration thing worked in Chrome but not Firefox. I wonder how many years it had been broken...  
I was under the impression that there was a fairly large contingent of Safari users internally. It was totally not my friend who works there and sends me Go Lang memes all day long when he should be working ...  
Why would anyone use Safari in this day and age?  
[deleted]  
I've heard that it's significantly more power efficient than Chrome in macOS.  
They bought a MacBook  
The playlist system is still broken in a fair few ways since the redesign as well. You'd think something fundamental like that would get some proper testing or at least get looked at at least once after they pushed the redesign out to the public, but nope.  
That video absolutely does not use the Polymer rebuild of youtube. Polymer didn't even exist in 2013. And the Youtube rebuild of Polymer wasn't fully released to the public until a few months ago IIRC. It's been in A/B testing for several months at most. It was used on Youtube Gaming a bit longer than that but not by much.  
I still want to kill whoever made the Material Design theme that reddit and youtube's redesigns use. Looks fucking ugly on desktop. No surprise that it performs like shit too.  
I honestly cannot believe how slow the Reddit mobile redesign is. How did they take a functional website and redesign it to now take 10-15 seconds to display text and images in a list? Is all the extra white space that computationally demanding?    
Remember how a news site made a GDPR compliant version by just removing all the tracking, which resulted in a 500kb page that worked like a champ?  
It's https://eu.usatoday.com, and it's still fucking amazing. A shining star that showing what the web could be.  
Damn that loaded fast...  
Oh wow, that's fast. The regular usa today is a garbage fire.  
I clicked on that and it immediately redirected me to the regular site. I guess it probably doesn't work for users in the US?  
The one fucking news site that has one, and only one, instance of javascript, holy shit.  
Can't access that in the states :(. Just redirects me to the US version   
damn i clicked on that and now i know demi lovato had an overdose   
Holy crap that response time, nice.  
https://eu.usatoday.com/ Yeah, it's one of the fastest news sites out there, it's almost like using Opera Browser 15 years ago.  
React baby. React done badly mind you.   
It‚Äôs so bad. It‚Äôs just so so bad.  I don‚Äôt know if they have intentions of making it more responsive, or if they plan on optimizing for browsers that aren‚Äôt chrome, but holy shit is it awful. I have a 2014 MacBook Pro, Safari has some of the best JS performance in the browser world, and the site crawls.  If I stay on it for more than idk 20min I lose about 1% battery every 2min.  It‚Äôs unacceptably bad. Reddit is supposed to be this techy wonderland, but they can‚Äôt make a responsive website. It‚Äôs a front page that serves text with thumbnails, w t f.  
It's slow because it's running a million background scripts that are tracking your mouse movements and how you navigate through the site. Reddit users always split down the middle in the camps of "Accept that change is going to happen, dont whinge" and "This fucking redesign sucks ass, how did you screw this up?" camps but boy howdy do those people who accept redesigns really chap my ass on this specific issue.   
The redesign wasnt done for the users, it was done for the company.   
Little tip, turn off adblocking and see just how quickly the adspace is loaded and populated and rendered compared to literally everything else. Gives you a hint as to what the function behind the redesign was.  
I browse on a fairly old laptop. The pageload goes roughly like this over the space of 20 seconds: - background panels are loaded, all either white or black depending on the theme - Things start rearranging - Things stop rearranging while a massive oversized advert loads - Title loads - Thumbnail loads - Everything stops while the advert resizes - Text loads about 10 seconds later Then I scroll and nothing really happens for a couple of seconds, and finally the page jumps about 2/3 down the loaded content and the 2nd ad renders, again halting everything. Finally after 20-30 seconds I have a usable page.  
I have a core duo from 2008 for youtube and new reddit almost breaks it.   
There‚Äôs a billion JavaScript widgets and things. Load up your browsers developer console and load up the JS tracker.  It‚Äôs n u t s. The page doesn‚Äôt ever stop. Safari straight up says ‚Äúthis page is making your Mac unresponsive we recommend you close it.‚Äù  The only other website I‚Äôve seen that warning on was one with a coin hive miner.  
Reddits design isnt material design, its just an abomination  
It could look good. It's just poorly implemented in both cases. There's a lot of design "rules" to Material that aren't being adhered to. Those "rules", although subtle, tie it all together and ties it into mimicking the physical world. Which is easier on the eyes and sensibilities.  
 There's a lot of design "rules" to Material that aren't being adhered to.  A core principle behind material design is that you understand the 'user story'... as in, you know precisely what the user wants to do and when they want to do it.  Good thing youtube and reddit know precisely how we all want to interact with their sites and aren't trying to push us to paid promotional content.  
Yeah, reddit did a poor implementation of a bastardization of it.  
I never understood the 'material design mimicking the physical world' part. Could someone explain how is it mimicking the physical world? It makes no sense to me.   
The basics of it is that the "layers" of a layout should interact as if they were pieces of paper on top of each other. The shadows should be consistent in they way they cast on the lower layers. Also, in the same way that you can't pass a piece of paper through another piece of paper, lower layers shouldn't just magically come to the forefront. Here it is in more detail and better explanation: https://material.io/design/environment/surfaces.html  
We used to have shadows that defined depth, then everyone said fuck it lets do flat design cause its 2012 and its cool. Then everyone said fuck it lets "imitate real world" and do shadows again. Give it two years or so, well go back to flat and its gonna be retro and cool again  
[deleted]  
Its about the right balance of white space.  Too much or too little looks bad IMO.  
On a high resolution desktop monitor, it's more whitespace than anything else with the reddit redesign. I don't know how you can overlook desktops when you develop using one.  
It's so poorly implemented that I didn't know it was supposed to be Material until just now  
Is that on the new reddit? I am using old.reddit.com - I tried to use the new reddit lookout but it is too ugly and useless. If they kill old.reddit.com then I am also gone; won't use the worse new thing. :(  
reddit's new design is way worse than the new YouTube.  
r/assholedesign  
Just change it back  
I just use an addon to tell youtube im using IE. It offers the old youtube version than.  
Am I the only one with self-destructing cookies having every video tab I open insta-refreshing in Firefox? New URL includes "&reload=9" as a parameter. Regardless let's not be too quick to call this embrace/extend, and see it for what it really is: blind fucking incompetence. It reminds me of the old Outlook.com before Outlook.com got awesome  
 Am I the only one with self-destructing cookies having every video tab I open insta-refreshing in Firefox?  I get this too; it's so damn annoying. I figured it was because of the ad blocking, or the userscripts I run, but now I'm thinking maybe it's just because I run Firefox.  
Agreed. Even in Chrome, Polymer is slow and finicky. When this feature is removed from Chrome, which it probably will be in the future, it's going to be hurt just as badly. Google really needs to listen to the advice it gave developers years ago, instead of discarding it when they realize they can't follow it out of their own incompetence.  
Amazing how 2010s google has become 90s Microsoft.  
[deleted]  
The Google worship has kinda made me sick for years.  I don‚Äôt use most of their products.  I certainly don‚Äôt use Chrome.  
8 trillion dollar fine by the e.u coming up   
You are joking but the state of YouTube on Edge (which is much worse than Firefox) is in my opinion close to simply blocking a competing browser.  
You think that's egregious? They practically killed Windows Phone:  Google refused to create an official Youtube app (or an app for any other Google platform, really) for WP8. Google blocked Maps access, even though Windows 8 and WP8 both used IE.   
I know :( I am typing this on a Windows Phone  
Now you know why apple maps exists  
I'm calling the EU üá™üá∫   
Chrome, the IE of XXI century.  
That is a sentence that could only be said by someone who doesn't have to deal with Safari's (particularly mobile safari) absolute insanity. Chrome has quirks because they're moving too fast. Safari is insane because Apple thinks they're 1998 Microsoft and outright refuses to implement modern specs and want absolute tyrannical control over their ecosystem.  
 Safari is insane because Apple thinks they're 1998 Microsoft and outright refuses to implement modern specs  They don't want the mobile web to get too good because it will interfere with the App Store. I generally assume any severe layout or rendering issues are intentional.  
That's very ironic and sad considering what the iPhone originally launched as. Native apps weren't even planned, HTML 5 was meant to be the future of mobile applications.  
From John Carmack's Facebook story about Steve Jobs:  Steve first talked about application development for iPhone at the same keynote I was demonstrating the new ID Tech 5 rendering engine on Mac, so I was in the front row. When he started going on about ‚ÄúWeb Apps‚Äù, I was (reasonably quietly) going ‚ÄúBooo!!!‚Äù.   After the public cleared out and the rest of us were gathered in front of the stage, I started urgently going on about how web apps are terrible, and wouldn‚Äôt show the true potential of the device. We could do so much more with real native access!   Steve responded with a line he had used before: ‚ÄúBad apps could bring down cell phone towers.‚Äù I hated that line. He could have just said ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt ready‚Äù, and that would have been fine.   I was making some guesses, but I argued that the iPhone hardware and OS provided sufficient protection for native apps. I pointed at a nearby engineer and said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you have an MMU and process isolation on the iPhone now?‚Äù He had a wide eyed look of don‚Äôt-bring-me-into-this, but I eventually got a ‚Äúyes‚Äù out of him.   I said that OS-X was surely being used for things that were more security critical than a phone, and if Apple couldn‚Äôt provide enough security there, they had bigger problems. He came back with a snide ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a smart guy John, why don‚Äôt you write a new OS?‚Äù At the time, my thought was, ‚ÄúFuck you, Steve.‚Äù.   
[deleted]  
Depends on the interpretation.  "Lacking really useful features we should really all have by now" goes to Safari. "The browser that web devs assume everyone uses so why bother testing on anything else" award goes to Chrome.   
"Don't be evil"  
If OP can find these many security holes in uber systems, I'm sure he can go further and find more. But this time, I sincerely hope he publishes those as a zero-day vulnerability.  
He did publish them. Reposting this HN comment comment here, which sheds some light on why he was paid $0 for these bugs:  These are low severity reports. The first two require difficult prerequisites for an attacker to exploit, and the last one was not proven to be a security flaw. #293358: it's not ideal that the certificate isn't pinned, but to exploit this an attacker needs to either install their own root certificate on the victim's device, somehow obtain a private key for a certificate already installed, or have a certificate authority misissue a certificate to them for an Uber domain used by the app. #293363: an attacker still needs to acquire the victim's X-Uber-Token somehow for this to be useful. It's also somewhat mitigated by the token being invalidated when the victim changes their password. #293359: as pointed out by Uber, no weaknesses in the token generation algorithm were actually demonstrated, and brute forcing the 2128 keyspace is infeasible. Also, the rudeness he displayed was petty and unhelpful:  given the fact that at least one of your system architects were apparently high when they designed and implemented your bearer token assignment process Not completely unexpected though, given the caliber of talent utilized by Uber such as the ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù group that you hail from. You would do well in government security consulting, for sure. Oh my God. Are you seriously the Program Manager for Uber's Security Division, with a 2013 psych degree and zero relevant industry experience other than technical recruiting? LULZ  All in all, rather a poor result for this vulnerability researcher.   
Not saying it excuses his cuntyness, but at least #293363 sounds fairly viable given the frequency with which people use public wifi and the infrequency they change their passwords (I can't recall ever updating mine, at least on Uber)  
Headers are encrypted through HTTPS, even when on public wifi. The only thing a middleman could see by eavesdropping is that you are talking to Uber, nothing about the data being transmitted.  
But for this to be of any use, you also need a vulnerability that exposes a valid X-Uber-Token of the victim to an attacker.

Unless you are an author and decide to leave a section "as an exercise to the reader."  
[deleted]  
Doesn't seem their guidelines requires there be another ticket. The problem doesn't have to be previously reported, simply previously known. If it came up in an internal meeting during development there's no ticket to link to.  
Well that's crappy. They have a fully general out for any legit bug: "oh no that's a dupe of something we can't link or even ID in our super secret list". They should hash previous bug reports and publish them so that they can verify "yep, it was reported before, here's the writeup, hash it, yep, see it was on the published list".  
That seems rather shitty. "I discovered this horrible exploit that allows anybody to log in as anybody else." "Oh, we discovered that six months ago in a private meeting and will eventually fix it in 2026.  DUPE KTHXBYE!  Fuck your money!"  
OP sounds like an asshole, but it doesn't change a thing for me.  
I don't care if this person is the biggest asshole to walk the Earth.  Work done is work done - period.   If I were this person and Uber decided to toss a couple grand to shut me up, I'd tell them to f'ing shove it.  You run a bug bounty program you should be prepared for: 1)  individuals lacking in charm and 2) paying for work (even 'bugs' that you might not think are) - why, to make everyone trust the (your) system.  Again:  These are not employees earning a steady paycheck - and as employees be expected to act nice to one another and show up to an all hands meeting.  Uber screwed up - not this person.  And any future person thinking that finding a flaw in Uber's system will net them dollar one - knows now that is simply not the case.    
Uber is such a shitbag company that I wouldn't blame him if he sold them instead.  No reason to be ethical with an unethical company.  
That's not how ethics are supposed to work.  
 No reason to be ethical with an unethical company  Not even to avoid fucking over their customers?  
The best way to protect their customers is to get them to stop using the malicious service. If the company can't get their act together, I see no reason for others to try and help them.  
You do realize that if you sell a vulnerability that leads to a data leak, it's already too late for Uber's customers, right? That's pretty much the worst case scenario, there's nothing left to be worried about after that  
If you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas. Uber has proven to be a deeply unethical company time after time, over years.  No one should be doing business with them.  
Do you really think the average Uber user has even heard about any of the BS that Uber gets up to?  
No one owes loyalty to Uber or their customers. They're in a business to sell services. They owe their customers a service and the security of their customer's information required for use of that service. The rest of the world owes them nothing. The fact that they have failed in their duty to protect their customers should be exposed and it will be exploited too. It's what happens when you have information that you don't protect. It doesn't matter who's information it is. If it's available it will be exploited.  Offering the bounty was literally asking for pen testing. The fact that they did it without doing it themselves first is monumentality stupid. Then saying that they knew about these issues before they were posted is rage inducing. They'll get what they deserve. Their customers I feel a little sorry for.   
Uber's customers are average human beings with no knowledge of Uber's shadiness. I'd say not stealing average people's IDs is basic common courtesy.

Right? Definition of integrity   
I don't live in the US and my choices are local corrupt lazy greedy bastard taxis, or Uber. So uber it is all day long. The instant Lyft or anyone else becomes an option though I am jumping ship. I don't know I would encourage publishing zero day options for any company like this, you are going to hurt their users more than you are going to hurt them. Even if they are complete dbags and deserve it.   
 my choices are local corrupt lazy greedy bastard taxis, or Uber.  The biggest difference between these two is that one is playing the long game   
Uber is bad but let‚Äôs not forget it‚Äôs HackerOne Uber is using for this service and HackerOne that isn‚Äôt helping this dude by backing up his claim with Uber. There‚Äôs two bad guys here.   
And this is how bug bounty programs die and companies get breached. I understand that you can't pay out for every tiny UI bug random people find (although I was impressed that GoDaddy paid out $50 to me once for what basically equated to a UI bug), but if someone has provided something so actionable you go and take a service offline, they've found something. The purpose of a bug bounty is to encourage ethical disclosure with the promise of payment by following the ethical route. Stop honoring that and people will start following the unethical routes to get paid for their work.  If this were me, I'd probably try to take them to small claims court. I'm not sure what BS arbitration rules this middleman website has, but I'm pretty sure in most jurisdictions you're entitled to unbiased arbitration at least. Or maybe reach out to the bounty program again? Show that you had actionable data and the company acknowledged the issue by fixing it, they should pay out at this point. I'd probably also tweet up a storm about it, companies get uptight about bad Twitter press these days, especially security stuff.  
 The purpose of a bug bounty is to encourage ethical disclosure with the promise of payment by following the ethical route. Stop honoring that and people will start following the unethical routes to get paid for their work.  You know what's weird and shitty though? If you follow the ethical route and disclose that, there's nothing stopping them from fixing it and not paying, or not paying but monitoring it, then when someone (say, the person that submitted it) decides to go about that business, you're screwed. Here's a cautionary tale here! It's so underhanded that you're basically at the mercy of them honoring their word. DEFINITELY make a scene about it. Share this far and wide. Make it the most expensive pay dodge they've ever made.  
The problem with that is that if you screw enough people, they're eventually going to screw you over the first chance they get.  Bug bounties exist to encourage programmers to "do the right thing" and  if it ever gets out that the bug bounty is a lie, there's nothing stopping people from going the black market route which isn't really what the company wants in the long term.  Unfortunately there are enough stupid people in these companies that they don't understand that there are consequences for treating people badly.  
I completely agree. At this point if anyone found an exploit in Uber, go nuts, I say. Don't hurt individual users, but anything else? Hey, they've made it pretty fucking clear they're not going to reward you in any way. Unfortunately, you could be the dude like this fellow that lost over a week with little to show for it but a cautionary tale.  
The other thing that I haven‚Äôt seen mentioned enough is the ridiculously low cost of these bounties. $500 is fucking peanuts to a company that size; and for someone with the skills like the security researcher in question, it doesn‚Äôt even remotely cover the normalized value of his time. Getting an actual pen testing consultancy firm with those kinds of chops in to do this kind of analysis would cost $500 an hour per consultant or more (your run of the mill infrastructure or development consultant might cost $300-400, this I know from having hired such firms).  Ultimately they‚Äôre lucky that this guy is a seemingly moral fellow because someone with a more black hat mindset would have just sold their exploits, pocketed a few tens of grands, and walked away.   
 there's nothing stopping people from going the black market route  Except for piddly little details like prison time and life-altering lawsuits.   
It's pretty sad when this happens. I have no clue about security (I'm just a lowly programmer) and many years ago I accidentally found a way you could play a popular MMO (Age of Conan) for free (Circumventing the monthly subscription). When reporting it I got a thanks from one of their senior GMs, that's it (And that was one of the bugs they actually fixed in a few days, instead of months, lol). Not even a free month of game time or anything, I'll never report anything again for free.  
Fine i'll ask Since they've fixed it, what was the bug?  
Something quite dumb: I had the habit to only buy one month of MMO subscriptions and immediately cancel the subscription afterwards (As to not forget to cancel if I no longer want to play). So I bought a month, my account was unlocked and I cancelled the subscription and played. Next day I couldn't log in. What actually happened: When you buy a subscription your account immediately gets unlocked. While you play there is no additional check if your account is still paid for, so as long as you didn't log out you could keep playing. When I immediately cancelled my subscription after paying this also voided the payment (It didn't go through). So I basically paid nothing and could play for over a day or more (Depending on when I logged out). If you wanted to abuse this system all you had to do was buy a subscription, log in, cancel the subscription and play for free as long as you want without logging out. Then just repeat as often as you want.  
Oh, even shittier is that some companies will try to take you to court, even if they're offering this sort of bounty, for finding security issues in their product.  
Yeah I'm assuming they just fix it and was referring to future discovered vulnerabilities or exploits.  
paypal once refused to honour a payout only because the guy who reported the bug was 17 and supposedly ineligible to use paypal, even though there was nothing on their bug bounty program that said you had to be 18 source  
PayPal is sometimes such a shitshow that it's hard to remember that Elon Musk is involved.  
I mean, Elon hasn't been involved in Paypal since 2002.  
Man, I'll always hate PayPal for stealing $100 from me back when I was broke as fuck in 2001 or so.  Presumably they don't just straight up keep your money and tell you to fuck off anymore, but they permanently lost me as a customer back then.  Hope it was worth the $100 to lose a dude who makes six figures and buys everything online!  
You think Elon can't be a shit bag?  
Look closer.  He is often an instrumental part of why a company is a shitshow.  Look at why he got ousted as the CEO of paypal.  
Most things Elon touches are successful shitshows  
Why? Blind Elon Musk Reddit Hard-on?  
I once worked for a hosting company that had an XSS vulnerability which allowed one shared hosting customer to inject and then control another customer's shared hosting account. The security team denied it was possible for months even though hundreds of customers reported it. I found the bug in my own time and reported it as confirmed. Again, they denied it as possible and berated me for reporting an issue that they already confirmed was not possible. Then, I made a step by step walkthrough of with screenshots on how I was able to gain control of another hosting account (a friend's account, with permission). In addition to sending it to the security team, I sent it to management. That's why I included screenshots and working examples along with notes on how to do it to ANY account. I also noted that you can still see my own Linux user and group IDs as the new files' owner in my friend's account which confirms the files were created via an XSS vulnerability because he can't create files with my Linux ID. That got a response. It was fixed within a weekend, but again I was berated about a week after that. This time management approached me and said that the "bug" was fixed, but IT security reassured them that my report was not possible. It was just a minor bug that couldn't possibly have affected customers. They also noted that the immediate stop of customers reporting XSS attacks was 100% coincidental. Again, because it was not possible. Also, I might be fired for hacking. Even though I did it with my friend's permission and good intentions, the company takes that stuff seriously. I wasn't fired. That was the last time i went above and beyond for that company.  
So they fixed it while it was not a bug and they wanted to fire you for hacking when it wasn't even possible? Did the security team also install Google Ultron for everyone?   
Hey, don't bad Google Ultron, it's what NASA uses.  
Yeah, I had a friend who once experienced some strange behaviours logging into his banking account online, I inquired deeper and discovered a fucking horrible vulnerability. I emailed said bank and told them I believe I have discovered a serious issue with their login system and asked if a bug bounty was available. I got a response back 10 days later saying they would forward it to the correct department and I never heard from back from them again lol.  He has since switched banks.   
After doing a bunch of attack simulations on various large US banks, this is not surprising to me at all. I've seen some interesting attack chains that led to a complete compromise of a bank's network, and then they don't fix it because it gets lost in the bureaucracy.   
[deleted]  
All in all, that's not too bad of a vuln but they should definitely fix it.   
So uhh... got any secrets to share?  
Nope. Lots of non disclosure agreements. I'd like to stay employed.  But  pretty sure all major banks have issues that could lead to a large compromise. Some just handle it better than others.   
[deleted]  
Nah, send an internal email to every bank employee using a vuln in their mobile banking app.  Someone's bound to do something, right?  
Yeah, like call the FBI lol.  
Yeah, sure, but a bank? You'd think they've have multiple people 24/7 monitor and testing their web digital infrastructure.

 (although I was impressed that GoDaddy paid out $50 to me once for what basically equated to a UI bug)  GitHub gave me $200 for an UI bug /bragging And a t-shirt  
Even still, $50 for a UI bug isn't exactly expensive. The average programmer is probably costing a company at least $50+/hr to employ.   
$50/hr is base salary. Add on the overhead that is bonuses, holiday, vacation, and sick pay, family leave, 401k matching, healthcare, benefits, Medicare and social security taxes, facilities (rent/mortgage, taxes, utilities, parking spaces, facilities maintenance, yard maintenance), plus overhead of support groups (management, HR, IT), depreciating assets (computers, monitors, networking equipment), and you'll find most companies operate at 2-3x base salary for total cost. So $50/hr base salary costs the company $100-150/hr. A $50 bug bounty payment doesn't even pay for a lunch break. A company will incur more than $50 having a security expert or dev read the bug and ask accounting to cut a check.  
The going rate for a senior engineer in the valley probably costs a company 200 per hour. That is just cake in comparison.  
[deleted]  
Yeah, but he is someone that needs to sit in a meeting for an hour while they discuss whether or not they want to fix the UI bug and how to fix it Big companies love their meanings  
This whole idea of siloed engineers that can't or shouldn't fix UI's or play with web is a dirty lie from lazy feckless people. You can have a UI bug or even poorly conceived UI that's easily worth $200+/hr  
a small thing, but you probably want to reference the average QA not the average programmer. the programmer is a cost regardless of the UI bug being raised or not  
In the United States, you are not entitled to unbiased arbitration, thanks to the Federal Arbitration Act.  
The bug bounty offering is just for keeping bad press off them as they pay off blackhats. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-21/uber-concealed-cyberattack-that-exposed-57-million-people-s-data

 If this were me, I'd probably try to take them to small claims court.  Can you imagine some Magistrate Judge sitting there glassy eyed as you attempt in vain to explain to him what you've done to prove you've found a security breach? Especially since the Defendant just needs to say, "We knew about that -- it doesn't qualify under our terms of a bug".  
Uber is one of the most unethical companies to have ever been founded.  They are right up there with PGE and East Germany.  I would not be surprised that if a person brought them to small claims court they either wouldn‚Äôt survive to the end of the trial or they would end up in jail instead for upwards of 20 years due to ‚Äúcomputer crimes‚Äù.  
https://twitter.com/infosec_au/status/945048806290321408 They dismissed his claim because he was an ass.  
Uber is such a shitbag of a company that this doesn't surprise me at all.  
UseLyft  
Lyft isn't available outside of US. Uber is in dozens of countries.  
They recently expanded to Canada!  
Only in toronto right now  
[deleted]  
Many countries have local app-based alternatives. I was in Spain, which has neither Uber nor Lyft, and used an app called myTaxi. It worked out pretty well, since it had the same basic features of Uber. I entered my destination and paid through the app, so I didn't have to know Spanish. One driver flaked on me while I was waiting for the cab, but that happens on Uber too.  
I deleted my Uber account and use Lyft exclusively now. It's pretty telling that literally every driver I've talked to who has driven for both had said Lyft treats them better.  
[deleted]  
Can you elaborate for someone who has no idea. Does it just pay better?  
I stopped using Lyft the moment they started sending ad push notifications to my phone with no option to disable them.   
I get Lyft pushes, but for coupons or free ride credits.

Explain to me how this company went from Reddit's golden child a few years ago to being a company that's the shittiest of bags? EDIT: People apparently don't like questions...  
I think this post is a pretty great example of how.  
Because Uber was the first company to try to solve a very real problem that exists in some cities (seriously fucked taxi regulation). While they were solving a real problem it turned out that at the end of the day their methods are even shittier than the taxi companies they're trying to replace, and they're very much in the business of fucking everyone but themselves.  
This response tells me literally nothing that they have done wrong... neither have any of the other replies?   
See this reply: https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/7m2z3b/how_i_got_paid_0_from_the_uber_security_bug_bounty/drr9dg1/  
Because we found out about all the shitty unethical stuff the company has done over the years.  
[deleted]  
I'm not defending Uber here, and this isn't really excuse to not pay someone, but the author is also not saying the full story. While he seems professional in his post, if you look at the actual reports, he sounds like a total asshole to complete strangers... Who says "LULZ" on a bug bounty report?  
[deleted]  
 technical recruiting  Found the problem  
Yeah it's 'Lulz' worthy but still a shitty thing to write to a person/company, especially when you're trying to get paid. It should be in the article, not in his bug report comments.  
[deleted]  
Seriously that wasn‚Äôt the initial report that was a frustrated reply...  
I agree, he is the one who started the personal attacks when he posted  Further, given the fact that at least one of your system architects were apparently high when they designed and implemented your bearer token assignment process without any ability to programmatically expire tokens, you have millions of bearer tokens floating around out there waiting to be discovered with this type of enumeration method, and with a bit more digging into your Oauth2 token assignment process I am confident that I can dump a few million of those unexpired tokens with a side project focused on modeling your PRNG output with a generative deep neural network after I capture a few hundred thousand Oauth2 tokens from your password reset process.  because he was (somewhat understandably) mad that they wouldn't pay him at least $500. I find it highly unprofessional, and I'm kind of not surprised he's an "independent security contractor" spending a lot of time on public bug bounties. Additionally, his comment about the generative net sounds like bullshit to me, as someone with a background in ML.  However, the lack of rate limiting actually is important and 100% a security flaw.   
 However, the lack of rate limiting actually is important and 100% a security flaw.  It's not. The auth token he's talking about is static per-user, changes with password resets, each user has exactly one, and are only used by first-party apps. They're not OAuth2 tokens, and he seems to know that so I don't know why he's calling them that in this article. Since we know that each user has exactly one token and it's composed of 128-bits of cryptographically random data (meaning it comes from a pool of 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 possible values,) we can figure out how many tries it would take to guess any token via exhaustive search. Assuming everyone on the planet has an Uber account: >>> print("{:,.0f}".format(((2**128)/7590515550)/2)) 22,414,970,674,879,813,525,541,224,448  Is roughly how many tries it would take on average to guess any valid token. No rate limiting necessary. Assuming you can try a single token per millisecond it would still take 71077405742262216 years to guess a valid one. There are valid technical criticisms of how Uber handles auth. Not ratelimiting when an invalid auth token is sent is not one of them.  
Ah I see, that's actually a good point. Assuming the tokens are entropically random (and we have no reason to believe they are not) you're right that even with billions of outstanding tokens and millions of guesses per second there's not even a remote risk of one getting cracked. I hadn't considered the magnitudes of scale like you have. So in a way that almost makes that a non-issue. I'd say it's still bad to let people try to brute force as a matter of principle, but in this case it's astronomically unlikely to cause a security problem.   
So, why go into this protracted debate on Reddit, when the ticket handler can just explain the situation like this?  I feel like the real problem is a communication breakdown and lack of explanations from Uber's staff.  
I guess I see this as he is not a contractor or an employee of the company, he is purely being used for his skills, and if every second word is "fuck" it shouldn't really impact his ability to get paid on a bug bounties program. His role is not really to be professional, he is choosing to report these issues to uber instead of selling them to someone else.  
Expecting digital mercenaries to have a corporate conduct is hilarious.   
He sounds like a righteous asshole though. While the personal attack is uncalled for, it's not incorrect. What is that person doing in that capacity? Aside from that, it seems in Ubers best interest to make public the worst of these tickets, so I assume this is the worst we are going to see.  
 While the personal attack is uncalled for, it's not incorrect.  Yes, however in the real world, no matter how right you are, if you're an asshole to someone they're not going to respond well to you.  Uber fucking sucks, for so many reasons I can't even list them within the Reddit character limit, but it really should not surprise anyone that people don't want to help them or be nice to them when they open by being an asshole, even if they are right.   
His replies were satisfying   
Assuming there isn't editing of the facts & details, this is incredibly stupid on Uber's part.   Normally it'd just be "stupid" for any other company - But this is a company who's just been in the news for being successfully blackmailed into paying $100k to prevent a massive data breach from going into the wild. Uber is the exact kind of company who should know what bug bounties are for - Rewarding & encouraging those who find critical vulnerabilities because it'd potentially cost them much more if successfully leveraged by a malicious party.  With this coverage, who in their right mind would find future holes in Uber's services and go "Y'know, I should give this to them rather than the blackhats offering premium"?  
For real.  And they're going to hand-wave all issues as "out of scope"?  Then make them in scope.  
From what I can tell Uber banned him for making comments like, ‚ÄúAre you seriously the Program Manager for Uber‚Äôs Security Division, with a 2013 psych degree and zero relevant industry experience other than technical recruiting?  LULZ‚Äù when his bugs were rejected. It does seem some of his reports were unfairly dismissed, but I don‚Äôt understand the HackerOne rules well enough to really say. They‚Äôve paid out over a million dollars all-time on HackerOne, for what it‚Äôs worth.   
The moral of the story: ethical hackers don't get paid while black hat hackers do.  
Didn't Uber pay a hack ransom and cover up it ever happened?...  
Yes, and they actually used this same bug bounty program to do it.  
So maybe this bug bounty was never intended to be used, they just made it to cover the blackmail payment. Now they have unqualified developers manning the bug reports and blanket denials until they can sweep the whole thing back under the rug.   
Twice.... as far as we know. And took them one year to disclose it.  
If OP is the author of article, sucks man. I wouldn't have disclosed it to them, until a contract was signed in writing. It seems like Uber is getting reports, then instead of paying out they just say "it's being fixed internally" and lying. On another note, certificate pinning is not an exploit, or vulnerability in many companies eyes.  
No I'm not the author just sharing.   
its not certificate pinning the way a normal fucking company would do it. its wildcard trust of cloudfront LOL. which is totally beyond fucked levels of stupid  
Would you willing to provide a little bit more information about what you mean?  
Imagine your bank, instead of requiring your ID fully matches your account, simply requires that the City field on your ID matches. This is like that.  
Uber's app apparently trusts anyone with an Amazon account.  
Slight correction, anyone hosting with AWS CloudFront. It costs money, but I‚Äôm pretty sure some CF stuff is included in the year of free tier services  
You can create a domain ending in cloudfront.com and anything you upload onto that domain will be trusted by Uber‚Äôs app. It‚Äôs absolutely insane. Anyone who can use Amazon can create a cloudfront domain.  
cloudfront, not cloudflare  
Uber?  Lying? Shirley, you can't be serious.  
I am Shirley and stop calling me serious.  
The intent is to provide security bounty hunters with a sense of pride and accomplishment for discovering different bugs.  As for bounties, we selected initial values based upon the fact we don't intend to pay them and other adjustments made to milestone rewards before launch. Among other things, we're looking at average per-bounty earn rates on a daily basis, and we'll be making constant adjustments to ensure that bounty hunters have experiences that are infuriating, unrewarding, and of course unattainable via HackerOne.  
I actually expect something like this from Uber. They are known to be less than ethical.  It seems HackerOne deserves just as much flack, though.  They are supposed to be arbitrating this and, to me, they have totally failed.   
 If I can pull a couple hundred thousand OAuth2 tokens by somehow figuring out how Uber expires issued tokens, then I can use some visualization tools to see if there are any patterns or attractors that emerge, which in turn can then be used with function approximation to try to guess some valid OAuth2 tokens.  It‚Äôs so unlikely a CSPRNG isn‚Äôt being used to generate tokens it‚Äôs not even worth mentioning and hurts the author‚Äôs credibility.  
Uber don't give a shit about people who work for them? Who knew! But seriously - this is very weak, and certainly deserves some attention.  
‚ÄúOP doesn‚Äôt work for Uber, they‚Äôre a third-party contractor‚Äù ‚Äî Uber‚Äôs douchebag legal team.   
The company that ignored laws and established itself everywhere without giving a crap is not honoring its agreements? How dare they! /s Uber can go to hell.  
Last straw. Just deleted my Uber account and selected the "No longer support company" reason. They've lost the $500 that they saved by not paying out in this bug bounty by losing me as a customer.  
I'm following your lead on this one. Bye, Felicia Uber. Used Uber for my short commute about twice a week for the last year and exclusively on the weekends. The math says they just lost around $400/year indefinitely. GG Uber.  edit: Did I just get blue pilled by Lyft?  
viclou <-- via HN 3 of the bug reports are now publically disclosed: https://hackerone.com/reports/293358 https://hackerone.com/reports/293363 https://hackerone.com/reports/293359  
Maybe you'd have better luck with the sweepstakes from a cereal box.  
So, what Uber and HackerOne are really saying is that if you find a security vulnerability, you should sell it on the black market, where you're actually likely to get paid.  
Might help if you weren‚Äôt a giant asshole to those triaging this.  https://hackerone.com/reports/293359#activity-2203160  
Use Lyft. They paid me $500 for disclosing a bug related to their Windows app :)  
Tl/DR fuck Hacker One bug bounties and go straight too the darknet markets. Two of these issues would have been worth significant coin if they hadn't been disclosed... Author could have made 3btc easily by selling the exploit, or 50btc+ by selling the harvested data (probably back to Uber lol) Sigh. This is why we can't have nice things.   
The whole idea behind Uber is fucking with people that work for them. This doesn't surprise me at all.  
Uber uses the Bug Bounty programme to funnel bribery money.  
Worth the read just for gems like   open mic night in their infosec department.  LOL  
Someone ELI5 why companies even try holding paid bounties with intentions to not payout? Isn't that playing with fire? Pissing off pros that break shit is calling for trouble, right?  
All to save $500 per security vulnerability? That‚Äôs madness.

I don't think uber gets to bail on their bug bounty just 'cause the reporter is an 'asshat'.  
Plenty of programmers have shit social skills. Still need to pay them.   If they took their shit offline it obviously wasn‚Äôt just a duplicate issue.   
As a developer, my own team dismissed my findings about security weaknesses in our application as long as I couldn't exploit them to break something. There was an unprepared SQL statement in the code that I spent a full day figuring out how to use to delete data because the value that was concatenated in the query was passing by such many layers of business processing before. It baffles me how people can consider themselves cautious about security when their vision of a security vulnerability is literally when something is proven to currently being broken. You're supposed to avoid reaching this point at all cost.  
Looks like we all still have careers.  
I'm so relieved at this news.  I'm also hoping that Google will still work on an alternative for Android development  
Kotlin is starting to take off  
[deleted]   What is this?   
Android is moving to OpenJDK which is Java specification. Its perfectly separated from Oracle.

NDK is full of swiss cheese holes.  If you can navigate around them it can be fine.  There's just some nasty bugs that can ruin your day/week if you aren't careful or knowledgeable enough in c to bail yourself out.  
I have this far fetched dream of WebAssembly getting bindings for most platforms and becoming the next platform that works anywhere. We could use it to write web servers, android apps, and browser code. As a low level bytecode, it'd be the target of various languages, which would make those languages inherently cross platform. I just think it'd be cool to see WebAssembly as a first class citizen for app development, as well as browser and server development. I think it's going to need its implementation of shared memory threading before any of that can happen, though.  
I definitely think its one of the main waves of the future. Pick your language, build for webasm, and move on with our lives. Run the same code almost anywhere.  
Wasn't that Java's selling point? You're just sticking a browser in there now.  
If webasm really takes off native apps will be less necessary.

till the next go-around  
Yeah, there will always be someone trying to screw things up. Today it was Oracle, tomorrow who knows. But one nice thing about all of this is that we now have an explicit confirmation that copying API declarations for interoperability purposes is fair use. So the next attack on openness will have to be something else, they can't use this nonsense a second time.  
 tomorrow who knows.  Probably Oracle again.  
God knows this is true. Fuck Oracle. Fuck Ellison in his slimy, adulterous face.  
This sounds like one of those cases that Oracle will keep hammering with minor variations until they get lucky. The judge this time did a huge amount of research into computer science, programming, and the Java ecosystem. The next might not be so thorough.  
Or they can appeal it, which Oracle says they will do in the article above. So far in Oracle v. Google cases, if memory serves, the court has found:  In favor of Oracle Overturned the original ruling and found in favor of Google Overturned that ruling and found that Oracle's claim to copyright APIs was valid Found in favor of Google that even though the API is copyrighted, it can be used for Android under fair use.  It's basically the legal equivalent of a tennis match as far as I can tell. It will be up to the appeals court to determine whether Oracle's appeal goes to trial again, and their lawyers are quite good. But for the time being at least, the outlook is good for the future of IT.  
What it really really really needs is to somehow produce a circuit split (it won't because Oracle is trying to take it right back to the Federal Circuit, which issued the "APIs are copyrightable" decision), so the Supreme Court will take it. The Supreme Court has been less than kind to the Federal Circuit's... let's say novel approaches to the application of IP law.  
 and their lawyers are quite good.  you'd hope so...  
Sorry to burst your bubble, but the whole reason this is being retried as a fair use case is because the Federal District Court ruled that APIs are copyrightable when Oracle appealed. The only way we win now is if Oracle appeals and it heads to the ninth circuit court, which is more tech literate as it's based in San Francisco.  
TBH, I was looking forward to the vacation.

 Oracle CEO Larry Ellison welcomed Android at first, but later he "Changed his mind, after he had tried to use Java to build his own smartphone and failed to do it"  Probably my favorite part in that article  
It probably wanted to install the Ask! toolbar.  
Actually Sun started the Ask! Toolbar bundling. Sun desiring money (since they were losing lots of it) likely agreed to a very long contract which likely expired in July of 2015 (which is when the toolbar was removed from the installer). When Oracle bought Sun, it is not like they can just say no to the business contract Sun and Ask! agreed upon.  
[deleted]  
That is pretty much the story of my time at Oracle.  "You're spending too much.  Find a way to cut costs.  If that means laying off good workers, fucking do it.  By the way, here are two hundred promotional Iron Man 3 posters that the studio gave us when we paid to place a goddamned Exadata Server in the scene with the news van.  Give them out to whoever wants one."  
3 billion devices run the Ask.com toolbar!  
 3 billion people forgot to uncheck the Ask.com toolbar part in our installer.   
Which is why you should use Unchecky...  
The Ask! Toolbar wasn't that bad... people forget about the Bonzi Buddy and WeatherBug days of yesteryear... they forgot the pain, the suffering, and the popups.  
I think Hooli was modelled after Oracle  
Hooli is a company with Google services mixed with Oracle incompetence and led by Salesforce's CEO.

Him having a spiritual guru mainly.  Also in the show there's a commercial with Gavin helping kids in africa.  Marc has done a lot of philanthropy there I believe. EDIT:  Apparently Larry Ellison also has an asian spiritual guru.  Guess it's par for the course for Silicon Valley CEOs.  
Sitting in the keynote for Dreamforce last year, I had the exact thought of 'Oh god, Salesforce is actually just Hooli.' It's the entire buy everything, do everything on our platform combined with the messaging style of Benihoff's doing good through technology.  
Hooli is a catchall to represent whatever the writers want to lampoon. No doubt Gavin Belson's guru Denpok is based on Marc Benioff's relationship with Deepak Chopra.  
its sad to know some rich people are paying money for Deepak chopra's spiritual guidance, when i can get his woo-woo bs for free on youtube.  
How would Java build a smartphone?  
With a Factory, of course!  
Take your upvote and get out.  
But who's gonna build the factory?  
AbstractSmartphoneFactoryBuilderImpl.java  
Given the corporate culture at Oracle and the fact that many talents are averse to the company and would never consider working there/quit as soon as they could, I am not surprised that they couldn't pull off building their own smartphone.   
"I can't do it with my own code so I don't want anyone else doing it!!'   
I was following this case closely because I once implemented a piece of code that had the same signature as java.lang.Math.min(int a , int b)  and was worried it might not be fair use.  
Just switch the order of the arguments.  
And introduce backwards compatibility issues?  No thank you.

Aaaaand no longer fair use.  
Can you imagine a world full of API squatters? It's like the asshole who copyrighted the Happy Birthday song.

Can someone explain this to non-programmer me?  
It's such a generic statement that its akin to a food company trying to trademark "It tastes good" as a slogan.   
Or copyrighting the use of onions in food.   
 Or copyrighting the use of onions in food.   I believe Schwartz did compare APIs to a burger menu when questioned by Oracle.  
No no, onions followed by celery. Remember, it's the fucking order that matters. This verdict came out sane and I find that I'm still pissed off about it because of the fact that it got this far.  
most programming languages have common functions that programmers can use, things that would be tedious to write and rewrite for every program they make, this is an api.  Most programmers use the ones bundled with the language without giving it much thought, as they should. This is because the api that comes with a language is often regarded as part of the language itself, sorta like living in a home without any furniture, a language without a decent api is almost unusable.  Oracle tried to claim it under copyright for Java if I'm reading the article correctly  
You're pretty close.  Google never used Oracle's library.  They developed their own limited subset of the Java library for compatibility.  All that Google used was the layout of the API. So both libraries had something like String foo(int bar) that did the same things however the inner workings were developed separately. Google didn't really take anything from Oracle.  It's kinda like suing someone over the names of a book's chapters.  
A technical manual on a car where the chapters are like  Transmission Wheels Doors  etc.   
Upvoted for "the names of a book's chapters" 10/10 would sue again  
Imagine an API as a menu. It can have hamburgers, salads, soups, and so on. However, each restaurant will have their own version of each food item. These different versions are the different implementations. The poster was saying: I made something called a hamburger, and I was afraid of McDonald's suing me for calling it a hamburger.  
It's a huge victory (and one that was not so obvious) but this case is still not as significant as the fact that API's can be copyrighted, which is the law today. Google was able to dodge that bullet by winning on fair use grounds, but this is not universally applicable and it won't help the next company being sued for API copyright infringement. The real battle is to overturn the ruling that API's can be copyrighted.  
This is only a moderate victory for common sense. It shouldn't have got this far, as the API itself shouldn't have been copyrightable in the first place.  
If it were up to the Judge, it wouldn't have. Judge Alsup did a commendable job in presiding over this case, going so far as to learning to program in Java, familiarizing himself with contemporary software development practices, and how APIs are built, shared and used to ground himself in the principles he needed to grasp to properly interpret the law. In his original decision, after learning to code and what APIs are all about, he came to the decision that Oracle's copyright was invalid in the first place. That decision was later overturned on appeal, but nonetheless he has shown tremendous motivation to fully understand the questions brought to his courtroom.  
Wow, now there is a guy that I can respect.  That goes well beyond what he is required to do.  If more judges and politicians had that mindset the world would be a better place.  
Maybe, it could also be a worse place overall despite better court rulings because of a huge drop in case turnover rates due to all the extra effort everyone's putting in. Hard to tell

Kind of shines a spotlight on how arbitrary our justice system is.  It depends heavily on judges and juries being well-informed and having common sense.  A single judge gets this decision right,  but apparently a panel of appeal judges fuck it up.

Speak for yourself, I'm infallible.  
My fav part is when he got it right. He called APIs a process and procceses like ideas can not be copyrightable.  
It must be so embarrassing to be a developer at Oracle, knowing this is bullshit, and they just keep dragging it out. Sitting there just trying to hide the shame, unable to do anything, wanting it to stop.  
When Gemalto sued Google because they have a patent for running high level code in a mobile device, I quit my Job. Also, when a recruiter offers me a Job working for Oracle, I tell them, sorry, but I do not want to work for that company.  I think people care about this things.  
I guess everyone has their price but I cannot imagine ever working for Oracle. They seem to have a compulsion to fuck up everything they touch, especially when it comes to open source projects. Plus the whole company just exudes an air of scumminess that's really extraordinary even for American corporations.  
It's not just price. It's looking at your long term career. A company that makes insane decisions like SEC and Oracle do is not going to be successful for long and you'll be out of a job to reduce costs, or outright scapegoated. And who is going to hire you? "I see you worked for one of the most hated companies in the industry. All of my staff them write hate mail every week. But I'm surely not going to think any less of you subconsciously when I see your resume in the stack."  
I have a friend who works for Oracle.  She is very nice.  She talks about her team trying to make sure they help their clients and do the right thing for them.  Just so you know...  Oracle is a big place.  It is likely similar to all big things; some good, some bad.  
Ha Gemalto are a shower of bastards. I worked for one of their competitors, they tried to get us sued by Oracle by telling them we didn't have certain licenses.    
Was let go from Oracle recently. Spot-on; management is being dumb, everyone knows it, many people are thinking of leaving.  
 Was let go from Oracle recently.  Congratulations.    
In fact, many top developers of Java have left Oracle over the past year bc of their actions.   
It's amusing to think about but I don't think the average developer inside Oracle cares very much. If anything he just has to play along (like in all office jobs) and lament about how unfair the verdict was to Oracle.  
There was a NPR/Planet Money/This American Life investigation a few years ago into tech patents and patent trolls. They talked to a few software engineers in Silicon Valley who had patented their work, and some even said that they didn't know what their patent said. It's tech jargon filtered through legal jargon, and it comes out as nonsense. But I don't think they did any sort of survey of the feelings of the whole community. They probably just talked to the ones that were most willing to talk.  
Oh god. I remember that episode. Pretty sure it was TAL. The CEO of the big patent troll company lied through his teeth the entire episode. Fucker said that patent troll wasn't even a thing, and that he definitely wasn't one and he was just protecting his rightful intellectual property. Even tho his company did nothing. They contributed to society in literally no way whatsoever. Just acquired patents and sued people who barely even did anything related to their patents at all.   
 the API itself shouldn't have been copyrightable in the first place.  This. It's like trying to copyright the Dictionary and then suing someone for writing a book - in my humble opinion. Also, that's the best metaphor I could think of.   
I personally prefer the analogy of an API being a restaurant menu. Google copied some of the dishes names, sure, but they used their own recipes for them and cooked the food themselves. It's just helpful for customers to see "Cheeseburger" and have a rough idea of what it'll be, even if they know the details of the ingredients and preparation will probably differ.   
Clear to people in /r/programming, but not clear to judges, lawyers, laymen etc who don't really know what APIs are. Now it's on the records, the precedent set by this is important to have on the books.  
 Oracle wanted to sue for $9 billion Accused Google of stealing 11,500 lines of code.  That's $782,608 per line. I should ask for a raise.  
I've done some costly lines in my youth.  
Thank God. Hopefully this sets up at least some sort of precedent for the future. It shouldn't have gotten this far, but it could be a lot worse. I'm thankful the legal system didn't fail us today.  
This doesn't really set any binding precedent. (Jury verdicts seldom do.) The district court and the appeals court that covers the west coast already agree with Google on the API copyrightability issue. Oracle managed to get the case before the fucked up Federal Circuit instead of the Ninth Circuit by including some patent infringement claims, but the Federal Circuit can't set precedent on copyright law. That's probably part of why the Supreme Court declined to hear Google's appeal: the consequences of the Federal Circuit's bad ruling would only affect this one case.  
What scares me the most is how easily it could have gone the other way. This verdict was found by a jury with lacking computer and comp.sci-skills to put it mildly. Oracle kicked out all the computer people in the jury in the preselection. Which makes me wonder.. did the jury reach their conclusion rightfully based on knowledge about the software development field and the merit of the arguments, or from a more shallow point of view as in which company they like the most? A broken clock is right twice a day as the saying goes.

Bingo. This is why expert testimony is used.  You wouldn't necessarily dismiss a jury's ability to decide on a murder case because they aren't knowledgable in forensic sciences.  Instead, you bring in experts to explain it to them in layman's terms.  
 You wouldn't necessarily dismiss a jury's ability to decide on a murder case because they aren't knowledgable in forensic sciences.  True, yet I still think the implications of murder is much easier to grasp for non-experts than copyright lawsuits. People don't generally need to learn how murder hurts people or society, because it is obvious. But copyright infridgment and attacks on the freedom of information can also hurt individuals and society; it's just more abstract.  
The jury is not deciding policy issues; they are just deciding whether the facts before them meet a legal standard the Court instructs the jury on.  The jury should not be considering broader implications of the case they are finding facts for.  
Oracle can eat a fucking dick.  
Fuck oracle.  
/r/fuckoracle? edit: i'm gonna nip this in the bud. yes it's not a thing, and yes, someone will make it a thing soon.   
It's a thing now. As of 3 minutes ago  
finger guns  
Does one more voice in a choir numbering in the millions even count? Well, just in case it does: go fuck yourself Oracle, suck a planet made out of dicks.  
Wow. That's a lot of dicks.  
They're a big company.  
So everyone, let's recap. Where it says this in a source file or header file, you get a lawsuit for using it: * Copyright (c) 2002, 2010, Oracle and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.  However where it says this, and you have a shitload of money, you stand a good chance of winning the third time. * This code is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it * under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 only, as * published by the Free Software Foundation.   
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought Google didn't actually copied Oracle's actual source code.  But what they did is use function and class names that used the same names as Java's in order to allow developers to write software that follows the same standard so that it's compatible.  But all of the actual implementation of those functions was done from scratch by Google.  No?  
Yes, google did like 99% their own implementations, and the very little bit they did steal, the judge (in the first case) said that the code was trivial enough that there was really no other way to write the code and it wasn't infringement. However, the APIs themselves, while being an abstract arrangement, have to be written down in the first place. If I read a book, and then try to write my own version of that book only from memory, have I engaged in plagiarism? What if all the chapter names are the same? What if I hire a guy, who's never read the book, and only tell him the chapter names? These are very grey areas in copyright law.  
In my mind, the analogy is more like a math textbook. There can be 10 different calculus textbooks, they all implement the derivative (in this analogy a function from the API) with no issues, but it is on the author to provide their methodology and reasoning (the function implementation)   
The best example i've seen is the API is the table of contents in the book, which are largely unoriginal, and the implementation is the actual story. No matter how new the story is It's Been Done and  Tropes Are Tools.  
Can someone explain the technicalities of the situation?  So Google took Java and reimplemented it.  Then Oracle who bought out Sun and thus owns its Java implementation thinks it has a copyright on Java and thus Google illegally used it?  By API are they talking about the language itself? Edit: ELI5  
Google created a clean-room implementation of Java, so they did not reuse code from Oracle/Sun. However, in order for Google's implementation to be compatible with Oracle's implementation, Google had to copy many of the APIs that are part of Java's standard library.  Think HashMap, ArrayList, ThreadPool, and stuff like that. This code just says that, for example, there is a collection called Stack and it has methods push, pop, and peek; it does not say how the push, pop, and peek methods actually work. Oracle sued, claiming Google required a license for the APIs because they were copyrighted. A federal appeals court has agreed with Oracle that APIs are copyrightable. Thankfully, today, the jury decided that copying an API is fair use, which makes sense because it is the only way to create a compatible implementation.  
That makes more sense.  Out of curiosity, is Oracle suing over the interface of the language itself or the APIs of the standard library? In any case, I'm also glad Google won.  There would probably be some pretty bad implications if Oracle won...  
An API is just an interface. It's just "A way of Plugging In." You can sort of think of it as a design for a plug. Lots of plugs are designed to be licensed out and made by different people all across the industry, so different things can be plugged in together.   
On a lighter note, AT&T's copyright claim on empty source files is on shakier ground than ever.  
I'd like to thank Judge Alsup for the public service he has provided throughout the last 5 years. He has done an amazing job on the entire trial, and the one before it. He was went as far as learning Java to understand the entire case. It's too bad it was all ruined by idiots in the appeals court, who probably know jack shit about programming...  
So Oracle and Gawker got slapped in court in the same week? This is too good to be true.   
I've been waiting to see this post. I've been dreading this post but with Oracle winning it.  
As it should be. Oracle is a cancerous tumor.   
It's that easy? Sorry, SCO has led me to expect these kinds of lawsuit to drag out for a decade. Better question, though: If I understand it correctly, this outcome implies that using a header file is Fair Use. What does this mean for restrictive copyleft licenses like the GPL, which (iirc) demands that software must be released under a compatible license for even linking to GPL software? A dynamically linked binary would contain at most header information from the library it links to. If that can be done under Fair Use without permission from the copyright holder, then are these license terms unenforceable?  
This is the best tl;dr I could make, original reduced by 71%. (I'm a bot)   SAN FRANCISCO-Following a two-week trial, a jury has found that Google's Android operating system does not infringe Oracle-owned copyrights because its re-implementation of 37 Java APIs is protected by "Fair use." During the trial, Oracle argued that Google copied 11,500 lines of code, including parts of Java API packages as well as related declaring code, in order to take a "Shortcut at Oracle's expense." As Android prospered, Oracle's Java licensing business, centered largely around feature-phones, cratered. Oracle CEO Larry Ellison welcomed Android at first, but later he "Changed his mind, after he had tried to use Java to build his own smartphone and failed to do it," Google attorney Robert Van Nest told the jury.

TheLastSentenceWasNecessary  
I have always said it, and I will say it again - FUCK ORACLE. Their CRM is shit.  
Seriously, ‚Äúfair use‚Äù? So no verdict about copyrightability of APIs, maybe even the opposite. Meh, I‚Äôll take it.  In 2012, following a first jury trial, US District Judge William Alsup ruled that APIs can't be copyrighted at all, but Alsup's opinion was overturned on appeal. At this month's trial, Google's only available argument was that the 37 APIs constituted "fair use."   
APIs are copyrightable according to the successful appeal by Oracle...that's already established  
Sort of, in a way that's only binding if you have an ancillary patent question in any phase of your trial.  
It's not even necessarily binding in that case. The Federal Circuit's opinion is based on "this is what we think the 9th Circuit would do, based on the things they've said in the past." If the same issue comes up from another geographical circuit, even the Federal Circuit wouldn't be bound by its previous decision. And, for the same reason, the 9th Circuit could rule on this issue definitively on its own, unbound by prior Federal Circuit precedent.  
That was decided on appeal before it was set back to the lower court.  It wasn't up for debate.  
Hooray, a jury ruled in favor of the completely obvious.  It was a frivolous suit, that wasted everybodies money.  Thanks Oracle.  
Suck it, Larry Ellison.   
Take That, Larry.  And I hope your America's Cup yacht sinks in the polluted waters off of Manhattan.  
Maybe google should understand their hypocrisy and stop fucking with "fair use" on YouTube.  
The YouTube bullshit is largely mandated by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.  
Thank god  
Temporarily. I'm sure Oracle will win on appeal again in a year or two. They've shown themselves quite adept at manipulating higher courts into doing their bidding, and those higher courts have already demonstrated that they give exactly zero fucks about Alsup's educated opinion. Congress really should be passing some sensible legislation on the subject, that carefully balances the interests of society as a whole in this matter. Too bad they're more interested in bombs, bogeymen, and bathrooms.  
[deleted]  
So everything's worked out alright in the end.  
Well, until the appeal. And ideally, copyright wouldn't be a question in the first place.  
Now that the server seems to be under control, let me high-jack my top comment to give you some tips:  You can edit the code live! Try changing a few numbers Click the "New Dweet" button to get a less crazy starting point. It even has some comments! If you edit someone elses dweet, you can post it directly from their post; this tags it as a "remix" and is preferred over just copy-pasting into "New Dweet" as it preserves the link to the original. dwitter.net/random is a good way to see dweets of variable complexity and dwitter.net/new is where all the fresh redditor dweets have started to pop up :D   And it's a ton of fun to see all the excitement :) Might have to get back to working on it.  (github.com/lionleaf/dwitter if you want to contribute) Edit: /u/xen_the posted a guide worth checking out if you're interested in making your first dweet! https://redd.it/7mgcd1  Edit 2: I've set up a discord for discussing all things dwitter: https://discord.gg/emHe6cP Old post: Hi guys! Creator here, it seems you've crashed it. Currently working on getting it stabilized again. I'll come back here and post some of my favorites when I'm not in such a hurry ;) Update: I think we're good! Threw a bunch of hardware at it, which helped a bit at first, but then the extra caching added by my friend seems to be more than enough for the current load :D   
Thank you, this is the coolest thing I've seen since ShaderToy. That raindrop one https://www.dwitter.net/d/1494 is like an update to the old rain program that did something similar on old text terminals. This is awesome.  
 u(t) is called 60 times per second. t: elapsed time in seconds. c: A 1920x1080 canvas. x: A 2D context for that canvas. S: Math.sin C: Math.cos T: Math.tan R: Generates rgba-strings, ex.: R(255, 255, 255, 0.5)  Is this not cheating or are these defined by some dwitter library for instance?  
 Is this not cheating or are these defined by some dwitter library for instance?  Yea, it's the rules of the game. I was severely confused how all of this is possible in so few chars of code but you get a base library and starting point to work with.  
Yes, exactly. It all started with a friend building arkt.is/t (which embeds the code in the url, like [0]. Move the mouse over the canvas to edit the code). They are still compatible, and we've decided to stick with those specific rules to keep it consistent. There's also a lot of missing boilerplate code, so it's not really a "140 character javascript program" as claimed by the title. It's more of a "heres a canvas 140 characters, along with a tiny library. Show me what you've got!" :) [0] http://arkt.is/t/Yy53aWR0aD0yZTM7bT1TKHQqMikqMjUwO3gudHJhbnNsYXRlKDk2MCw1NDApO2ZvcihpPTE7aTw5Nzk5O2krKyl7YT0oaSUzNDApO3gucm90YXRlKC4wMTcpO3guZmlsbFJlY3QoYT8oaS85OTl8MCkqNTA6MCxtLGE/NTo0NTAsMyl9  
Also check out GLSL Sandbox.   
What was your reaction when you saw the spike in traffic?  
My first reaction was "huh, is digitalocean doing some maintanance? Why did I get an email saying the site went down for two minutes?"  And then some friends pinged me about tweets and reddit. Setting up new relic now and hopefully I'll get an email earlier next time :P  Source at github.com/lionleaf/dwitter btw :) Pull requests welcome :D  
Well congrats on the Reddit hug of death! Milestone completed!  
It's the new version of being Slashdotted!  
"fuck, my site is about to go down"  
 "fuck, my site is about to go down"  FTFY  
Cool site! Is there a license agreement for the snippets? I'd love to use some of them as loading icons on my site (with attribution).  
That is a really good question! Definitely need to add an explicit license, and it's currently a discussion on it. If you have a specific dweet your interested in, ping me with their username and I can see I can put you in touch. If you get approval it would obviously be ok no matter the license :)  
Second related question.  If I wanted to use these on my site what librar(y/ies) would I need to include to get the effects?   
The dweets are embedded in an iframe, so you can get the full source from https://dweet.dwitter.net/id/701?autoplay=1 <--- the page that gets embedded. The source is also on github.com/lionleaf/dwitter There aren't any libraries, you just need to define a few functions. If you use it make sure you use your own dweets or attribute the author (and leave a comment on the dweet). I did a quick extraction of the javascript you need to recreate it, replace {{ code }} with the dweet code. (It was edited in the reddit comment box, so might have errors) c.width = 1920; c.height = 1080; var S = Math.sin; var C = Math.cos; var T = Math.tan; function R(r,g,b,a) {   a = a === undefined ? 1 : a;   return "rgba("+(r|0)+","+(g|0)+","+(b|0)+","+a+")";   }; var x = c.getContext("2d"); var time = 0; var frame = 0; function u(t) {    {{ code }}   } function loop() {   requestAnimationFrame(loop);    time = frame/60;   if(time * 60 | 0 == frame - 1){     time += 0.000001;   }   frame++;   u(time);  } loop();   
Doesn't appear to be any sort of license on the individual posts, or EULA on the registration that would imply one, so everything's copyrighted to the original author of each post.  
Exactly, that's the problem currently.  
you have permission for mine :-) take your pick: https://www.dwitter.net/u/Xen

Hehe, it's not kind on your battery, I'm sure.  
This is so cool!  
Working fine now!  
Very cool and wonderful but it is very easy to crash the browser when live tweaking...   
Haha, yes. Sounds like you ran into the good old infinite loop. A helpful trick is to change a for statement to 'fr' or something while editing the for loop and then put the o in the 'for' at the very end when you're certain you won't run into an infinite loop. Hopefully we can solve in a better way at some point.  
So are you going to change the character limit to 280 ;)  
this is amazing. Thank you for putting in the hard work! :)

I think we crashed it.  
The code for their load balancer was only 140 characters long.  
And written in Javascript.

Hey guys! Creator here. Thanks for the big cuddly hug of death! Quick update: We've added some extra caching in various parts of the system and thrown some more hardware at the servers (yey for cloud technology!). It seems to be back up, but it should've scaled a lot better so I'm not confident it stays up quite yet. Investigation ongoing :) Edit: This is a small side project that was living on the smallest digitalocean droplet ^ Edit 2: Went down again even with the bigger droplet for a bit, but added more caching and it seems to be up again!  
This is so cool! I want to sit down and decipher every single one now  
how do you mirror these to experiment with them? I copied the full screen page code, but nothing displays :-(  
What do you mean mirror them? If you just want to play with remixing a dweet, you can just edit the code directly in the field under the visuals. If you have a user there should then be a button to post it as a remix if you're happy with the result Beware! An infinite loop will crash your browser window and you might lose progress  
We did it!  
Hug of death.   
We added caching; now we're back up!  
402 bad gateway  
Can anyone explain how you start making something like these?  
You start with verbose and readable code and then you start stripping it down and fitting it into 140 chars. Also, you have to understand maths, mod operation and then you just have to get creative.   
I recommend looking into codegolf (e.g. codegolf.stackexchange.com), here is a nice challenge of this site that did exactly that (unfortunately closed now): https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/35569/tweetable-mathematical-art  
good ol' stack overflow with its heavy handed "because i can" moderation  
[deleted]  
The mod community is offended by the implication that their activity should take users into account. Users exist only to be moderated.  
It‚Äôs almost like Reddit that way.   
I could swear there's an entire chapter of game graphics left unexplored, somewhere in the intersection of the graphics demo scene and classic world rendering techniques. The closest I've seen so far is a the painter-y style of a game called Love. One (barely playable) example, but makes me wonder: Where are all the other games even trying that?  
Any good math resource for developers? (book or something)  
Programming involves lots of logic and discrete math, and graphics involve lots of trigonometry (and more of course). Try reading wiki articles on some of the stuff you're interested in, and when you don't know how to proceed, click on one of the related articles   
a good place to learn fundamentals of linear algebra (essential for creating representations of higher dimensions, eg 3D graphics or statistical modeling) is the 3Blue1Brown‚Äôs Youtube playlist. His channel also goes over fundamentals of calculus, fractals, analysis, etc. But its all pure math. For more CS applied math you‚Äôll have to look elsewhere  
There is a book about exactly this kind of stuff.  
!RemindMe  
What confuses me is that it seems like they're using variables without declaring them? Idgi. Edit: nvm, explained below!   
Yeah the stripping down part is a little bit of a downside IMO, but I don't know a better way to enforce "small" Kind of would rather read a few clear lines   
But that's the whole point, right? If you did it by line length you'd get people cramming a ton of stuff onto a line instead. (Actually, you'd want number of statements, because you can otherwise just have one arbitrarily long line...) Either way, it's going to get confusing fast, because the idea is to be as clever as you can to fit in as much content as possible in a confined space - and cleverness is the enemy of readability.   
Simple example: function u(t) {         /* Will be called 60 times per second.          * t: Elapsed time in seconds.          * S: Shorthand for Math.sin.          * C: Shorthand for Math.cos.          * T: Shorthand for Math.tan.          * R: Function that generates rgba-strings, usage ex.: R(255, 255, 255, 0.5)          * c: A canvas.          * x: A 2D context for that canvas. */      c.width=2e3;x.fillRect(150,150*S(t)+150,150,150) }   
2e3    TIL  
what is that?  
A way to write 2000 (4 characters) using 3 characters. Crucial in minification.   
Scientific notation, short for 2x103, or 2000  
2e3 = 2 * Math.pow(10, 3) = 2*103 = 2000  
scientific notation, meaning 2*103 = 2000  
For a more general solution to the problem of JavaScript numeric literal minification, you might find this library useful.  
I like how the comments define things that don't even get used  
Well, what... That's standard documentation ;)   
Also can‚Äôt you get the context from the canvas?   
Well, yeah, in the same way you could write Math.cos instead of C. But the point is to be under 140 characters, and x is provided...  
Yup, looks just like professional commenting  
So i take it there's a significant library you're allowed to assume?  
Why? The site is down now but I think most in there weee done with the above shortcuts and other core operations   
But where is S(x) = sin(x) defined? Not within the 140 characters as far as I can see.  
 x.fillRect(150,150*S(t)+150,150,150)  How do you know what the standard functions there are for JavaScript? Like fillRect seems like such a specific function, is there an entire library of functions that we could use? And I want to do something similar in Python. Is there any recommended canvas and drawing libraries of python just like seemingly in JavaScript?  
Take a look at the Canvas API: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API  
The code on the site looks really really complicated partly because it is minified to the max and partly because it is. To mitigate the first part, copy it into another text editor (recommend Notepad++ for Windows and Nano for Linux) and add proper spacing, indents, et cetera. Then go through and rename some or all of the variables to something more human friendly.  Often there is only one (maybe two) root values that "drive" the whole thing. This is usually the iterator value in the highest (first) enclosing for/while loop. Identify this then you can work through the program to see how it chouches.  The output that is displayed is done with JavaScript's canvas drawing utilities which are fairly straight forward. These are very well explained by W3Schools. The interesting stuff in the middle that makes the pretty pictures is maths. Specifically an equation or set of equations through which the driving value is passed. Remember all those weird, esoteric mathematical functions from highschool that seemed to be of no use at all? Well this is where they can earn their keep. JavaScript implements a pile of them for you to easily access (sin, cos, Pi, etc.) so you don't need to know many of them by heart, just (vaguely) how to use them.  That should start you off but if you have any more questions I'm happy to help.

Yes, I've been chatting with a majority of the top 'dweeters' for a while. And they definitely spend a lot of time hand-optimizing the code. That's the fun part of the game anyway

Have they upped it to 280?  
Looks like it's all the way up to 502 now.  
ayyyyy   
I kinda want to see what can happen at 70 as well  
Demoscene is back in JavaScript form.   
Demo scene never went any where. One form is 64k demos.  
4K best K though  
U/Lionleaf who made dwitter is part of my demogroup "Ninjadev". We work mostly in JavaScript with WebGL. Here is a link to our most popular demo so far, but maybe that's about to change as we are currently putting the finishing touches on our demo for Under Construction in two days from now :)  
That is awesome. I wonder if WASM would make these things larger or smaller...  
bruh there's still people coding C64 demos  
this one though...  
What the henk is this: Âçä  
Beagle Bros, who wrote software for the Apple II back in the day, would have two-liner contests where people had to do something cool in two lines of AppleBasic. They would include them in their newsletters. They were pretty amazing (and usually inscrutable) but one that stood out for me would simulate a train by revving the floppy drives back and forth faster and faster.

Thank you :) I guess you can't please everybody.   
Don't worry, I though it was funny too :)  
You're being downvoted by newbies who don't realize that the short circuit syntax in your joke would work.  
Phew, I was afraid I used the wrong indentation type for a second ;)   
Three and a half spaces is God's own indentation format. A tab and two spaces is Satan's.  
That's some magic they've got over there. Nice.  
Yup. Although it occurred to me that if 140 "characters" includes Unicode, you could probably do some amazing stuff with multi-byte characters.  
That's actually why Twitter is raising the tweet length limit - some languages can put a lot more meaning into 140 characters. Oddly, that still being true at 280 doesn't seem to have sunk in yet.  
It's crazy how much information you can put in 140 characters in Japanese. One character for a specific word, few more for grammar, no commas or spaces required (though often used), each tweet can fit a paragraph in English.  
If you went full Classical Chinese (which is even more packed than normal Chinese, which is already more semantically packed than Japanese), you could probably write a whole fleshed out essay in 140 characters.  
I think the idea is that 280 is long enough that you probably don't need to spend a ton of work shrinking what you're trying to say. If it's effectively infinite, then the fact that it's more-infinite in Japanese doesn't matter. I don't know how I feel about that -- I never did much with Twitter myself, but I got the feeling that being forced to express yourself so concisely actually helped people clarify their thoughts, and is a huge part of what defined Twitter as a medium.  
At last! An organic way to work Base2048 (385 bytes per Tweet) into the conversation.

/r/tinycode (and the subreddits in its sidebar)  
Anyone here remember portal.hell.com?  (may have been portal.hell.net) It was essentially a collection of really cool and innovative website designs back in the late 90's.  It was a major source of inspiration while I was in high school and people were making Geocities websites to share with their friends. At the time, I was pretty adept at qBasic at the time and I learned SO much about web design from reverse engineering the code on some of those websites.  
I don't remember that, but I remember a website called... Dr. Ozone's something or other, maybe? A lot of nifty javascript trickery.  
http://www.ozoneasylum.com/  
Is there anyway I can make sense of the 140 character code that is written? How can experiment, test and run these codes myself?  
Try editing the code directly in your browser ;) Start with the number. (Watch out for infinite loops!) Also, there's a commented basic example if you press the "New Dweet" button  
Thanks for the link, I now have a fun new way to waste my life.  
I wonder if experienced programmers can tell what an image will look like just by looking at the code.  
Sounds lame as fuck  Clicks ... THIS IS COOL AS FUCK  
and TIFU by introducing reddit to a community called "dwitter"  
I wish I had the motivation to learn code, it's so cool and seems like modern magic.   
To get interesting visuals you need to have good math knowledge (or steal from internet, still need to know what to search and have imagination on how to compose them). The code itself isnt much more than a formula and a few javascript canvas api calls.  
I wish I had good math knowledge and knew what the end of the comment ment  
 The code itself isnt much more than a formula and a few javascript canvas api calls.  It's mostly just maths and some built in functions that draw the result of the maths to an image.  
Javascript is a programming language commonly used in browsers to make them do stuff. "Canvas" is the digital analogue to a drawing canvas and an API is the means to manipulate that canvas (application programming interface). So they're saying that the coding part is partly just the necessary calls to make the math show up on the screen as something visual.  
https://processing.org/tutorials/  
Just have fun tinkering. Try changing some of the numbers and operators, you'll get more knowledge that way and then you can start creating your own designs. Obviously trig knowledge would help a lot but you can learn that as you go along.  
You should check out the demo scene. Search 64k Demos.

I‚Äôve always loved this creative visual coding stuff,the 140char limit is a nice idea but I‚Äôd like to learn some of the techniques involved which is harder with the minimised code

Look up 'code golf'  
Aaaaand bookmarked.  
I don't know if you guys know about the audio programming language called Supercollider but there was this thing #sc140 about 140-character supercollider programs, some of which are pretty amazing if you are interested in that sort of thing.

This is very neat. It reminds me of the "Demo" scene in the 80's and 90's where talented graphics programmers would make amazing demo's in very limited RAM. Thanks for sharing.

Its awesome.   
When I'm drunk and think about outer space  
You are a good person. Inspiring shit.  
This is straight up Robin Hood, OP is a baller.   
I don't see the analogy with Robin Hood.  
They are overcharging the software because people with ALS are desperate enough to pay for it. This guy is taking the software and making it free for anyone.   
Or maybe the R&D for developing this type of software actually does cost money, and the resulting client base is small and therefore the per client costs are large? In this case, OP is donating his time for development.  
Yeah, but he's not stealing the overpriced software and redistributing it; theft is kind of the cornerstone of the Robin Hood analogy. OP isn't committing a crime for the greater good. He's just a really cool guy.  
Now if someone could just do this with general healthcare.  
I have a question. What was your inspiration for making this ?  
Aunt died from MND. There's only so much a software dev can do to help - this is my attempt.  
You are the Peter Parker of software development.  
Thats a just cause. Best of luck and hopefully it works out great!  
This should definitely be marketed hard towards health institutions. Someone with the right contacts could spread this like wildfire, especially in 3rd world countries where existing solutions don't have such a big foothold. EDIT: Have you thought about integrating it with web-cam only options like http://xlabsgaze.com/ ? (I just googled eye tracking with webcam, I have no affiliation to xlabsgaze)  
Health institutions outside of the US.  Any "Medical Device" in the US requires FCC FDA certification, which is a huge pain in the ass and can cost thousands of dollars.  
Does that apply to computer software, though?  There's no possibility of harm to the patient from badly-written software, as there is with most physical medical devices. EDIT: I mean software meant to run on a PC which is not controlling any kind of physical medical device.  Obviously embedded firmware in pacemakers and such should have some serious certification requirements.  
Yes, it probably does.  There are different "classes" of medical devices that software falls into.  It's less paperwork for certain classes, but still needs to be cleared depending on what it claims to do.  (The FDA regulations are really behind the times on this issue.) Getting a CE mark for the EU or other international market certifications are usually less work than FDA filings, if you want to go that route. Also u/YeahIWroteOptiKey should think about patenting this.  IANAL and I HATE software patents with a passion, but it's worth defending yourself if business goes well.  
I am just hoping he did not accidentally infringe on existing patents :x  
I work with creating software that is designated as a Class 2 medical device and everything we do is FDA governed. Our paperwork has to be perfect, or we could be fined heavily. Shit is serious yo.   
Any software in medical devices, regardless of what kind it is, requires design controls for FDA approval in the USA, and that makes development more expensive. From an article on code reviews I wrote recently:  My background is originally from the medical device industry. In the United States, software in medical devices gets a lot of scrutiny from the Food and Drug Administration, and for good reason; it‚Äôs a place for complexity to hide latent bugs. (Can you say ‚ÄúTherac-25‚Äú?) Basically, the presence of software bumps up even the lowest risk (Class I) devices to require design control. No software? No problem ‚Äî with a few exceptions, only Class II and Class III devices require design controls. Software? Aha ‚Äî you need design controls, even if it‚Äôs a Class I device. Requirements, reviews, documentation, plans, verification, validation, blah blah blah.  IDK about software meant to run on a PC by consumers. That seems like it would be exempt from FDA jurisdiction, unless it is considered an integral part of a medical device... but IANAL.  
It depends.  Something like an EMR (digital chart) doesn't require certification, but if you're using the EMR to administer blood, then (in some specific cases) it does. Like a lot of US regulation, it's a complex minefield of exceptions and legalese, with massive penalties if you guess wrong.  
I mean if the PC controls the motorized vehicle the disabled patient is in, poor eye-tracking software that indirectly controls locomotion could certainly kill someone.  
I'm sure there is some organization that would be willing to help with those costs given the potential  
FDA  
Good suggestion, thanks. I'll try it and update the website if it works.  
I have connections at Abbott if you want me to forward to them. They do 70% of their business in emerging markets.  
 Abbott   You never know what things will lead to - that'd be awesome. Thank you.  
Copying OP's description from /r/software for those curious about what this actually does:  OptiKey is an assistive on-screen keyboard which runs on Windows. It is designed to be used with a low cost (around $100) eye-tracking device to bring keyboard control, mouse control and speech to people with motor and speech limitations, such as people living with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) / Motor Neuron Disease (MND). It works out of the box once you have your eye-tracking device installed and allows selections to be made using dwell selection, as well as physical buttons and assistive devices. If you do not have an eye tracking device you can use OptiKey with a mouse. OptiKey was written to challenge the outrageously expensive, unreliable and difficult to use AAC (alternative and augmentative communication) products on the market. It is, therefore, fully open-source and free. Forever. Video: https://youtu.be/HLkyORh7vKk Website: https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/wiki I'd love to hear your feedback. Julius

Yeah if he didn't make a cheesy pun the whole project is worthless.  
Wow! This could be huge. At first glance it looks to have an has enormous potential for disabled people.

What part of this problem took the longest?  
Continually try to get my arse into gear. That took most of the last 3.5 years.  
This is why I drive an automatic.  
My cousin is suffering from ALS, but I doubt he will be able to get access to expensive tech like that. How can he get something like OptiKey?  
https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/wiki/Get-Started Seems like he needs $100 - 150 for a tracker and a fairly reasonably spec'd computer with USB3  
^ exactly. I am available to help if you have any questions; optikeyfeedback@gmail.com  
Have you looked to see if you can secure an optikey domain name? I only ask because feedback@optikey.net or whatever seems like it would be more trustworthy/likely to get actual responses than a gmail.  
I have optikey.org and optikey.co.uk but I've not hooked them up for emails. Gmail works for me for now. Besides, I barely have enough time to work on OptiKey, let alone run it as a proper business with customer service and everything!  
That doesn't sound too bad. Unfortunately we aren't really that close do I don't know how much he cares to use a computer, but I would like to let him know about it.  
I just took a look at this and anybody with a job in IT should be able to set this up for your cousin. (Yes, usually we don't like being asked for help but I think most of us would be excited to be a part of something like this.)  
My dad has ALS. You're a fucking good person. I don't really have anything else to say.  
Get in touch if you have questions; optikeyfeedback@gmail.com  
Thank you!  
Not just ALS, my uncle suffers from MS and he has been specifically looking for something like this...  
I think Jason Becker would love testing this  
I hope he sees it.  
My stepfather died from ALS about twenty three years ago, back then it was a light talker, where spelling out a long sentence took many minutes; and he had to struggle to make himself understood. While we had fun attempting to make his light talker replicate fart noises, he still grew very frustrated. He can't thank you now for what you've done, but I can. Thank you.  
This is incredible. I'm a nurse who primarily takes care of ALS patients, and I am going to create my own cheap machine to bring with me to give my patients a voice. Thank you SO so much.

Is there any way this could run on non-Windows operating systems using mono or something like that?  
Doubt it. WPF is the hard stuff. If it was WinForms it may run.  
It would be a great project to port, I think. Maybe if I can muster the motivation over the next few months, I'll give it a bash.  
Do it - I would be keen to help you port this. It's on my todo list, but I've got a new(ish) baby and full time job!  
A baby, full time job, and you crank this out...for free, just to help others. Wow. Mad respect.   
 I've got a new(ish) baby and full time job  Yet you took the time to write this. I am impressed and even though I will hopefully never use it, also very thankful. And even though it would in no way detract from the effort or the achievement, do you know someone that needs it? Why did you decided to tackle this problem?  
[deleted]  
It is very big project. The Mono team outright refused to do it back in the day and they had ported Silverlight. It was too big of a project to port WPF after having the code for Silverlight - that's how big WPF is.  
Jesus.  
So... from a purely lazy point of view, would it be possible to control my HTPC with this? Eliminating the crappy bluetooth keyboard/controller?  
Embarrassingly relevant to my interests as well.   
Haha. If your HTPC is Windows based then yes in theory, but from a practical point of view you probably wouldn't want to. You need to be positioned correctly in front of a tracker, which needs to be user the screen. It wouldn't pan out.  
I wonder if there is a market for mounting a tracker to a small telescope and having it find the appropriate face then tracking it with a gimbal. Precision gimbals being run by something like a raspberry pi using OpenCV for face tracking is  within the state of the art for hobbyist electronics.  
Then have several of those spread around the house and be able to control you computer with your eyes everywhere   
Thank you for your contribution to humanity.  People like you bring tears to my eyes because your selfless contribution will help many people for years to come.  Bravo.  
Thank you. I just want it to find the people who can benefit from it now.  
I have a lot of respect for you. You have given part of yourself, so that others may benefit. I'll buy you a meal anytime.  
I like lobster and champagne.  
I work for just above minimum wage, so it may be a while for me to save up for your meal.  
Get back to work then.  
Did you do a patent search and make sure your code is in the clear? If they are charging a lot for the commercial code, they are probably taking some steps to protect their position.  
As a career programmer I feel like code patents are a load of crap. I despise them.  
Agreed. We should move to NZ. I think they scrapped them.  
Or europe. There are very few software patents here  
I'm in London so problem solved.  
Russia has no software patents at all and in fact very explicitly forbids them. Also according to the US Supreme Court something is not patentable if "wholly pre-empt the mathematical formula and in practical effect would be a patent on the algorithm itself", nobody cares though and software patents exist there. But Russia is your best bet.  
Question: does making it free and open-source affect patent enforcement issues at all?    
If he wrote the software using things patented by the company that produces the proprietary stuff, then they could sue or have it taken down. However you could potentially argue that the patent was obvious or something if you figured it out yourself, but that takes a lot of money and lawyers. If he wrote the software in a different method, then there's no patent on what he's done.   
I'm not sure I should comment as my reply could be used against me, but so far, so good. I wrote everything myself, from scratch, with zero reference to existing solutions. My investigation into proprietary solutions began and ended at "huh, that's too expensive. i'll make my own". Hi lawyers!  
Kudos for zero references (and thank you for rising the C# flag today in the open source community)   
You might want to have a quick discussion with a lawyer first. Something to consider would be assigning the copyright to an ALS charity (ALS Association?)... this might discourage companies from suing (lots and lots of bad press). Another thought that occurs would be to placing the code into the public domain (you'd lose control over the code... someone could sell a product based on it)... this might make it more difficult for companies to sue (right now they can sue you as the owner... but if it's in the public domain there is no owner). Lastly maybe the Free Software Foundation would be interested in accepting a copyright assignment (they have deep pockets and might be willing to fight a suit). Only a lawyer could tell if any of these options is suitable.  
He can't sell it but if it is free and open source they have no one to sue. Think of it this way - he is releasing it for European users and he can't stop US users from using it as it is free and open source.  
I think both Russia and New Zealand have no software patents at all, and in fact Russia forbids very explicitly. Just provide a wiki in Russian too and say it's for the Russian/Kiwi market only and that people with shitty patent offices should use it at their own risk.  
If OP doesn't intend to sell or patent his work himself, does he have anything to gain from a patent search?  Or might it just turn any present unwitting infringement into knowing and "direct" infringement?  Might be worth briefly consulting a lawyer before initiating a search? OP is apparently English so this would be a matter of UK patent law?  If the use of a registered patent does result in the breach of a registrant's rights and then subsequently a claim, the defendant may be able to avoid paying damages or an account of its profits if it can prove that it unwittingly infringed the patent, and that it had no reasonable grounds for supposing that the patent existed.    it had no reasonable grounds for supposing that the patent existed.   ...I hope you didn't just cause OP a mess of trouble :(  
From what I found by searching around after asking the question, it doesn't look like OP would have anything to worry about even if he was in the US. Apparently, even in cases of obvious infringement, no open source project has been sued by patent trolls or other more ethical software patent holders. Since OP is not from the US, it's even less of a concern. Luckily it doesn't sound like my question caused OP any indigestion.  
Doesn't OpenGazer already exist? What does this do that OpenGazer didn't?  
The tracking of the user's eyes is really the input for OptiKey. I manage the position data and provide speech and keyboard/mouse control (with swipe style selections etc). I will try OpenGazer and see if it is accurate enough - that would be awesome. Thanks.  
OpenGazer lets you use your own consumer-grade webcam as a basic eye-tracker. OptiKey lets users type/speak using just their gaze in combination with a consumer-grade eye-tracker (which can be had for about $100). I guess if OpenGazer was good enough then OptiKey could run on top of it, but they're two very different, if closely related, applications.  
You're probably thinking of Dasher. OpenGazer is just an eye-tracker via a webcam. This looks like it'd work nicer than Dasher. It also includes word prediction/spellchecking, speech synthesis, and works in all Windows applications by default. The overlay is slick as hell and looks extremely intuitive and user friendly.   
Have you considered using gestures instead of dwell? For my original master thesis I was going to use eye gestures coupled with a backtracking to figure out where the user wants to execute a gesture. For you, this would be even simpler since you already track the hit keys, no need to backtrack. You can probably increase the typing speed by having the user execute a gesture on screen. I would suggest by exiting one of the edges of the screen which then acts as enter for the tracked hit keys. You might want to include this document for people who cannot afford the two trackers you suggested: http://www.mkowalik.pl/et/How%20to%20build%20low%20cost%20eyetracking%20glasses.pdf It is very straight forward to build such a tracker. Combined with the ITUGazeTracker this should lead to a decent result. Let me know if you want me to contribute instructions. Great job!  
While everyone was wasting their time throwing ice on their head you acutally did something concrete and usefull for these people. Very nice  
Barely anyone knew what ALS was before people started throwing ice on their head and raising millions for ALS charities. Hardly 'wasting time'.  
I agree. The ice bucket challenge is a good thing but this is better. (Joking. Seriously)  
you rock OP.  
Yup, this is way better.   
Wasn't there an AMA recently where a bunch of ALS researches talked about all the money and awareness that came from the Ice Bucket Challenge thing?   
Oh, that's what it was about? I only saw the funny videos...  
[deleted]  
I know what ALS is because of the ice bucket thing.   
Would be great if this was ported to Linux! I can imagine that alone would open up the ability for developing specific hardware, especially if on ARM. Imagine a small kit that could be attached to a wheelchair. Or even an output device with USB that could send keystrokes/mouse strokes to any device it was plugged in to!  
The source is out there.  
OP, are you typing all your responses on here with OptiKey?

Excellent, these are right down my alley of skills so I'll probably try to help with bugs and new features now! Thanks for making it open source.  One quick question, can I test the program without buying the $100-150 piece of hardware?  
Wondering the same thing! Awesome job OP  
Yes - out of the box it listens to your mouse's cursor position to simulate where you are looking. Try it out.  
Really, goofy comments below, but I wanted to spend a top-level to say thank you for this. It might even effect me ‚Äî¬†getting brain scans tonight.  
Good luck. Hope you're ok.  
Thanks for the love. No tumors or aneurisms, but forward motion is good.  
Good stuff  
Good luck. You'll be ok  
Where can see the source code? EDIT: Found it: https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey  
I think anyone who works three and a half years on something wanting to help other people deserves all the up votes --and more -- we can throw at him.   
Thank you - the visibility would be great. I've written this a few times; I want people with MND/ALS to see this and know they have alternatives  
I'm late to the party.. but here it is anyway. I worked for The Eye Tribe company (one of the recommended trackers) they are pretty awesome and I'm sure that if we ask them for some discount for anyone that is using the code OptiKey we'll get it. Is that right Sune?  
Here is a word cloud of all of the comments in this thread: http://i.imgur.com/giyZbef.png source code | contact developer | faq  
Love it. Might get a poster made to put above my screen at home.  
"Thank good people". I couldn't agree more.  
As someone who lost his mom to ALS seven years ago, thank you so much for putting effort into helping improve the quality of life for those suffering with such a horrible disease.   
Good on you OP. You are making a huge difference for these people!  
Appreciate that, thanks.  
Cool. Makes me wonder why an ALS charity didn't pay you to do this full time.  
I didn't ask them to. Shit.  
You ate awesome, someday I ll motivate myself and be useful too.  
I do eat awesome. I'm trying to shovel chips and chicken into my mouth while replying to you guys at the moment.  
I wonder if the reason most similar software costs upwards of $10K is if they've got to get licensed by the FDA. I've deployed medical software that was licensed/certified by the FDA, but it was more directly related to treatment.   
Possibly, yes. I'm aiming lower with OptiKey.  
Man you're a better man than I'll ever be, is there anything people can do to help you with this project? Donations, software testing?   
That's inaccurate, but nice of you to say. Testing = yes. Please go nuts. Just not tonight - I'm exhausted and can't face a load of crash reports arriving in my inbox when you manage to kill it.  
Get a loada the hero over here! Awesome work.  
Respect. This is awesome. It really moved me. Do you have this copyrighted and a license on it? If not get on this immediately!!!!! (Did you see how many exclamation marks I put there?!) Seriously. I have a wall of copyrights I did for my FOSS software products. My ex is an attorney, and between her and my business, I know a few things. Its not hard, ugooglize it, or call creative commons or the eff ASAP. I am happy to answer any questions and help point you in directions. For shits and giggles someone send this to Jono Bacon. Edit: I did not clarify. Copyright is first come, first serve. Who ever gets there first gets the copyright. There are horror stories of people who didn't protect their software and had it stolen. And you are taking on some ruthless mutha suckas. Ya' best protect ya' [software]!  
It's licensed under GPLv3.  
Excellent

Tell me what she thinks; optikeyfeedback@gmail.com  
That's brilliant OP. Massive respect !  
You should be sure to test this with a common mobile windows environment like a Surface Pro that could be mounted to someone's wheel chair for speech when out and about. I think it's great that you've done this. I was looking on the contribute page, and there's nothing I could do there, but I think you should have a donate button or something. I'm not even an ALS sufferer, but I'd like to donate some money, even if it was just to be put back into testing with other hardware and such. Again, what a great thing to do.  
Thank you. A surface pro should work well, but might be a little too small (and expensive) to be used full time for someone with MND/ALS. I'm not collecting personally, but enough people have asked that I set up this; https://www.justgiving.com/Julius-Sweetland (I know it's for Cancer Research - my wife's dad died of cancer and it was the anniversary yesterday - it might make her happy to see some internet love going his way)  
Done, and thank you again.  
[deleted]  
I agree. It's a long road ahead, but I've made contact with a local neurological hospital and the MNDA here in the UK so let's see how far I can take this.  
This is awesome and very kind of you. You should probably contact SpecialEffect about this. I'm sure they can use this for their StarGaze program. http://www.specialeffect.org.uk/stargaze  
Is anybody working on making the Tobii EyeX work well on Ubuntu (or other popular Linux desktop distributions)? I can see it being useful to make netbooks and other low-cost Linux-based computing devices accessible.  
that's very cool! and not to shit on your parade, but intel is also releasing the software that Hawking uses on github soon https://github.com/01org/acat  
Not at all. It's great, but different. Some of their ideas are brilliant and I hope to have enough time to perhaps integrate some of them and blend the best of both worlds (eye tracking and automated selection)  
You, sir, have truly earned your karma. Do you accept donations?

Awesome software bro! Made with C# too <3  
I guess it have to be verified and certified by some organizations before it could be used. And probably that is why it could take a long time to be on market and this is why the one have to pay tens of thousands.  
Hi! My father had MND, but sadly he passed away 07. If he was alive today he would appreciate this :)  and I appreciate it too :)  Thanks for doing this, you are a good person.   
My cousin got ALS since 2014. He is only 35 and seems his life going to an end soon. He just cannot tolerate his situation. He still believe and desperate to source any cure or medicine. This will help him a lot.  Thank you very much sharing.   
I think the public key crypto one is actually more confusing than just reading the Wikipedia article.  
I agree. Same goes for the Binary Search one, which is propably one of the easiest algorithms to explain in words but is barely comprehensible in the image. I say that as someone, who generally has no trouble understanding IKEA manuals The quick sort one works really well on the other hand IMHO  
The Binary Search illustration straight up made me think "This isn't that useful of a means of teaching algorithms".  
I think it could be if some of them had  multiple pages of instruction... And accompanied by a classroom and teacher.  
First one I checked!  it wasn't clear at all  
[deleted]  
Please don't try to learn AVL trees from these instructions either.  
Yeah I know how to balance AVL trees and these instructions weren‚Äôt even remotely clear   
That's because they are in Swedish.  
AVL tree gives me PTSD.   
Oh good, I'm doing them in school and I thought I was just retarded. I mean I might still be retarded, but at least I'm not the only handicapped person.   
I think for most of these I only understand what the image is conveying because I understand the concepts they're trying to convey already.  If I were trying to learn from these, then I don't think I'd get very far.   The sorting ones might be ok, but something like public key crypto I probably wouldn't even get the iconography for public and private key from the image without knowing that already.  
[deleted]  
It does specify to perform the algorithm again on each side of the divider.  So the recursion is there.  
[deleted]  
Quicksort is still simpler in psuedocode. The basic idea is simple: def quicksort(xs) = {   pivot = choose_random(xs)   quicksort(xs.filter(_<pivot)) ++ xs.filter(_==pivot) ++ quicksort(xs.filter(_>pivot)) }  Now add some screwing around with pointers and swapping to do it in place, and voila.  
Same with merge sort. Not as intuitive as binary search but nearly incomprehensible in the picture.  
It was very confusing. I couldn't tell if there was recursion by the picture. They should have tried breaking it up more or redraw this  
Really I found the huge arrows to be distracting, I think the traditional gif of all the algorithms visualized is much better.  
I think the quicksort one is the only one that seems to make more sense than just explaining the algorithm. But they're all kind of cute. I like the bogo one, even though it's literally just "keep making random guesses until you're right."  
I don't think it's actually meant to explain the concept to someone completely new to it without any additional text whatsoever. The website even mentions that "they were originally created for S√°ndor's algorithms and datastructures lecture at TU Braunschweig". Having said that, I think the public key one becomes clear if you "read" the images carefully, the way you might want to read a visual novel:  There's a safe that's only open in the "up" position. It has two keys, one of which can only turn left (public), the other only right (private). Bob sends copies of the turn-left key to the world. A friend wants to send a secret love letter to bob. He puts in into the safe and locks the door with the turn-left key. Only Bob has the turn-right key to open the safe and read the letter. Bob wants to sign a letter. He puts it into the safe and locks it with his turn-right key. Everyone can check that it was Bob who has locked the safe, because their turn-left keys unlock the safe. A pirate tries to forge a message from Bob. He doesn't have Bob's turn-right key, so he puts it into a different safe and locks it with his own turn-right key. But then the other people know that this message isn't from Bob, because their turn-left keys don't open the safe.   
Agreed. I understand Public Key Cryptography so the "key" for me to understand how it's explained in the image was that there's a clockwise key and a counter-clockwise key.  
Ooohhh, now I get it.  
It makes so much sense now, thanks!  
 "they were originally created for S√°ndor's algorithms and datastructures lecture at TU Braunschweig"  That's cool, I took that lecture a few years ago. At the time he didn't have these images yet, but it's totally something he would use. He also had a bunch of XKCD comics in his slides, whenever he found one relevant to the topic. Great guy.   
Absolutely. Took this lecture just last semester, dude also likes to rap about Euler paths and uses students to demonstrate avl tree restructures. Clearly the best course I took (as of now)  
Can we just appreciate the sleazy dude representation of the malicious agent, though?  
I always found it easiest to explain saying that the public key is a box of open padlocks out on the porch that anybody can take; and the private key is the single key that can open those padlocks once they've been locked. So anybody can put something important in a box and lock with one of the padlocks. From then on, nobody except the owner of the private key can open the box again, so it's safe to send to the recipient in the mail.  
Now use the analogy to explain signing something with your private key ;-)  
How about this: You have a second set of padlocks, but you keep them all to yourself. And you make a box full of the key that fits those padlocks. Then you send those keys to people such as your bank.  When you want to send an important document to your bank, you write it, take a picture of the document, and put the picture in a small box. You lock the box with one of the special padlocks. Then you put the original document and the small box in a big one. You lock it with one of the padlocks that the bank gives out to everyone. When the big box arrives, the bank unlocks it and sees your document and the small box. They use the key they got from you to unlock the small box and compare the real document with the picture inside. If the picture looks the same as the real document they know it must have been from you.  
Key signing is already an analogy. The whole cryptography process is an implementation detail, which is why explaining it is always messy.   
So an pretty close to IKEA instructions manuals.  
[deleted]  
Care to do a short ELI-6th grader?  
Absolutely!   So the fundamental problem that we‚Äôre trying to solve is this; How can Alice and Bob talk to each other privately, over a medium where everyone else can hear what is being said and when they have never established secret keys beforehand. A common scenario might be when you are in a crowded room and want to get something private to your friend across the room without others understanding what you said. Turns out there is a very neat way to solve this that‚Äôs called Diffie-Hellmann key exchange.  Everyone knows two numbers g and p. P is a very large prime number (~800 decimal digits) and g is a number smaller than P but with some special properties in relation to P.  Before the exchange begins, Alice picks some random x such that 0 < x < P and Bob picks some random y such that 0 < y < P Now the actual exchange:  Alice  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîg^x ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî> Bob  Alice  <‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîg^y‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  Bob  Now Alice has gy and x. So she computes (gy )x Bob has gx and y. So he computes (gx )y  So the both get:    (g^y)^x = g^xy = g^yx = (g^x)^y  Now both have a shared secret: gxy ! And the eavesdropper Eve only heard g, gx, gy (and she knows P).  If the numbers g, p, x and y are defined correctly, Then Eve won‚Äôt be able to compute log_g gx = x. This is called the discrete log.  All of the aforementioned operations are in the group Z_p* , which just means that after each operation we apply the function mod P to the result. This is what makes the function extremely inefficient to reverse: the issue is that taking the discrete log hard in Z_p.  So an eavesdropper hasn‚Äôt been able to figure out anything, since Alice and bob agreed on a secret code. They can use this code as the key to other normal encryption algorithms to send messages to each other with end to end encryption: meaning nobody can read any messages.   
Is there an easy way to explain why the eavesdropper cannot work back from g, gx to calculate x? Using small numbers it's obviously trivial.  Is the calculation with big numbers just too time consuming even if you have all the other inputs?  And if so, is there a straightforward way to explain why?  Some kind of gross inefficiency in the algorithm to calculate log_g gx or something.  
I've got a question, then. How does Diffie-Hellman allow for the behavior we see in this when Diffie-Hellman is about forming a mutual secret key? Isn't the point of Diffie-Hellman to enable secure symmetrical cryptography?  
Well, are they meant to be easier? Seems more like a novelty to me  
They are meant to be used in a lecture, see the footnote.   
Especially as there is the tried and true way of conveying with color merging. like this example I keep looking at the Idea version and its still confusing exactly what they are trying to convey, when I know the end product and concept  
Except this isn't trying to explain the inner workings of Diffie-Hellman. It's trying to explain two uses of public key cryptography:  Letting anyone send you messages that only you can decrypt. Sending messages that people can verify are from you because only your public key can decrypt them.   
It's almost as if language was invented to make it easier to communicate our ideas  
A picture is worth a thousand of your "words", checkmate.

For sorting this explanation is much clearer.  
My professor taught us different sorting algorithms by picking students with diferentes heights, putting us in front of the classroom, shuffling us and sorting us (I was the shortest one).   
A: That was bloody mesmerising. B: Next cargo-cult coding idea: Coding by way of interpretive dance. I envisage it working like those arcade dance machines, but with over-engineering and smugness! EDIT: B.1: Once folk have grown tired of talking about their interpretive dance lang, I'll shake things up with an Emacs edition, Vi edition, and Dvorak edition. Any seed accelerators out there... You run with it, I'm far too lazy.  
[deleted]  
The Hungarian dancers have a whole series of these sorting algorithms. Their Quicksort is fun too.  
So then, it is exactly like the Ikea instruction manuals?  
Yeah most of these make very little sense to me and I know how the algorithms work.  
 I think the public key crypto one is actually more confusing than just reading the Wikipedia article.  That's truly saying something!  
Thus the similarity to a IKEA instructions.  
A person that never heard of how quick sort works, would never know how a system knows when the array is sorted. All the image shows is the you select a random element and order it. Supposedly you repeat this until...?  
Merge sort:  Split values Order the values on each side Do some magic Everything is sorted yay!    
Would you order each side using Quick Sort or do a bunch of Merge Sorts until each group of values has 2 values?  
Keep merge sorting until you have two values in each group. It's a recursive algorithm.  
Merge sort can be implemented iteratively  
All recursive algorithms can be implemented iteratively.  
Yeah, but I figured they were asking about the way it's implemented in the image.  
Merge sort splits all the data into essentially groups of two, then orders them by building the groups together. So if you had 7 2 9 4, it would split it into (7) (2) (9) (4), then put the first two together in order, then the next two. So (2 7) (4 9). Then it puts these two together adding a single element from the beginning of whichever dataset has a lower first value. If sorting least to greatest, you'd add 2, then 4, then 7, then 9. And then you'd end with (2 4 7 9) Edit: for a little bit more info, this sort is a decently "fast" sort because the data is only really checked once. Mergesorts runtime is said to be O(n log(n) ), which essentially means that the algorithm runs in a time that is dependent on n, which is the size of the input. If you were to graph input size on an x axis, and runtime on the y axis, and then run a mergesort many times on varying dataset sizes, your runtime graph would look approximately like the graph y=x*log(x).   
Merge sort sees each item more than once, otherwise it would have been linear O(n). The logn part comes from the recursion of splits: you split the array in half in each step, so you will have logn levels of splitting. If you think of it as a tree, the tree will have height of logn.  
Yeah I think one of the most complicated concepts about algorithms is recursion and these diagrams just boil it down to " ok now do the sort again and voila it's all sorted"  
/r/restofthefuckingowl  
This is cool but I don't understand ikea directions or algorithms so this is pretty much the worse of both worlds for me.   
Wait until you look at the tools they give you.  
[deleted]  
you basically described most enterprise business programs!  
[deleted]  
Yeah, to be an enterprise business programmer, you just need to be on call 24/7  
Yes, you can. And if you'll accept a PR gracefully you'll be ahead of most.  
Actually, in enterprise business, you attach to many classes, for when your chair needs to become a table, but turns out it isn't that good at being a table in the end.  
Day 1: Business tells us they need a chair. Day 5: We've figured out what kind of chair we think they want. We show it to the business and they say it's great. Day 6: We begin development on the chair. Day 14: We're 2/3 of the way done with the chair, and the business has asked if we could make it a recliner, with electric reclining. We push back and settle on making a manual recliner. 90% of the code we've written so far gets deleted. Day 32: We've just demoed the recliner to the business. They think it's a great recliner, but they want to pilot it to a small group of users first. Day 36: The business has decided that they want to go in a different direction, and they need a table instead. And that is Agile development. /s  
And if you‚Äôre contractors, the whole chair team gets let go while a whole new table team is being brought it. They will eventually be asked to build a recliner.  
Hey, one of my professors who workedgir IBM mentioned something I found kind of interesting. He said if you can do class design well you will be much more highly sought than if you have great low-level coding skills.  He told us this great story about how his team would work ona challenging project, and for a week or two there was a board to stick post it notes for hypothetical classes for the project, and at the end of the week they collectedall the ideas and began the design stage, thought that was pretty cool. Anyways, I was just going to see what you thought about that anecdote, I am trying to use the CRC card method when I begin my projects, and it honestly makes class design much simpler for myself., was interested inhow much the industry really does value that ability.  
In my experience. System and class architecture is almost always best left to a skilled dictator.  
This little catch block isn't important is it?  I can't find where it goes. 3 months later the entire construction collapses  
And a month and a half after that someone tells you that everyone's been living in the rubble for six weeks but didn't really think it was worth bringing up until starvation was imminent and everyone involved was just that much more angry and insane.  
ahh in the case of javascript, when the catch block is empty, it's just swallowed into nothingness. At least put a little console message stating where shit went wrong.  
Good concept, poor execution   
I think this is meant to be a commentary on IKEA manuals.  
I really hope it isn't. Because IKEA manuals are generally readable and people end up with a finished thing. They might not be executed super well but they get the point across. Meanwhile these images don't get anything across. People that already have full understanding of the concepts might be able to "recognize" what it is about, but these images are definitely not going to teach how binary search or public key encryption is implemented to a newbie.. not by any stretch of the imagination. They hardly even get the concepts across. But to be honest, remove the "binary search" header from the image and I wont even be able to recognize what it is about at all. I really don't get what the people behind this website were trying to achieve.     
But IKEA manuals are fantastic. They get the instructions past language barriers without requiring printing translations.  
I've never found IKEA manuals hard to understand. There's this whole meme about IKEA furniture being low quality and difficult to assemble, but I've never found it to have any basis in reality.  
Agreed. I don't find many of these particularly useful and I already understand most of the algorithms they're trying to explain.  
If they drew Dijkstra‚Äôs shortest path algorithm, they wouldn't even have to come up with a fake Ikea name for it. :)  
Dijkstra is a popular Dutch last name, not really scandinavish. I'd say D√Æjkstr√£ is more Ikea-ish.  
We have neither √£ or √Æ in Scandinavia, and I can't think of a single Swedish word containing "ijk", so I can't say I agree.   
As a Swede the √•, √§ and √∂ everywhere is really annoying.  
But bin√§ry is the correct spelling, √§nd you know it.  
I know right? Putting √§,√• and √∂'s everywhere doesnt make it swedish people!  
I'm not even Swedish, but my language also has accents, and it's driving me nuts too. Everything seems to be in English but with all these idiotic accents everywhere.  
[deleted]  
That's because there's no √º in Swedish.  
I have to poop... Help me  
I'm not a Swedish, heck my native lang doesn't even have accented words at all, but I know how ridiculous these pictures are.   
As a slide in a lecture they look great.. not so good for self learning....  
I understand IKEA instructions and i have a decent understanding of all of these algorithms. But most of these illustrations are very confusing. Even if they're meant for lectures and people who already know some stuff about it, i don't think they're very helpful. Cool idea though. But i guess a lot of a bit more complex algorithms can't really be explained in a decent way without using some words.  
This is cool, but not good.  
Seems hungarians have a thing to make cool algorithms visualisations. Remember those folk dances videos? https://youtu.be/ywWBy6J5gz8  
Hungarians think in numbers, I grew up there. Not much practical talent, rather scientific.  
To be honest those illustrations make sense only if you're already familiar with the algorithms they depict. In no way can they be deemed "explanatory".  
This helped me understand nothing.  
This was worthless.  
Hey, my professor made these! Very surprising to see :)  
Idea is amazing. I love it. Some algorithms hard to understand but generally it is very instructive  
500 internal server error at the moment   
Anybody got some screenshots?  
In the ONE STROKE DRAW manual, the crossed out graphs (which are implied to not have Eulerian paths), both have Eulerian paths.   
That's what I thought at first too, but on second look I think the crossed out "graphs" is actually a single graph. They're saying you can't apply this algorithm to a graph which is completely divided into multiple parts.  
Honestly, those are pretty confusing, even for the concepts I understand.   
Just to piggy back on this, does anyone know of any good books or resources for a gentle total beginner intro to algorithms?  
I wanna see the Middle Out algorithm too  
Aaand it‚Äôs dead  
Aww. Reddit's hug of death has come.  
seems alright if you already know the algorithms...  
The good ole reddit hug of death  
am I gonna have 3 lines of code left over at the end, unsure of where they go?  
Not a programmer but I can't help but feel like they missed the mark on these unless the idea was so still be confusing   
Can this be learned by one person or is it recommended to have 2+ people  
Imagine getting a recursive IKEA manual. Ok so to build this cabenet first build a smaller cabenet in the same manner as the cabinet you are currently assembling...  
1/10 No Allen key.  
Cute but they are really difficult to understand imho.  
Yea these make sense if you already know the algorithms...  
None of these drawings make any sense! I understand giving an upvote for the novelty of the idea, but how is this getting > 17k votes? I don't think I've ever seen any post on this sub get this many points or even close.  
[deleted]  
It is not.   
My Algorithms and Data Structures prof runs this site. He is actual german, but replacing vowels with umlauts makes the words look swedish, soooo...  
This is pretty cool   
I love the diacritic symbols randomly thrown in everywhere. Makes me read the words with the voice of the Swedish Chef.  
[deleted]  
Yeah, I know they don't make any sense (I'm somewhat able to read Swedish). But they're fun. :-)  
So I still don't know how to make one myself?  
Public key crypto left me with more questions  
that‚Äôs so cool  
A great book that we use in my computer science department is Robert Sedgewicks Algorithms 4th edition. It has pictures and extremely simple English. I personally love it and it has helped me self learn through my begging courses. If you're interested in this type of stuff i highly recommend it.  
So you mean they leave half the instructions out and what they do put in them is extremely confusing? Sounds great.  I enjoyed spending 7 hours on a 'simple' ikea deal because the instructions were so obfuscated. Just what we need, more tech illiteracy.  
Because words were the thing standing in the way of understanding sorting algorithms.  
The only thing more complicated than an algorithm are IKEA instructions   
I think we hugged this site to death  
500 Internal Server Error nginx/1.12.2 !!!  
Nice website.. thanks üëç  
The best part about this is how simple design convinces your brain that "idea" is pronounced like "ikea" instead of the way you've said it your entire life.  
Um... I already pronounce Ikea like Idea. In the US. Apparently we've Americanized it. How do you say it? I'm guessing you are in another country!  
This is good and all but what do you do with the leftover screws?  
A little while ago I found a site that was like one of the coding courses where you built an algorithm to solve a problem based a concept like recursiveness... it was a great resource for helping me learn some of them, but I can‚Äôt find it any more.  I wish I could!  I never finished it.  
These are more confusing than code. Bad analogies are what you give to non-technical people.  
Nice  
Error 500. We kilt it.  
Please nobody trying to learn about comp sci use these. They're more confusing than actually reading about the algorithm in their entirety.  
Cool  
I've got a nice algorithm that shuffles a deck of cards, then deals a "hand" of as many as desired.  As simple as it sounds, code to do this is relatively complex.  A graphic of the process would be an interesting addition to their website.  
these diagrams are not very well-done.. they're confusing without enough textual analysis.  
Thank god for this. I'm in a grade 12 online programing course and my teacher is awful at trying to explain algorithms.   
Upcoming algorithm exam, this is golden. Thanks OP.  
I'm  not sure which one would be harder, the algorithms or IKEA instructions...  
I read the title as a site that explains the algos to assemble IKEA kits.  
I need this thank you üòä  
Kinda cool.. thanks.  
I finally understood how sorting algorithms work.   
Help, I made a typo and now my house is full of hex wrenches.  
I could see this going places.  
Great idea. OAuth flows would be a great addition to this.  
Graph scan reminded me, is there an algorithm to search for irregularly distanced or overlapping nodes? In MUD / text adventure Mapping, given nodes (rooms) of an arbitrary position and connections that would be cardinal and ordinal (n, ne, e, se, s, sw, w, nw)[and arbitrary directions, like "Go window"] directions, apart from description changes, the only way to detect when a user has transitioned to a new area would be when different rooms overlap (Start in room 1, go south to room 2, go west to room 3, go northeast to room 4 [indicating that the path between 1 and 2, or 2 and 3 should be an area transition in the map]), or that it takes fewer rooms to reach a more distant path (It would take 30 rooms to cross <city> proper, but up on the city walls, it only takes 8).  
‚ÄúCool‚Äù  
Nice!  
Kwik sort is a good one.   
Thanks  
Yeah, some of those could use more instruction.  
I totally don't understand how this has gotten so much upvoting.  
The illustrations are nice, but I find it useful only if I knew how it worked before.  
this implementation, if it works, translates to money for GTA:O. I was so offput by online load times (and getting randomly kicked all the time) on my computer that I lost interest and played Watchdogs online instead  
[deleted]  
I loved the game. Stopped playing because of the long load time and the heist/lobby system.  My typical experience is: load game, alt tab and do something else while it loads over 5 minutes (m.2 EVO drive 9700k, $4K PC tower btw) 1 The get into free play.  2 Look for PUG heists.  3 Accept one.  4 Go into loading screen for heist 5 Heist is full! (Why did you boot me from my free play then R*) 6 Load BACK into free play for 2 minutes 7 Repeat steps 1-6 until I win the lobby lottery and actually get a place. This can take 30 minutes and is too disruptive to actually enjoy free play.  8 hope the host isn‚Äôt AFK 9 hope you don‚Äôt get arbitrarily kicked 10 actually play the mission maybe  11 fail once, someone leaves, back to free play. 12 repeat steps 1-12 I realised once I‚Äôd been playing for 6 hours with the goal of playing a heist and hadn‚Äôt actually finished a single mission despite doing nothing but queue all day. That‚Äôs when I stopped playing.  All these issues could be resolved with some common sense updates to their NetCode so you only get pulled into a session when there‚Äôs space. And perhaps you can backfill heist roles so one persons dc doesn‚Äôt ruin 3 peoples day.  But this article proves R* truly doesn‚Äôt care about the user experience. Hell if they made the game easier to play people might not resort to micro transactions. I‚Äôd like to attribute it to incompetence over malice but either way they don‚Äôt deserve my time or my money. Which is heartbreaking as I love the series and it‚Äôs been ruined for no reason.  
I feel your pain man GTA 5, is no doubt a classic single player experience, but online lost my interest when I realized how much time was spent NOT DOING FUN THINGS  
This article was really insightful! I've always wondered what was going on in the code while waiting eons for GTAO to load. This is super embarrassing for Rockstar. This has been a well-known issue since GTAO was released, and it turns out to be something so simple.   I wonder how many millions of dollars Rockstar has missed out on from users being frustrated with long load times and closing the game. Meanwhile, some random guy with no access to the source code was able to solve this problem with about 100 lines of code  
You raise a good point on how much money they may have missed out on. I loved GTAO when it first launched; played all of the time, but the load times became cumbersome, especially when I lead a somewhat busy life. I used to buy those shark cards etc when I used to play. I stopped playing entirely and have not played for a long time now.  
Loading and matchmaking was 100% why me and my friends all stopped playing.  
[deleted]  
I just tuned the game on last week for the first time in years, only got an hour out of it before i remembered why I stopped.  its really too bad  
Same. I started online and did all the missions but never bothered playing again or doing the campaign because of load times.  
It just shows how little they care.  
Reminds me of that time modders started inlining setters/getters by hand in compiled, closed-source code, getting like a 30% boost in framerate at the time, all because Bethesda forgot to turn on optimizations when compiling Skyrim.  
I personally believe it's not because they forgot. I reckon it was because their development practices were so flawed that turning on optimization introduced even more showstopper bugs. I bet they had a ton of undefined behaviour time bombs hiding all throughout their code base.  
Maybe they QAed the release build on the wrong settings and did not want to take the risk when releasing it.  
[deleted]  
This is totally plausible.  
I low key hate how Bethesda is allowed to release buggy as shit games and people go "oh its just Bethesda" That half-ass it mentality is probably a key factor in why we get so many not quite finished games now. Why do the final 5% of work that's the most difficult when you can just get the community to do it for you for free  
I'm totally guilty of this, I love open world games and have played them since they've existed and I have a tolerant attitude of "helping the game along" in regards to bugs and scripts breaking etc, I often deal with bugs unconsciously without even thinking about it and it doesn't even really register in my brain unless initial steps such as reloading and such fail to work.  
There's a reason only 1-2 companies are making big open-world games like Skyrim, it's a lot of work and there are a lot of bugs you are just going to run into. People like to eat the Unofficial patches asses but those are done by a handful of developers over years of development time.  
Which is weird, because I'm sure they've lost millions of dollars due to this bug. You'd think they'd care a lot about it  
I am positive they think their success is tied to pumping out new content for micro-transactions  
New content which increases the size of that JSON payload.  Further increasing load times.  
within 24 hours of release they made over 800 million dollars, its been years since then. They've made billions in people buying it on second platforms and online transactions.  
Yup, and GTA5 is 8 years old.  
[deleted]  
I know exactly how this type of thing happens.  "We want to spend 1 hour on reducing the load times..." "No, we have no time. We need to get the new DLC out. Our customers already expect long load times this isn't a critical issue".  
GTAV budget (around release): $265M GTAV sales: broke 6 world game sale records on console release. $800M first day.  everything after that is just gravy for them. A couple of M up/down doesn't really matter.

If it only kept players around long enough for them to spent an extra 100k total, that's still a sizable fraction of keeping a dev around for a year. Given how easily a random person on the internet without proper source or tool access could narrow down the cause, and employee spending an entire month to fix that one constant annoyance to players driving them to other games would more than pay for itself. Better yet, budget a dev for 6 months of optimizing the player experience so that it's as easy as possible for them to impulsively launch and play, rather than second-guess whether they want to sit through the whole loading screen, and ultimately settle for something else.  
Maybe they are doing it on purpose for "advertising" all their "promotions" in-game?  
Quite the opposite. They're rolling in money from a damn near ancient game. Why would they bother fixing issues if people clearly don't give a shit?  
As a long as it meets the acceptance critieria... It's weird we expect more passion out of underpaid game developers than some guy working on some pointless tool like 1000 people use once in a blue moon (like me).  
I don't think people even realize publishers exist, they just assume everything works like a small self published studio.  
It's not that they don't care. Let me explain how it works inside a company. A company has a goal, and every action must build towards that goal, and that goal alone. You work at a non-profit to help the homeless. Well good luck trying to justify an electronic payroll system that isn't from the 70s. You have to prove that it would reduce costs and is the only way the company can grow (with the limitation that donations and government aid have) to serve more homeless. You can't? Well tough titties it ain't happening this quarter then. In any for-profit it has to basically justify how it'll make them more money. You want to do right by the costumer and handle their #1 complain? Prove that it would make the costumers throw more money at it (hard to prove) and/or that it would get you more customers (but be aware the #1 complaint of costumers, who pay, may not be the #1 reason other people don't buy the game). You can't make a solid argument? Tough titties. So in any software company, you have to justify why you invest in what you invest. And it has to be proven to that. You want to lower loading screens because they take too long? Well you have to prove that it's the #1 customer complain, and then prove how much money is potentially lost by frustrated players leaving, or not even trying online once because they won't go over the loading screens. Who knows if the people who can make this argument have access to the data to make the argument though, that's just the realities of large companies. Once you have a justification for why this is worth it, you can use it to justify if there's a cost-effective way to do it. So then you get the data, show that it's a problem with a solution, and propose an answer. At this point most software engineers would have already spent ~20% of their time for a month or more on this. That's a huge hit on their performance, and it could put their job on the line if it doesn't pay off. If it turns out people aren't that interested, or that there's no easy way to do a large enough improvement (that is you could shave some seconds and still have it in the order of minutes which is just as bad) then you lost. So it's hard for people to prioritize this. Some companies do a lot of work to try to avoid falling in that scenario. That they can have engineers exploring and solving general problems that may not be obvious, but add up to the total money the game makes. Rockstar doesn't seem to have it, you could tell even before this argument.  
I would think a shorter load time would save a fair  amount of money in QA.  On the other hand, having it go too fast can reduce the anticipation, and that can make players not as engaged. I'd think 2 minutes would be more than plenty for that though.  
I assume many engineers tried to fix it over the years and one or more managers/executives stopped them.  Due to ignorance, stupidity and/or lack of consideration for users.  
Suit: What are you working on? Dev: I'm fixing a problem where levels take way too long to load, leaving the player in a loading screen for a long time. Suit: What is the business value of that? Dev: Well, it's a better experience for the player if they aren't stuck in a loading screen, and increases the quality of our product. Suit: But what is the business value in that? Dev: People don't like to wait in loading screens. Long loading screens will make people think poorly of our game, and some will probably quit altogether. Suit: I'll schedule a meeting to assign this to a business analyst for research so we can define measurables for this feature. Dev: That's really not necessary, it'll just take me a couple more hours- Suit: Do me a favor and write a business-case report on this, then add these five new microtransactions to the game.  
This made me think, why do we assume things that are important are measurable? Things like love are important but hard to measure - sure companies don't care about love, they care about money, which can be measured, but that doesn't mean that everything that leads to more money can be measured? How stupid do you have to be not to realise that? I think we as developers in general have an ethical responsibility towards our companies to call out the stupidity of managers who are running the company into the ground.

Metoo on this. It was just insane waiting for this game to load on very good hardware. Not even talking about how missions and stuff lobbies work in assholish ways like for example if one player quits mission stops. If gtav crashes mission stops. Can't join a friend in a mission. It's basically year 2001 in there.  
[deleted]  
You forgot the part where someone crashes out and has to redo that entire initial load and joining right right server. 3 times over the entire night, minimum.  Play for 4 hours, only ACTUALLY play for 2.5.  
As web dev, we literally get torn to hell if the site loads too long.  I'd be surprised if Rockstar, being as massive as they are, didn't take it into account. Maybe they realize that those who stayed are more willing to suffer and spend more money?  
 I'd be surprised if Rockstar, being as massive as they are, didn't take it into account.  What makes you think that being a bigger company means they pay more attention to detail?  
The problem with webdev is another one: Dev: We managed to get the load times below .5 seconds! Management: Great! Now please add these ad and tracking scripts. Loading times are now 3 seconds.  
I tried to refund the game on steam due to loading times. Got told no because I had more than 2 hours of play time. Well, most of it was load time motherfuckers!  
I'm a massive GTA head, or was at least. Really invested in the community from 2001 onwards, but played from the 2D original on release. GTAV put me off the game entirely for a heap of reasons, but the straw that broke the camel's back (for BF1, as well) was the load times. Catch a grip, Rockstar. Great blog post/article.  
For the first six months of covid, the Instacart site had no debounce when searching for products. It was excruciating. Placing an order took about 3-4x longer than it should have. I wonder how many customers they gained due to the pandemic, only to lose to inept development.  
I respect him just for giving that much of a shit  
Feel bad tho. "Please fix"? After 7 years rockstar dont care. There is bug in the game that stops new missions after 52% completion and rockstars official solution is start the story mode over again.  
I have a video on YouTube demonstrating a bug in GTA Online that makes it impossible to complete the Agent ULP mission. It's now March 2021 which means that I uploaded that video two-and-a-half over three years ago. I still get comments on it to this day of people saying that the bug still persists.  Edit: I checked the date on that video. The upload date was Dec 15, 2017 which means it's actually over three years old, yet the bug still persists.  
I still can't have the tenth prop for Solomon. I know it's the movie reel. But it's simply not there for me. I contacted the support and not even they can do shit about it. Its like all people handling this project suddenly died and now it's handled by just one guy. And its the guy that used to deliver the coffee.  
He really put his finger on the gaping hole here  
Hashtable with O(n) insert time? Now I've seen everything...  
Does that means that you've already seen an O(n2) parsing before?  
All the time. You'd be surprised how common that shit is in bespoke C++ parsers.  
Loops of strlen are actually a very common problem, with either parsing or concatenating strings in loops. It's very easy to fix the problem typically, and there's no way a published json parser would have this bug without people complaining about performance for files with more than 100 lines, they must have coded it themselves.  
 Hashtable NotAHashTable  FTFY  
Considering the mammoth amount of hard programming problems that were solved to make this game I'm really shocked that something this easy to fix made it through.  
I'm not surprised that it made it through at all. A function accidentally did way slower processing than the developer thought it did and that's just things that happen. Not fixing it on the other hand...  
‚ÄúHey can we devote a sprint to looking into the loading times, they seem to be pretty bad‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat? No absolutely not. We need to ship more content‚Äù  
God damn it I can totally imagine managers saying that shit. IDK how many suggestions I've made to improve a process or rework some code that would take AT MOST a few days that could pay off huge (like weeks saved easily) that got ignored due to not having the time or budget. Basic shit like can we get a debugger setup for this project? would be met with NO FEATURES ARE MORE IMPORTANT AND WE HAVE NO TIME FOR TOOLS!!. But then debugging manually takes significantly longer (I'm talking freaking prints...) so more time ends up being wasted than if we just got a debugger setup in the first place. R* easily let millions of hours be wasted by players, probably missed out on millions in additional revenue from players who stopped playing because load times increased beyond what they felt like was worth it, and all for maybe a few grand worth of developer wages.  
 God damn it I can totally imagine managers saying that shit.  I worked for one of them. Imbecile. Multiple clients passed on the product specifically because it was slow, and we knew the fix and it wasn't that expensive but he absolutely would not allow it over features people weren't using because the slow load/start times. Glad I left that behind, that project caused a cascade of dozens of engineers to transfer over to other areas, it's been six years and it still has almost no adoption because it's still slow as shit.  
Man I feel your pain. Was in the same situation a few years ago. What we started doing was rewording every issue to just let it sound like it is a feature. Like "slow load times on page X" -> "extend page X". Worked great for a long time. Managers thought we were only working on features the whole time and the project has no bugs. After a few months the sales team started complaining. The management responded by introducing "sellable features". If it is not a visual change that the user can see it is not a "sellable feature". Marketing had to be able to create some material around it to count. Which then again lead to the devs just doing the smallest stupid UI changes with every issue to make it "sellable". Like moving a button a few pixels or slightly changing the colours. Eventually the sales lead and manager left the company. Things are much better now.  
"How doe fixing a problem get us more money?"  
I work in software engineering so I can completely understand how this came to pass. However, I can also understand an "outsider's" perspective. What people need to consider when scrutinizing a company's software product is scale, as in the sheer number of people working on it. The engineer who wrote the code for parsing the JSON could have been new to the gig and is far removed from the other engineers that actually use it. Since the code works, there's likely no communication between the author and the users. Consequently, the users just assumed that the long loading times would be expected given that parsing a JSON file is far from the only thing the loading process actually does. The problem from the product consumer perspective is that the load times did not make the cut when determining what the priorities are. As a result, no one at Rockstar has bothered looking into why it takes so long.  
Considering this is a programming subreddit it's likely most of us work in software engineering  
Maybe, but this isn‚Äôt a private community where we need to provide proof of qualifications. Anyone is free to browse and comment this subreddit, programmer/engineer or not. Hell, even skilled people can fail to grasp the business and social aspects for software development.  
That JSON was probably also quite small when they tested it, and grew massively over time. Since nobody plays their own games there apparently they never figured it out. Or any of the other explanations mentioned here.  
When I say made it through, I'm talking about the length of time it's out there. The fact they shipped it this way isn't a big deal. Even though, honestly, had I been on the project I'd be pretty bothered to ship it where there it is that much slower. That should have raised some red flags.  
Yeah something like this could easily slip through in a large company, especially if it‚Äôs buried in some internal library that is not maintained. But yeah it seems like nobody at rockstar was ever curious enough to profile this loading sequence.  
That  ‚Äòhash‚Äô code was painfully dumb though  
At one point this probably worked fine. This issue is processing time increases exponentially. So there are 63 thousand items now. With half that ~32k you reduce load times by 75% from 6 min to 1.5. Half again to ~16k and load times are down 87.5% to 45sec. This was probably initially tested with dozens or hundreds of items. Even low thousands and it would have completed almost instantly. But whoever did the design should have known the impact of this design and done it the right way initially even if it took a little more development time.  
I actually don't find the fact that it was overlooked to be a big deal. You can't get everything right up front and you don't want to go prematurely optimizing things. The fact that it existed for 7 or 8 years as a pretty huge time suck is what is hard to imagine.  
Yep, that's the real issue here.  This performance issue was bad enough to show up clearly in some rando's profiling attempt despite their complete lack of any debugging info.  Given that profiling is the first step in figuring out why your code is slow, it's obvious that the only reason Rockstar didn't find this is because they never bothered to look. It basically highlights what the real reason for the long start times are: over the past 7-8 years, Rockstar has literally never once bothered to check what they were.  
I wouldn't believe it if it wasn't for the impressive article. The biggest game on the planet, probably the best game devs in the industry, 7 years after release, by far the most common complaint about the game. And they didn't even do a cursory profile to find such a silly bug? How is that even remotely possible? Finding and fixing something like this would be trivial with access to the code, even for someone fresh out of university. I was under the assumption that the loading time was done for political/marketing reasons ("look at our logos"), anti-cheat or something out of the ordinary. But json parsing? I still find it hard to believe this was just not caught.  
Both of the problems identified by the article author were dramatically worse with data size. Quite likely, during early testing the game did not have a noticeable problem calling sscanf and searching hashes because the data size was small, but over time as the release date approached, the JSON ballooned to 10MB and nobody had a handle on the load-time problem. Then they chose to "solve" it with loading screens instead of assigning developers to identify and fix the issue, because of all the normal reasons: leadership made a bad decision, or the people who wrote the original code had left the company, or they felt there wasn't time to diagnose the issue properly, maybe they had other issues that crashed the game and only just managed to solve those before release so this one wasn't top priority. Not saying it's right, but all of these are common.  
//TODO optimize this before the JSON gets too big   
Hey, where'd you get my code comments?  
oh shit, is this not best practice?  
// 2012-02-24: temporary fix  
//proof of concept, optimize when some time is budgeted to prevent technical debt  
But as this article proves, this is a crazy simple problem to diagnose and fix.  If 1 guy without source access could do it, any competent engineer on their team should've been able to do it.  The fact that this wasn't found shows that over the course of 7 years, not a single person has even attempted to profile and fix this issue.  
It's entirely possible the developers are working a demoralizing job and have no real motivation to do anything that's not on a ticket. And if the leadership saw more value in microtransactions than fixing loading time, it will never get a ticket. That's my guess.  
 You see Bob, it's not that I'm lazy, it's that I just don't care. It's a problem of motivation, all right? Now if I work my ass off and Initech ships a few extra units, I don't see another dime ...   
Its pretty crazy, and yet here we are. I can see what was described as happening.  Presumably this problem has gotten worse as these files grew, and after release it wasn't something deemed as impacting sales. Or the wrong senior engineer misdiagnosed the problem/overpriced it, and its been stuck on a "sprint after next, when we pay down technical debt" Epic.  
 The fact that this wasn't found shows that over the course of 7 years, not a single person has even attempted to profile and fix this issue.  I wouldn't be surprised if multiple developers found it, pointed it out and got shouted down.  
It can't come from devs, it would have to come from the business side. The fix might be simple, but the process for deciding to work on it might be daunting. Focus groups, surveys, cost estimates (for a problem they don't even understand) and ROI calculations. So it never makes it into the work queue. It just looks like Rockstar just doesn't have any desire to fix things for the sake of fixing things, which would cost them a few full-time positions. Maybe if they had devs who didn't work 90 hour weeks they would have time to play GTAO every once in a while and get the itch to make it faster.  
That's my thought as well. I would even bet the json wasn't even a tenth of the size at launch.  
It was definitely a problem early on. Thats like the whole point here, this has always been a problem for gta5.  
Yeah how has this been forgotten? Even the single player load time is long as hell. How many games take minutes to load?  
I've played *a lot* of GTAO in the last year.  I'm pretty sure the "best game devs" that developed it (not disputing that!) have long since moved onto something else and the core game engine is mostly being maintained by a couple of overworked Eastern European guys making coal miner wages.  There's been virtually no technological improvements to the game in years.  Obviously some investment in content and gameplay (Cayo Perico Heist is great!), but as far as core engine systems I doubt there's much going on there just based on how little investment they are putting into curbing exploits, modders, and other annoyances. Edit:  My comment about Eastern European developers is intended to convey that they‚Äôre incredibly talented and taken advantage of by Western companies by grossly underpaying them.  
Good point. However even more painful to see their work suffer like this. GTA5 was and still is a technical marvel in many regards.  
Yup yup it's just a naive resistance to invest from R* and Take Two.  Ultima Online gets more development investment today than GTAO gets. The game deserves better IMO.  
 a couple of overworked Eastern European guys  This blog post was written by an Eastern European so I'm afraid you'll have to find another ethnicity to blame for Rockstar's failures.  
Aren't Eastern European/Russian devs actually known for being really good, especially at low level coding?  
I think he meant they shouldn't go above and beyond because they are being underpaid. A headline like "GTA V reduces load times by up to 70%" would increase Rockstar's profits. And yet not even 1% of the money made during the first week would go to the team that made it possible. So why bother? I wonder how many problems across could be solved if management threw some crumbs to the right people. Or not even money, merely treating them with respect and dignity will often be enough.  
 I wouldn't believe it if it wasn't for the impressive article.   I would, having seen this problem first-hand several times. Had a good inkling of what it would be (exponential growth through collection iteration) after the first couple of paragraphs. One of the most common progressively-worse performance problems.   I still find it hard to believe this was just not caught.  I would easily believe that unfortunately as well. People who test with small datasets run into this all the time, you really need to be testing with datasets slightly larger than what the customer is using today.  
 anti-cheat  What anti cheat?  
Seriously.  I just started playing.  Been everyday for 2 weeks now.  The loading times are definitely one of the reasons I'm about to quit, but the cheating is absolutely insane.  Every single session I have joined for 14 days in a row has been fucked my modders.  The entire chat is comprised of people looking for hookups from modders.  I don't understand how so many people are cool with it and still play.  
The best game devs in the industry? Why?  
 The biggest game on the planet  iirc, it's even the most profitable piece of media ever produced. baffling.  
Has it really made more money than World of Warcraft? I just kinda figured that WoW was #1.  
Pretty sure WoW is bigger. As of 2017 WoW had pulled in $9.3 billion. In 2018 GTAV's revenue was estimated at around $6 billion. Per the first article, in inflation-adjusted terms both would be behind Space Invaders, Pac-Man and Street Fighter II, which each grossed over $10 billion. Still, they're well ahead of the highest-grossing film of all time, Gone With The Wind, which earned an inflation-adjusted $3.7 billion (half a billion more than second place Avatar at $3.2 billion).  
(I'm not the author; that's just the title of the article.)  
"Now that‚Äôs nice and all, but no one is going to take me seriously unless I test this so I can write a clickbait title for the post."   This made me laugh  
I love how it's the only article posted on the domain Edit: and by love, I mean hate because I wanted to read more exploits by whoever authored this  
I also expected more cool articles. The author is on HN. You can ask him for more cool write-ups https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kuroguro  
I don't think I could put up with even 1m50s of load time. Great job cutting out over 3m though.  
To be fair, if the improvement is consistent, those with modern machines could get it within 18-55 seconds.  
I‚Äôd have played SO MUCH of this game if the loading was at most 1 minute  
And often you would repeatedly have to load in a row because the mission soft locked somehow or the lobby doesn't start or a cheater just took over the lobby. Would be interesting to crunch the numbers on how much electricity the world has spent on GTAV loading times so far. It might even be a significant number.  
The in-game loading is so bad. If you want to join your friends' session, it'll start loading, only minutes later tell you that the session is full, and start loading back into another session. How hard is it to check whether your target session has space before you leave your current session?  
That was a cool article.  
Wow, this is amazing. We should tweet R* to push them to fix this bug!  
I can't even imagine how many dollars they've lost due to this bug. I personally stopped playing GTA Online specifically because of the loading times.  
For me it's a mix of the load times and the fact they do nothing to stop the modders fucking with sessions.  
My 6 friends stopped playing it because of the load times.  
Incoming cease and desist to the blog for sharing decompiled code. Half kidding.  A lot of publishers now just cover everything up with lawyers.  
Claps to the author!!  
He should be paraded around tbh. Collectively the time people have spent waiting for that single core to do this useless work could probably counted in years if not decades.  
It's in the order of magnitude of 5000-20000 years of wasted compute time (if each player loaded gta online 10 times) considering they sold 140 million copies. This is one of those times the leetcode problems seem worth it lol.  
5000 cpu-years on a 200w gaming pc @  0.256 kg  per watt-hour is about 2.2 million metric tonnes of Co2.  
I'd love to know stats on this. How much electricity has been expended on  just checking the same json over and over and over? How much would they have made if they had just mined cryptocurrency on the loading screen instead of doing this?  
Note I doubt very much this comes down to engineer talent, I‚Äôm sure there are engineers yelling I‚Äôd mostly guess this is two things.  They are probably using some kind of off the shelf JSON parser.  The offending stuff is probably deep in some black box dll.   And I would be very surprised if R* doesn‚Äôt know the json parsing is causing that. They‚Äôve probably suggested switching it, but gotten the Kibosh due to the inherent risk there. Management just doesn‚Äôt want to prioritize that.

 I really am surprised they put zero engineering effort into improving performance for their cash cow...  Probably because there's a lack in competition. It's not like the players can go anywhere else. I don't get why they supply the data as JSON at all. It's not like their system is open for 3rd parties. It only needs to deliver the data to their own application that runs on an x86 architecture, so they might as well deliver the list in a binary format that's optimized for C++.

It only needs to deliver the data to their own application that runs on an x86 architecture, so they might as well deliver the list in a binary format that's optimized for C++.  I don't think JSON is really the problem - parsing 10MB of JSON is not so slow. For example, using Python's json.load takes about 800ms for a 47MB file on my system, using something like simdjson cuts that down to ~70ms. I think the problem is more that they didn't go beyond the "it doesn't crash, let's not touch it again" stage. If they managed to botch the JSON parsing in such a way, I think they may also have managed to mess up parsing whatever optimized binary format.  
Yeah simdjson is incredible.  
That's the cool thing about profilers. You don't have to think, you just have to look at the execution time of the functions that are slow.  
[deleted]  
PS3 and Xbox 360 stopped getting updates a long time ago, and I doubt they even pull the same JSON (if at all), since it contains information for all the added content.  
Yea that‚Äôs a good point.  Json is nice for dev, it‚Äôs easy to read and spot bugs but it‚Äôs causing a lot more work for their servers, and driving a lot more data.  That 10 mb file would be dramatically smaller.   They are probably using some kind of azure /aws setup so that kind of optimization would cut their costs a ton!  
I would think some of it might be lack of production dog feeding, their internal build probably doesn't have the massive JSON file, just some internal dev equivalent so they don't notice it impacting their day-to-day work.  
 They are probably using some kind of off the shelf JSON parser.  I had exactly the opposite reaction: that they must have written it themselves. Because what library that pathological would have become successful enough to merit consideration in the first place?  
This is insane. My company dedicates a significant amount of profiling and measurement to startup, where even adding a few milliseconds to startup time gets flagged as something to eliminate if at all possible. That Rockstar never considered similar profiling and protection for their startup times is beyond belief.  
Yeah same here the idea that one of the most popular games on the planet wouldn't have instrumented their startup path to death is pretty shocking. but I've never worked in game dev maybe things are different there  
Difference is your company probably respects their customers more.  
Very well written article. I used to write Game trainers a long time ago, doing a bit of reverse engineering(much lighter that what you can read in the article - the games were also less complex back then). This reading sparked my curiosity, and I sort of want to dig a bit into the software that was mentioned there.  
Absolutely learn ghidra if it interests you. That's how many of the major decompilations are done now (such as mario 64 et )  
When R* reads this, they're all going to know exactly who wrote that terrible parser. You're fired, Sean.  
I thought it was JASON  
The performance problem with sscanf O(N^2) in glibc has been known since at least 2014 (see bug 17577). Ironically, if they'd used fscanf (reading from a file instead of loading it into memory first) the problem wouldn't exist. https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17577  
Man I wish I understood code this well  
Reverse engineering is so fascinating

Cheat Engine?  
I'm always super impressed by articles like this. I probably shouldn't even be in this subreddit because I mostly dick around with Powershell. This article, the Netflix "missing-time" article, and the Linux kernel tcp stack debug from the dev blog of some European retailer remind me that I'm not shit.  
I don't know how to reverse engineer anything, but I liked this article a lot! Could you please share the other articles that you mention? Thanks!  
Yes, here you go! The case of the extra 40ms : programming (reddit.com)  Uncovering a 24-year-old bug in the Linux Kernel : programming (reddit.com)  
Oh, sounds interesting. Got any links? Don't mock powershell, it was my gateway drug to start programming again, I still use powershell sometimes, if I need something quick and dirty. Its just so easy to get something up and running :-)  
Yes, here you go! I'm starting to dabble around in C#/.NET, so perhaps there is hope for me yet! The case of the extra 40ms : programming (reddit.com) Uncovering a 24-year-old bug in the Linux Kernel : programming (reddit.com)  
I wonder how much energy has been wasted in the last 7 years. Maybe not Bitcoin level but certainly quite a bit.  
Imagine it turned out the 7 minute load screens were bitcoin mining. That'd be insane.  
I'm a bit confused, why is sscanf and strlen so bad?  
It calls sscanf() to read each number from the JSON (of which there are a lot) and apparently the implementation of sscanf() is very dumb and calls strlen() which scans to the end of the (very long) string. This seems like a bug in sscanf() to me. A reasonable implementation would not need to call strlen(), but it's still mad that they didn't find such an obvious bug. Edit: I found the code - you can see it here. Interestingly glibc does exactly the same thing. They reuse scanf() which takes a FILE argument, and FILE requires a length, so it calls strlen(). Definitely a bug (a pretty serious one I would have thought!) in Microsoft and GNU's libcs. The GTA developers' code is perfectly reasonable. They did nothing wrong (apart from ignoring such a huge bug for years). Definitely a bug in libc.  
It‚Äôs a classic ‚ÄúSchlemiel the painter‚Äù issue, even down to the reliance on strlen(). Imagine someone painting lines on a road, but instead of carrying the bucket with them, they keep running back to the start to dip their brush again and again. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an issue with sscanf(), though. I‚Äôm not sure how sscanf() could even work if it didn‚Äôt check the length of the incoming string. Rather the issue is the author of the ersatz JSON parser didn‚Äôt understand how sscanf() works and used it inappropriately, which is another element the ‚ÄúSchlemiel the painter‚Äù problem.  
 I‚Äôm not sure how sscanf() could even work if it didn‚Äôt check the length of the incoming string  It doesn't need to check the length, it simply needs to check if the character it's currently on is the null terminator  
it‚Äôs parsing an integer too, so dig = (unsigned char)(*ptr) - (unsigned char)‚Äô0‚Äô;  while(  dig < 10 ) {‚Ä¶} type thing.  A \0 will never be < 10 here.  
 Imagine someone painting lines on a road, but instead of carrying the bucket with them, they keep running back to the start to dip their brush again and again.  Upvoted just for such a simple and effective visualisation of the issue.  Nice  
I didn‚Äôt come up with it; it‚Äôs from Yiddish folklore and it was first used by Joel Spolsky in a CS context.  
They are not bad.  It was their use of it.  Their parser did not scale linearly O(N) with the number of items, but by quadratically O(N^2) which isn't noticeable with a few items but really bogs down over time. I get the feeling their they thought they set it up O(N) but didn't actually test it.  
Or their JSON data grew in size over time, and it was much smaller back when they initially were profiling/testing it  
Wow, this is brilliant. Well done. I hope Rockstar listens.

This guy deserves a reward  
The guy can write Rockstar a $100M bill according to the hammer joke - $1000 to tap, $99,999,000 to know where to tap. Pricing based on value.  
Probably their computers are top tier and always resolved those bugs by changing state to "couldn't reproduce".  
Impossible from my experience. The load times for GTAO never really changed for me while I moved through a lot of hardware since launch. Ryzen 7 3700x - 3600mhz memory and an mvme ssd pushing 2GB/s loads almost as slow as an i5 4770k - 2666mhz memory from spinning disk  
I suspect that this bug will scale with CPU speed, and depending on whether or not the data fits in the cache, memory speed. It shouldn't be IO-bound.

When I worked in a startup whenever we had a bug on a device (mobile) that we couldn't reproduce we just bought the device.  
Makes me wonder if you could just replace the downloaded JSON string with something much shorter through a proxy server and decrease the loading times that way. You might not have the items in game, but if it's not game breaking, could be a win  
 Makes me wonder if you could just replace the downloaded JSON string with something much shorter through a proxy server and decrease the loading times that way.  They almost certainly could.  In the past people just memory mapped files and loaded them straight into memory.  
They could switch to protobufs.  
R: we are aware of this issue and we have a team sent out to fix this R: ‚Äúthat‚Äôll shut them up‚Äù  
 Most of the results I found pointed towards anecdata about¬†how the game is so sophisticated¬†that it needs to load so long  Is one of my most favorite thing to hear over and over. And it's out there for EVERY game. Happy to see that common misconception get a nod.  
Here is the Intel press release he is referencing: https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-responds-to-security-research-findings/  
"Intel believes its products are the most secure in the world and that, with the support of its partners, the current solutions to this issue provide the best possible security for its customers."  
I wish we could hold marketing accountable for such statements.    Intel believes its products are the most secure in the world    Yeah... well, they're not. So anything you believe, say, or do from here on out will be taken with a grain of salt.  
They say  "we believe" so we cant hold them accountable for it.  
I mean, if you would check internal documents I‚Äôm pretty sure they don‚Äôt believe so. Even if we can‚Äôt hold them accountable by law we can hold them accountable by moral. They talk BS.  
It's opinion and not phrased any way to make it a direct claim or guarantee.  
Was that written by a Markov chain?  
Here at Intel we are going to be spiders. We just are.  
by Markov Unchained  
It is pretty hard to increase the bullshit density in that sentence.  
That quote gave me cancer.  
It gave me a sense of pride and accomplishment.  
Most secure in the world my ass. New Intel processors ship with a hardware backdoor called "Management Engine" (ME). It's intended purpose was for admins to configure a Computer remotely via local Network. Of course a bug was found that can be exploited over the Internet. The best part is, an attacker will get full control over the machine as the "Management Engine" runs at a lower system level than the operating system itself. No AntiVirus Software or Operating System would even notice.  
Compare and contrast to AMD: https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/speculative-execution  
AMD:  Total protection from all possible attacks remains an elusive goal and this latest example shows how effective industry collaboration can be.  Intel:  Intel believes its products are the most secure in the world and that, with the support of its partners, the current solutions to this issue provide the best possible security for its customers.   
Oh look, another reason to buy AMD.  
Would gladly upgrade to Ryzen but the current DDR4 prices are just stupid, so unfortunately I'll have to stay with my DDR3 Intel setup for the time being... (Also AMD is basically non-existent on server hardware)  
Damn.  I was expecting some deflection or dismissing of the issue, but they're hardcore about the consumer.  Even listing unrelated safety tips for beginners at the end. So glad I reserved another Ryzen 7 last week, my new computers are going to all be AMD exclusive.  
I just wish there were more AMD notebooks that are decent like the Thinkpad T series. Or ARM64.  
Ryzen is just so fucking good. I don't see a lot of marketing (I think AMDs downfall) but not having to drop a ridiculous amount of money and having some great cpu is just fucking fantastic. I honestly jizz in my shorts a little at the thought of running shine shitty script in parallel in an EPYC environment.  
AMD:  Variant One - [...] - Resolved by software [...]  Researchers:  A PoC for variant 1 that [...] can perform arbitrary reads in a 4GiB range [3] in kernel virtual memory on the Intel Haswell Xeon CPU. If the kernel's BPF JIT is enabled (non-default configuration), it also works on the AMD PRO CPU. (Source: https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.de/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html)  I'm not happy that they're basically saying: "Don't implement JIT compilers in kernel space assuming that our CPU works according to the specification." I would guess it's possible that this problem could return in the next JIT compiler or maybe even a regular kernel function if the code is not thoroughly checked.  
"Don't implement JIT compilers in kernel space" seems a generally sound sounding bit of advice either which way ;)  
Do you know what the BPF is?  Would you want to slow down your network stack with a context switch on every packet?  A JIT does not necessarily mean a Turing-complete beast that we can't prove sound.

 unintended consequence  Sounds like a fancy word for a bug  
The operation was a success but the patient died - Intel  
| Recent reports that these exploits are caused by a ‚Äúbug‚Äù or a ‚Äúflaw‚Äù and are unique to Intel products are incorrect. The missing text significantly alters the meaning. I assume they are trying to hide behind the fact that some AMD products were also vulnerable as if that‚Äôs a valid defense.   
Not even AMD. It's some ARM implementations that are apparently vulnerable. AMD is clear.  
 A PoC that demonstrates the basic principles behind variant 1 in userspace on the tested Intel Haswell Xeon CPU, the AMD FX CPU, the AMD PRO CPU and an ARM Cortex A57 [2]  Intel is by far in the worst shape, and the most serious problem appear to be intel-only right now. But the optimization technique itself appears to be a risky design choice so many architectures are affected.  AMD‚Äôs fixes will probably not have the performance impact we are hearing about with Intel‚Äôs much worse issues.   
Well they did work as designed. Their design was just bad.  
 Their design was just bad.  I'd say the design simply didn't address security at all. Someone got task "improve performance", and security was not on the requirements list, so was not considered :)  
This is the root cause for 99% of security vulnerabilities.  
Security should always be on the list when considering design. Doesn't matter what level or if it's hardware or software. This should be as ubiquitous in the industry as checklists are in hospitals. I mean, I made myself laugh just saying that, but I still think it's true even if it'll never happen.  
But the increased performance of the past 20 years is primarily from complexity. You can make a CPU that runs one operation at a time, no matter what. It will a hell of a lot slower than today's CPUs are, for equivalent price.  
Ya the problem is to most consumers security doesn't mean shit till it effects them. My chip is more secure than yours! well ours run 30% faster than yours!  Most consumers are going to pick the one that runs 30% faster...But I agree with you, security is a top priority and always should be.  
It probably was on the checklist. Unfortunately the complexity of these attacks (and that they took many years to be found) suggests that without spending months focusing on the security of this specific part of the chip design the flaws would have been missed. There's a balance these companies strike with making the perfect product and releasing a product. Perfection is impossible, so they have to cut a release eventually. There's also a reason computer security is one of the highest payed fields. It's really hard even before considering hardware logic security.  
This is just so obviously unfair and untrue! :) The vulnerabilities have been with us for over two decades.  Only in 2016 or so did Angus Fogh and others start mulling things... These vulnerabilities are blindingly simple and obvious in hind sight. We can all wish we'd spotted them, and can be glad someone finally did :) Cache attacks leak decisions made by others.  Only very recently - 2015 or so - did the cache attacks really take off. Hands up everyone who wants to not have caches?  
[deleted]  
More like 20 years...  
The idea isn't all that new; variations on this theme are e.g.:  Cache Missing for Fun and Profit (2005) Covert and Side Channels due to Processor Architecture (2006)  It's 2018 now.  There was never any need for exceptional foresight; the basics of this design flaw were known and documented beforehand. This should have been preventable. Particularly Meltdown - while Spectre when applied within a single process and thus a single single security context isn't necessarily the responsibility of the CPU (although a little help wouldn't be amiss), given the previous work here, Meltdown seems downright negligent.  
All Intel processors after the Pentium Pro are vulnerable.  
 Recent reports that these exploits are caused by a ‚Äúbug‚Äù or a ‚Äúflaw‚Äù and are unique to Intel products are incorrect.   Well, if you want to follow they "explanation principle":   Their design was just ‚Äúbad‚Äù.   
It's not a bug, it's a feature!  
[deleted]  
I've seen this from a game developer.  "That's not a bug, because the implementation matches the requirements!"  But the requirements are clearly wrong.  
or you could get your tinfoil hat out, and it is working as designed- exploitable by giant government agencies who know these chips are in everything, in a way that can fly under the radar for a decade or two. edit: forgotten word  
That doesn't even begin to make sense.  The NSA/CIA/DOD themselves run hundreds of thousands of servers and workstations on the same exact same Intel hardware that you use.  Also, this attack would be near useless to the intelligence community.  You can only really exploit it if you're already able to run code on the same physical hardware as your target, and this vulnerability has been getting built into hardware since before cloud computing was even a thing. The Management Engine issues - I could totally see that being some NSA backdoor.  However, insecure branch prediction would be a weird rabbit hole to program in.  
But it‚Äôs possible to write software that adds delays, and which mitigates the ability to use this side channel. The Mozilla blog just posted what they‚Äôre doing in Firefox to close the hole while the bug persists[1]. So someone who knows of the bug can protect themselves from it.  OTOH ... these kinds of deliberate holes tend to be penny wise and pound foolish, flawed for the same reason as security by obscurity and trusting the enemy not to know the system. The costs of working around the deficiency tend to vastly exceed the security advantages.  [1] Edit: Link.  
 So someone who knows of the bug can protect themselves from it.   That's not right. Google wrote a paper showing how one can use speculative execution to read information where it shouldn't. This was demoed in two ways Meltdown:   - a bug in the processor that means a process can bypass security and read stuff outside it's process. Sceptre:   - we also have readahead in the more "run-time" like langauges, like JS in a browser. By doing a similar approach but at a different level we can bypass the web browser's checks and read stuff within the browser process. The kernel level security still applies, it's the same approach and similar style of attack, but a completely different one. Mozilla are fixing the bug they have, they're not mitigating the bug Intel has.  
Thing is, they don't receive the same silicon that you or I use. As to Meltdown/Spectre - sure, they were most probably the result of systemic errors during the design process and as such neither intentional or malicious. Hanlon's razor. However, regardless of intent, that doesn't stop these vulnerabilities from being exploited, and once the TLAs discover such vulnerabilities exist - which is most likely months, if not years before they become public knowledge - they probably wouldn't be above asking Chipzilla nicely to turn a blind eye so that they can quietly take advantage of the situation.  
 this attack would be near useless  privilege escalation isn't useless , just saying.  
[deleted]  
 You can only really exploit it if you're already able to run code on the same physical hardware as your target  One of their examples are running JavaScript in a browser. You are literally running a program (this page) from the Internet right now. So get someone to run your webpage in their browser. Read cookies to gmail from browser memory. Surely NSA would be interested in that.  
As bad as these attacks are, let's remember that most RAM vendors haven't fixed ROWHAMMER after all these years. The state of computer security is very poor. Running untrusted code on your computer is unwise. That includes javascript.  
AFAIU, DDR4 makes exploitation much more difficult however because it calibrates refresh rates on startup. I'd love to see a proper recent report about that however because I don't have one.  
DDR4 uses Target Row Refresh which identifies and refreshes victim rows. This is a direct rowhammer mitigation  
What bothers me more is that today OS installers don't seem to offer rowhammer testing on the specific system, etc.  It would seem to have been prudent that a bottom-up common discussion be to test systems when assembled/upgraded, such as everyday topic of /r/BuildAPCSales - but I really don't see it treated as a practical thing to check for (like a termite inspection on a house)  
Yeah, I think after all these years we're finally getting ready to come down to this conclusion :) Unfortunately all those effective managers will take this as a cue to sing "trusted as in trusted by us, Microsofts and Intels. Lets only allow signed code to run".  
 Yeah, I think after all these years we're finally getting ready to come down to this conclusion :)  more like, after all these years it should be apparent that no one really gives that much of a shit about security, or at least much less than security experts would like to. What could happen ? Best case: you're getting your CC number stolen. Big deal. Call your bank and they block the account & revert the last few transactions. Worst case: large-scale global hack on every computer of the world due to big-ass bot net. Governments ask providers to shut down internet for some time. Maybe there's a few deaths, who cares about this anyways. Life continues as usual.  
[deleted]  
My teeth rotting is a different level of problem, than a hypothetical grand scale hack exploiting some percentage of CPUs with this issue. If one group used this to to take over just 1% of potentially vulnerable machines the could move hundreds of billions of dollars and potentially kill many. Botnets are real and taking real money with just software exploits now.  
i mean the entire us population literally carries around personally-identifiable gps-enabled tracking devices equipped with video cameras, microphones, running a proprietary operating system of which some or all of the code is not open source, into which many of us frequently enter all of our personal information, including credit card and bank information, as well as signing into things like online banking and financial portfolios. We clearly don't care about security anymore.  
 We clearly don't care about security anymore.  Your argument doesn't provide any sort of indication that the level of concern has changed over time. That's just an arbitrary conclusion that doesn't follow the evidence laid out. We still clearly don't want our nudes being captured surreptitiously, we don't want our private conversations broadcasted, and we don't want strangers following us around. We aren't carrying these devices around because "we clearly don't care about security anymore".  
Don't forget that people are intentionally putting a wiretap in every corner of their house so they can ask it questions about their schedule.   
Well now you put it like that. Richard Stallman woz right.  
 As bad as these attacks are, let's remember that most RAM vendors haven't fixed ROWHAMMER after all these years.  Isn't that something that needs to be fixed in the memory controller, i.e. in the Intel and AMD CPUs?  
There's Target Row Refresh, which has been supported  since Ivy Bridge. It still requires the DRAM modules to support TRR, though.  
TIL. Now I know what feature to look for in the next memory upgrade.  
How well would ECC RAM deal with Rowhammer?  
Rowhammer is actually a pretty common test to validate ECC on platforms/CPUs that have it enabled but not certified. e.g. Ryzen CPUs on consumer AM4 motherboards.  
Good to know, thanks   
ECC + DDR4 with the TRR and MAC counters row hammer   
So when do we get our $25 coupon towards the purchase of a new Intel processor from the resulting lawsuit? /s  
Thing about the enterprise guys who paid $1-$5k for a processor.  Do you think $25 is going to appease them? I feel bad for the mid to small companies who don‚Äôt have the clout or capital to easily compensate for a performance loss, especially any of them that may be cloud storage companies.   Ouch.

Linus is pretty much one of the biggest public facing developers who has the right to complain about hardware stuff. He doesn't give a shit about PR, it's all unfiltered opinions on shit companies try to do to his system. He doesn't favour any specific just is on the side of Linux itself.   
 He doesn't give a shit about PR  Of course he does. His target audience is just very, very different than what Intel PR has... but he certainly has one.  
 His target audience is just very, very different than what Intel PR has  His target audience is the people deciding what hardware to buy. On all levels. Not "mom decides to buy a motorola instead of a samsung" decisions. But "Hey team, what about we re-evaluate the coice of chips for our next chromebook and Google flagship android phone line?"  
 "Hey team, what about we re-evaluate the coice of chips for our next chromebook and Google flagship android phone line?"  Non-technical Manager: "No. We have a deal with Intel."  
He's also totally qualified on the topic. Few others have been working as close to the metal as he has for as long as he has, certainly not with the public profile he has.   
His only paid job besides Linux was in Transmeta where they designed   x86 compatible processor and code morphing software for it. Here is his constructive deeply technical criticism of Nvidia.  
The shit's been in every Intel chip for the last 20 years.  That nobody on the Kernel team caught on during that time shows just how deeply buried it is.  
No no no, the issue was known since pentium 3 times, but it was dismissed as unexploitable. The first real PoC was published in 2016. Googler are certainly not the first to arrive to the party.  
2006 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.190.1003&rep=rep1&type=pdf  Information leakage through covert channels and side channels is becoming a serious problem, especially when these are enhanced by modern processor architecture features. We show how processor architecture features such as simultaneous multithreading, control speculation and shared caches can inadvertently accelerate such covert channels or enable new covert channels and side channels.   
Interesting paper, but it doesn't have that much to do with the current attacks. The closest it gets (section 3.4) is about using microarchitecture state left over by speculative execution to create a covert communication channel between two isolated processes. It also leans heavily on very Itanium-specific architecture details. The key points about the new attacks are that you can speculatively fetch data from pages that shouldn't be accessible at your privilege level (Meltdown) or convince a privileged confused deputy to do such a speculative access for you (Spectre), and then transmit that information out of the (normally completely hidden) speculative execution state by speculatively accessing cache lines you do have access to based on the hidden value. That's the fancy new trick you need to connect to the existing concept of a cache timing attack. If you have any 10-year-old papers describing a possibility like that I'd be curious, but I doubt there are any.  
What does PoC mean in this context?

It's just really great seeing Linus say things nobody else will. He's the one person that always calls out bullshit while having enough clout that people won't yell at him.  
Though honestly, I would have expected a few more expletives on an issue this large and how it's currently being handled by Intel, specially after the CEO selling as much stock as he could  
In a litigious world where to admit a mistake of this magnitude would cost them a lot in lawsuits. Is anyone surprised they won't admit it?  
See the much better AMD response.  Clearly, they could've handled it much better.  
Well to be fair, AMD has a LOT less to disclose.  I'm not excusing Intel and especially not their CEO, but AMD's burden is quite a bit easier to manage.  
Financially it may not really be a mistake until they admit it  
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/00a5ae218d57741088068799b810416ac249a9ce#diff-678874d00bf0df04f6f427f16f1dea36R926 Code regarding the Intel CPU flaw is not run on AMD chips.  
That patch is only about Meltdown, it doesn't do anything for Spectre. Spectre does work on AMD and even on non x86 architectures. It has been demonstrated on ARM and is fully expected to work on modern PPC and MIPS.  
that exploit runs on more platforms than java and next to java i probably still prefer it  
Sentiment like this just drives up Java dev salary.  
Reasons to invest more time in Java :-)  
But it sure lightens the load to pretend it does in PR statements.  
Note that Intel opposed this patch! They're really working round the clock to convince people that there is no Intel-specific problem.  
I think his statement in the patch thread was quite reasonable. All he asked was for there to be a command line option to enable it on all CPUs regardless of manufacturer.  
While it's possible the critique was well intentioned, the patch already made it possible to do so. The way i see it - He did ask for more than just that option, he also wanted to not hard-code it in a way to say one vendor has never and will never be affected.  
 All he asked was for there to be a command line option to enable it on all CPUs regardless of manufacturer.  That's been in the patch since early days. He was effectively asking for the hard coded vendor check to be overridable.   
Maybe I should take a page from Intel's book. I really like the idea of getting a bug report and being like "no, that code runs exactly the way we wrote it."  
Every bug tracking system I know of includes something along the lines of "Not a bug" in their close reasons.  
Isn't the problem that everything works as designed, but it is designed as crap?  
Yes. But they prefer the term "not as good as it might have been"  
 but it is designed as crap  Not really. It was designed to boost performance, and it does that just fine. Simply no-one considered the security implications of this.  
It's not really true to say that security wasn't considered at all. Speculative execution is designed to wait for security checks before making the results of execution visible by conventional means. That's why the attack relies on detecting the results via unconventional means, by information leaking through side-channels such as how long it takes to access something in memory. It's likely that engineers did consider the possibility of these side-channel attacks, they've been speculated about for some time, but didn't think there was any practical way to use them.  
 It's likely that engineers did consider the possibility of these side-channel attacks, they've been speculated about for some time, but didn't think there was any practical way to use them.  This is what I think, too. Remember that the Core microarchitecture is over a decade old; virtualization and cloud computing was in its infancy (Azure didn't exist until 2010 and Amazon EC2 exited beta in 2008). Attackers would've needed direct access to a machine to be able to exploit this, so I'm guessing that it wasn't really a big deal at the time.  
All designs are trade-offs. You want a secure computer? Make sure it's never or  almost never connected to the Internet. Some wallets for crypto currency are exactly like this; makes it damn inconvenient for a lot of other things, though.  
Maybe some engineers at Intel did, but management didn't give it priority, because the performance gains were considered more important, and so any security issues were dismissed and overlooked as not not much to worry about. Just some speculation, but I wouldn't be too surprised if it were close to the truth.  
It's not designed as crap. It's pretty subtle.  
"Let he who is without bugs cast the first stone." And yes I know this kind of hardware should be the apex of design scrutiny, but come on it is something so subtle that it wasn't recognized for 12 years.  
I still dont understand how could js code exploit these vulnerabilities  
Chrome 64 is mitigating the security issue by lowering the timing resolution of Performance.now() to 20 us, but I think that's only a temporary solution. https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/ssca  
Firefox is implementing the same 20us mitigation, too.  
Even Edge is in on the party.  
But is IE11? Asking for a friend  
The researchers said they worked around that by using a decrementing counter as a high-resolution clock replacement, and it worked fine. Basically impossible to block, as well.  
In the end, JS is translated to machine code just like everything else. It's just another programming language running on your computer. It shouldn't have access to much, being in a browser environment and all, but at the end of the day that's just a detail and not a particular important one.  
The subtlety is that it requires specific CPU instructions, for some of these exploits (Meltdown), which wouldn't be produced by JavaScript.  
The reason Meltdown isn't accessible from JS isn't a lack of access to specific machine instructions, it's a lack of arbitrary memory access. Meltdown happens by speculatively executing assembly past a page fault. Javascript doesn't let you create raw pointers (unless you also have a bug in your js transpiler) so you can't trigger this. Spectre doesn't require raw pointers, only branch prediction pollution (execute a lot of branches that are positive, to train the predictor to think similar branches will be positive) and the ability to measure L1 cache population via precise timing measurements. You can't do anything about the former, so browser vendors are considering ways to make the latter more difficult.  
FYI a transpiler specifically doesn't produce machine code, byte code, or assembly language, and instead produces high level language code. It's also not a universally agreed upon distinction. But a JIT engine that runs JS is definitely a compiler, not a transpiler.  
It might sound stupid, but I really like this explanation. I kinda knew it already, but it just clicked well with me. Thanks. :)   
In Spectre paper there is an example... tl;dr: javascript gets translated to assembly/machine code before execution because your CPU can only run machine code. It gets translated in predictable way, so you know exactly what code will run on target machine and it doesn't matter if the initial code was written in javascript or anything else. Both attacks depend on the fact that you can run code on target machine, and in case of javascript you can.  
If I'm not mistaken, meltdown also depends on the fact that you can execute a custom and illegal memory access (which would result in a page fault if executed in-order). I don't think that's possible in javascript.  
The code example is from the Spectre paper, not the Meltdown one. They are two or threee related but not exactly the same flaws.  
Javascript cannot be used to read kernel memory with this vulnerability, nor can it be used to "take over" your computer. However, researchers were able to construct a javascript program using the same technique that lets the javascript code escape the sandboxing and read memory from within its own process. So if two web pages are using the same process (which has been normal until now), information could leak between the two.  
But doesn't Chrome (and recently firefox?) spawn a new process for each tab? I though that was why Chrome was so memory heavy and why a crash in one tab does not affect the whole browser? If so, this exploit shouldn't affect Chrome?  
Not always, no. Chrome will spawn a new process when you open a new tab but if you click a link it can re-use the same process as the page you came from and I believe iframes share a process with the parent page. The next release of chrome will include options to never let different sites share processes, but this will lead to a 10-20% increase in memory consumption.  
IIRC, after a certain number of tab Chrome start reusing process.  
"Intel believes these exploits do not have the potential to corrupt, modify or delete data." Clever. Leaving out steal or read.   
Read the context. Anything can sound stupid or malicious if you drop enough context.  have the potential to improperly gather sensitive data from computing devices that are operating as designed. Intel believes these exploits do not have the potential to corrupt, modify or delete data.   
Must be kind of painful to have all this memory protection infrastructure on your chip, only to find out that it has been completely worthless. I wonder whether there is anything in the Intel architecture documentation specifying that user-space really cannot access kernel space memory. (Leaking enough information to reconstruct kernel space memory is equivalent of course. ) I.e., the manual does state that direct accesses are forbidden, but whether they guarantee anything beyond that?  
If it prevented attacks then it wasn't worthless.  
The memory protection support in processors is designed to fulfill the needs of operating systems, not some abstract need: processors need to read from memory to do useful work. It is operating systems that want to isolate processes from one another, and they generally need hardware assistance to do so efficiently. The underlying issue is that operating systems are finding more and more possible exploits, so that they need more and more robust protection against complicated threat models. And this kind of side-channel attack means the drive for more performance using speculative execution, etc., (which is a direct requirement of the processor) is not available to the OS's defending against this exploit. Until this kind of exploit was discovered, things like timing attacks using deliberate kernel protection faults were not obviously part of the OS requirements. I think it is completely unfair of Linus and other to expect that hardware magically protect against all side channel attacks including undiscovered ones. That would require either supremely conservative performance (slow down everything to match the slowest path, so that there is no timing attack), or insanely complicated design to figure out where performance gains could only include provably safe variations in time.  
 I think it is completely unfair of Linus and other to expect that hardware magically protect against all side channel attacks including undiscovered ones.   Is that what he's doing, though?  He wants them to admit there is a serious problem and stop spinning it as a Nothing Burger (TM).  
Well, he has declared the CPU's "crap" designed in a way that is not "competent." If this attack channel was so goddamn obvious, why hasn't the Linux kernel been aggressively considering timing attacks like these and already had these protections in place? The answer is that just about every freaking kernel programmer was ignoring the issue as well. But, hey, not going to call them incompetent crap engineers, are we? No, that must have all been on the hardware folks. Any design has to be made in the context of requirements: someone high up would have to say "no timing attacks possible against attempted memory protection violations" before you could say that. I don't think any CPU vendor has that in mind, I'm guessing if they avoided such faults, it's because they got lucky when designing the memory protection logic and weren't being as aggressive in developing their speculative execution. The other aspect is that you can have legitimate disagreement about where the line between OS and hardware support lies. If there is a tradeoff between side-channel exposure and performance, the hardware guy can't deliver maximum performance unless he lets the software opt out. Then whoever is delivering the software needs to decide whether their system should slow down to be more secure (e.g. flushing more stuff on protection faults). If I'm running an Intel CPU with all my code and no external code, why the fuck should I have to possibly slow down my memory accesses to prevent me spying on myself?  
I think Linus' and the kernel guys' ire is mostly aimed at the Meltdown hole, which is specific to Intel (and a single ARM chip). That one seems to indicate that Intel's MMUs don't immediately deny accesses to pages not accessible at the current privilege level, and instead defer such check (or at least the reaction to it) to when the instruction gets retired. This was arguably a questionable decision, and without knowing any deep details about microarchitecture design and optimization I can't come up with an obvious reason why it would be "better" than the alternative which AMD apparently went with. It's kinda part of the Linux dev culture to call every bad thing "stupid" or "crap" if they didn't write it themselves anyway, so I'm not surprised they're doing that here too. It is causing them a lot of pain and headaches, after all. The Spectre stuff is completely different, and that's the kernel dev's responsibility just as much as the hardware vendors. I think every good systems engineer would have agreed that this was possible if you had explained the attack step by step to them... yet nobody realized it on their own for all these years. I think that one just came completely out of the left field and nobody saw it coming, and it's hard to point at one specific "flaw" that is at fault... it just happens to allow a bad result after you put all the seemingly benign bits together.  
The press release says they do not believe the flaws allow hackers to delete or manipulate data, but recent news reports never said the flaws allowed that ... the N.Y. Times says it allows for hackers to potentially copy/steal the entire memory contents of your computer/mobile phone.   
And the memory contents of cloud servers *  
This should worry people more than their phone or home PC. In reality, hackers don't give a crap about the average person when a cloud server can potentially have thousands of accounts with passwords etc. The cloud servers will be the big payoff for these people, not some porn watchers on their PC at home.   
Obviously there has to be some rethink. Until now it was considered to be okay to allow knock-on effects of data you fetched (without permission) to affect the behavior of your program as long as you couldn't directly read the data. Yes, in retrospect it is clearly foolish. But I don't see how that jibes with what Linus is saying. The entire industry thought this was okay. It isn't the kind of thing where you can just say you didn't work hard enough, it required a different mindset. And now of course with this new perspective CPU architectures will be done differently.  
I agree Intel needs to fix their processors but isn't this an universal issue? The Meltdown paper mentions, in section 6.4, that for ARM and AMD "out-of-order execution generally occurs and instructions past illegal memory accesses are also performed". And Spectre also works on ARM and AMD architecture. Edit: As several people have pointed out, the current variant of Meltdown doesn't work on AMD. This patch confirms this.  
[deleted]  
 but these can be fixed without patching the kernel.  To be more precise, these have to be fixed without patching the kernel. There is no sane* kernel patch which could fix userspace to userspace leakages. *There are several insane patches kernel patches you could do; Things like disabling all memory caches or disabling all branch prediction, but these would result in an absolutely massive performance degradation.  
All I could hear reading this was linus saying "WE DON'T BREAK USERSPACE" edit: I'm bad. touch -> break  
"Break". It's "We don't break userspace". Unfortunately the current state of userspace is broken, so if performance has to take hit in order to fix it, then so be it. Make it configurable if necessary for the people who runs absolutely no untrusted code and requires performance (bitcoin miners?), but frankly, for most people it's better to have a correctly executing CPU than a fast one.  
Well, people are considering clearing the branch prediction tables on context switches, which is a slightly less insane kernel patch. https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/1/4/382  
 The Meltdown paper mentions, in section 6.4, that for ARM and AMD "out-of-order execution generally occurs and instructions past illegal memory accesses are also performed".  As far as I understand the toy example in 3 only shows that out of order execution has observable effects, however it does not involve any secret fetched from the kernel and instead uses a fixed value to perform the out of order load, nothing really questionable about that1 . The exploit itself tries to fetch a value from kernel memory to perform the lookup and that could not be reproduced on AMD.   And Spectre also works on ARM and AMD architecture.  Different exploit that actually affects all and isn't fixed by the recent patch afaik.  1 Actually it might make it impossible for an in process sandbox to hide anything reliably from untrusted code. Then again, who regularly runs large amounts of untrusted code on his system. Most people just browse anyway and we all know that the few hundred scripts and ad providers on cnn.com are completely trustworthy.  
That's true. They were unable to successfully leak kernel memory. Although they do mention that an optimized or modified version may succeed even on ARM and AMD.  
The paper says that they don't know why and just assume that it may be possible. This kernel patch says that it isn't on AMD.  
That kernel patch is not really authoritative on this though. Far as I'm aware it's basing this off the results of the papers so referencing it here is circular reasoning. Unless you have something more showing this was based upon actual research on how the ad chips function?   
1 of the 3 attacks works on AMD processors (but with a more complex exploit than Intel that requires more cooperation from the kernel) and 1 particular ARM model. It's still an issue, but it's a much bigger issue for Intel than for anyone else.  
 out-of-order execution generally occurs and instructions past illegal memory accesses are also performed  That does not necessarily mean that the illegal memory access is executed itself and has impact on the cache. Out-of-order execution also means, that independent instructions can be executed at the same time on different execution units. For example, you could have a an illegal load instruction followed by an ALU instruction  on some unrelated register. The CPU starts to execute the load instruction and before it notices that it is illegal it already starts excecuting the ALU instruction. It appears that the illegal load instruction has no impact on the cache on non-Intel CPUs. So, we continued out-of-order execution past an illegal memory access, but didn't leak memory into the cache.  
I'd just like to interject for a moment. Who you‚Äôre referring to as Linus, is in fact, GNU/Linus, or as I‚Äôve recently taken to calling him, GNU plus Linus.  
Good lord these fucking comments and armchair CPU designers.  Lol, reddit never fails to entertain at least.

I think Intel knows they have problems, why else would the ceo dump company stock?  
 I think Intel knows they have problems  99% of that is of their own doing though. They have been becoming less and less competitive over time and trying to rest on their lead. I know quite a few people that work there and they say it's a shitshow. Mostly things like dumping projects and realising they were needed and restarting them or reinventing the wheel because of flawed logic. Just management fuckery, trying to seem like you are busy but you are just moving paper from one table to another.   why else would the ceo dump company stock  The stock is overpriced as it is, in a few years given the current strategy from them I wouldn't be surprised if it was in a much worse state.   
They've been flying around with no direction for quite a few years now. They were too late to get into the smart phone processor market, and have been going into several directions at once after they blew it. I'm glad I dumped their shares a while back. Any company they touch or buy seems to get poisoned or withers on the vine.   
 They were too late to get into the smart phone processor market, and have been going into several directions at once after they blew it  Well too late getting into phones in general, ARM was there in the pre-smartphone era.   
Honestly?  He gets a large portion of his compensation in company stock; he is required to keep 250k shares.  Anything over and above that is cashed out and diversified, probably on an annual basis.  Pretty smart. Google indicated that their engineers shared these findings with Intel on Jun 1, 2017, so his recent stock dump is unlikely to have been related.  
 Google indicated that their engineers shared these findings with Intel on Jun 1, 2017, so his recent stock dump is unlikely to have been related.  If you look at the timeline:  Intel was notified. (June) Intel had a quarterly investors meeting where they didn't mention that a bug this big existed to investors. (?) Intel CEO puts in stock plan. (October?) Stock plan executes. (November?) Bug becomes public. (January)  it's entirely possible that the CEO's stock plan was affected by the not-yet-public news.  
If he does the same thing every year at the same moment, should he have change is investment tactics? I doubt its insider trading if he have been doing the same things for years.  
You can look at his history of sales and how much stock he‚Äôs held in reserve. This current sale is six times larger than any previous sale bringing him down to a position that‚Äôs smaller than any previous position he‚Äôs held that all does seem suspect.  http://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/insiders/krzanich-brian-m-872413  
That's definitely not an eloquent quote.  
The stupid thing about how software patents work is that if you don't apply for it, anybody else could try to do so later and if they succeed (which is always a chance since patent officers often have no idea what the fuck they're doing), they can fuck you over with it. I could imagine that Google just decided to try as hard as possible to patent whatever the fuck they can about this important new technology... if they fail, they at least made (relatively) certain that nobody else can later do it either. The best option for the inventor would've probably been to patent it himself and grant the world an irrevokable royalty-free license, rather than not patenting it at all. Patents are not free, unfortunately, but it seems that he cares enough about this that he might have been willing to put out the money. With the way this stupid system works, the only way you can make sure that nobody else takes it is to claim it for yourself.  
[deleted]  
An expensive process that could sink a lot of people. I believe people that work at the patent office have already come out and said they mostly look at already issued patents as proof of prior existence if it's not there they approve and just let people challenge it in court. Essentially not doing their job and putting the burden on the judicial system. Things so stupid like using a stick to play fetch are patented. Common sense is not allowed to be used when approving or denying patents.   
[deleted]  
[removed]  
Well the article says that both Apple and Facebook have both used this technique to create software, does this increase the chances of it go to court? I know they jave no shortage of money.  
[deleted]  
 Things so stupid like using a stick to play fetch are patented.  Stupid things like this are the reason why people can't innovate without large companies bullying them and stealing their ideas.  We can't do something as simple as make a video game because some patent troll will try to claim they patented something you made and go to sue you if you ever start to become successful.  
[deleted]  
I didn't say lazy. Just that they have pushed what most people would believe to be their responsibilities onto someone else. The reasons why they do that could be many things. They don't have the knowledge to know what they are looking at, they don't have time to research appropriately or they don't have the tools. The reason doesn't really matter at this point.  
 Essentially not doing their job and putting the burden on the judicial system  This is the only sensible thing they could do. The cost and difficulty of really deciding if a patent should be valid is immense. Making that effort for every filed patent would be hugely wasteful and downright insane. Instead, the patent granting process is a sort of first-pass filter that eliminates patents that are unequivocally bad, but doesn't try to be conclusive. Sure, this leads to waste when patents get contested, but the waste is much less, and the burden is shouldered by interested private parties instead of being paid for with tax dollars. I do think that there are serious problems with the patent system, but having the patent office do more work up front is not the solution to any of them.  
 The cost and difficulty of really deciding if a patent should be valid is immense.  Which is why, if the public is going to enforce patents at all, it should shoulder more of that burden. The economic disparity between a single inventor and Google is immense. It's not rule of law, but might makes right if in a practical sense, only the largest companies can effectively contest a patent claim. You can't stand there on one hand and enforce patents and claim fairness when on the other you have a system where the small guy can never win, no matter the merit of his claims. If you're going to enforce a right by law and force, then you have the responsibility to make a reasonably good-faith effort not to award that right unfairly, even if that costs you money. Otherwise, you're effectively working on behalf of only the richest who can afford to put up indefinite lawyer money, using the excuse of not "wasting tax dollars."  
From what I gather from the article, this is less of a question of who invented it and more of a question of whether Google added enough on their own to be worth an independent patent. This is even more reason why the original inventor should have patented it himself, I think. Because then he could have set license terms that prevent others from doing a tiny bit of derivative work and then claiming their own patent on that. We really need something like a copyleft for patents.  
It would have cost a lot of money (and time) for the original inventor to get a patent. I remember when I was working at Nortel and started the process for a patent (which my manager decided to stop), we were told that it would probably be about 18-24 months and cost somewhere from $10000 to $20000. The actual filing cost is a lot lower, but given the amount of time you need patent lawyers to examine and prepare the patent, it adds up.  
How much does it cost to register a patent? And would that automatically be valid in all countries?  
US patent filing fees are roughly $250-$1000 depending on the size of the company filing the application. Total costs will be $8000-$25000 when you include parent drafting and prosecution costs, assuming you do not represent yourself.  A patent is only enforceable in the country where it is applied for. There are ways to register rights in other countries which do not have their own patent offices. EP parents are more nuanced.     
Algorithms shouldn't be patentable anyways as they are just mathematical formula.  
They aren't. Applications of algorithms are patentable, but the algorithm itself isn't.  
[deleted]  
It doesn't even have to go to court. Look up inter partes review.  
Don't have to go to court to invalidate the patent.  
Only under first to invent, I think. And the US changed to first to file a few years ago. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_to_file_and_first_to_invent  
So if I add a public license, like gpl, to my code someone could still patent it?  
I'm not really sure, I'm not a patent lawyer. There's some important distinction between first to file vs. first to invent that plays a role there. There's also a thing called "prior art" which allows you to invalidate a patent later if you can show that someone else did it first. However, the way these things usually turn out is more complicated: it's more likely that somebody will take your GPLv2 code, make some minor improvement to it or reapply it to a slightly different use case, and then somehow convince a patent office (which are mostly run by laymen who don't care) that this change is significant enough to be worth its own patent. If they can get that patent granted, they can then prevent anyone (including you) from using that improvement or applying your code to that separate use case, even if you came up with it independently. (Their code would still have to be released under the GPL because copyright and patents are two completely orthogonal things, but you wouldn't be allowed to use that "open-source" code without violating their patent.) For that reason, it's generally a good idea to use open source licenses with explicit patent clauses to prevent this shit, like the GPLv3 or the Apache license.  
Adding onto this, GNU has sued corporations in the past for failing to adhere to the GNU Public License, primarily because those companies took the code did things similar to what Google is doing. Just note that GPLv3 is the version that has the anti-patent provisions.  
Yes. Licenses are not patents.   
Doesn't matter.  Patents have to be novel.  If you can prove that someone else came up with it first, then they can't patent it.  
 If you can prove that someone else came up with it first and publicly documented it, then they can't patent it.  FTFY Patents are used to incentivise public documentation of trade secrets, to avoid them dying with the inventor. If the prior art isn't publicly documented, then it's irrelevant.  
Wrong, they have a very real possibility of patenting it.  You can then use your proof combined with 6 figures in lawyer fee to attempt to invalidate their patent.  
I thought proof in the public space invalidates the claim  
It does. Lawyers and court are also expensive for the average joe, not so much for Google  
True  
Isn't this just proof the whole patent system is broken and needs destroying? We could easily share ideas without worrying about anyone stealing. We all benefit more from collaboration instead   
The alternative is to instead have everything be guarded as a trade secret, which would slow down progress immensely. With patents, the inventor gets some protection, in exchange for disclosure that anyone else can build on and improve.  
Except that you can't build and improve on something that you're not allowed to use because someone else has a patent. Trade secrets are still a thing anyway. Nobody patents shit that really gives them a big competitive advantage and can reasonably be kept secret today. The patent system is outdated and needs to either get a major overhaul or just be abolished. FWIW I think all the claims that without patents nobody would invent anything anymore are bullshit FUD. These days, first-to-market is plenty of incentive in and off itself.  
 Except that you can't build and improve on something that you're not allowed to use because someone else has a patent.  Patents expire and when they do they are free for anyone to use. That's the whole point of patents. In theory they're a fantastic idea. In current practice, not so much, but the answer is to reform patents not abandon them.  
you can can use but you have to pay.  
 Trade secrets are still a thing anyway. Nobody patents shit that really gives them a big competitive advantage and can reasonably be kept secret today.  Catalysts in the chemical industry are one major example of this. Catalysis still has an embarrassingly large component of black magic. We've come a long way in advancing our knowledge of how many catalysts work, we have good ways of examining the chemistry at metal surfaces and even nanoparticles, but in practice, a lot of catalytic discoveries happen by chance in an industrial lab. Academics tend to take the approach of "We believe this catalyst will work better because it has properties X, Y, and Z," and are hesitant to test catalysts for which they can't justify or explain their behavior. Industry, on the other hand, tends to be "We're pretty sure this will work because it has property X, but really we already know that if we sprinkle in a bit of metals A, B, C, and a dash of D, we'll get some okay results." If you noticed, the industry example I gave would have a 4-metal system. 3-metal systems are already a complete nightmare to characterize, so it becomes extremely difficult to figure out how industry catalysts work. Not only that, but these catalysts are huge trade secrets. A lot of work (and money) goes into doing everything they can to prevent their secret catalysts from contaminating the final product, because they don't want to accidentally sell a sample of their catalyst to another company. And these aren't usually wonder-catalysts that have the potential to drastically change the world, usually they're catalysts that just give a 1-2% increase in efficiency to the process. The chemical industry, though, operates at such a scale that the 1-2% might translate to millions in profits, which is huge for any company. So then we get to the current situation, where there's a bit of a disconnect between Academics and Industry. Academics try to understand and slowly proceed with their catalysts, and Industry throws metals together based on what's empirically worked. Neither sectors share data with one another (primarily because Industry is paranoid about their catalysts), although some level of collaboration exists between the two.  
There's no reason to believe this is true, tho. Technology advanced just fine before patents existed. They do not exist to encourage innovation, but to protect profits.  
 I could imagine that Google just decided to try as hard as possible to patent whatever the fuck they can about this important new technology...  Apple does that too. There's a website that watches apple patents, even. I mean it sounds evil or bad... but if the system is broke, use it to your advantage, it's not your responsibility to fix it.  
I think corporate giants like Google and Apple do in fact have a responsibility to fix it.   
Yeah, that's exactly what patent laws are made for.  "Fixing it".   Fix it for your corporate buddies so they can have legal monopolies!  Intellectual property does not exist and defenders or it are confused or evil IMO.    
 Intellectual property does not exist and defenders or it are confused or evil IMO.  So you're also against any kind of software license? I think that licenses are greatly important to free software, and anyone who is against them is either confused or evil.

That's more an indictment of capitalism than of the prior poster's statement, imo.  
Entire premise of why people hate capitalism* As good as capitalism is, the self interest part of it needs to roll back.  
For a patent to be granted, the invention needs to have not been publicly disclosed before the patent is filed. For example, no one can just go around patenting academic papers. Edit: /u/ExMuslimScientist said essentially the same thing.   
Yeah, not sure why folks don't do that. Patent it. If you wanna be generous, license it freely. If you want money, you got that too.  Never a reason not to patent.   
When I first started programming, Google was all about open source and Microsoft was all closed and proprietary. Now, it‚Äôs the opposite.  I don‚Äôt think this new strategy Google is putting in place is going to end well.  
It worked for Microsoft though. People forget.  
It worked in the short term. If it was still working, they wouldn't have changed it. These days, the talented developers are more likely to be working on linux-based OS's and languages. Without changing, they would be Oracle.  
You think the money comes from open source stuff lol? MS is doing all its $$$ with enterprise which as of today is mostly closed source.  
No, the money is in enterprise, and Microsoft is quickly learning that the current enterprise requirements typically include Linux support. If Microsoft says that RHEL containers are not supported, or that MSSQL doesn't work with python, well then Microsoft is just off the table because Amazon does provide that stuff. All the big companies have known for a long time that you encourage the college students to use your stuff and they'll take it to their job where it becomes a standard. Open source does that with Linux, and it's free. It's an excellent platform to learn on, with way better support than anything believe when considering things with a budget of zero. Because of that it's making its way into enterprise where all the money is, and nobody is making money without supporting it.  
Not all but a significant amount. Especially after their volume licensing changes since they started billing per core instead of per license üôÑ.  Disregard my comment below, I misread the OSE licensing documentation :(  
for office applications yes but they are moving over to hosted cloud systems and most of the money is the office 365 license which is part of the cloud azure system. But for operating systems windows is not even the bulk of their profit anymore.  
I think you misunderstand the positives/negatives of open source. Multi-billion dollar ips are always black box whereas usefu tools are usually open sourced so they are less expensive to maintian. Its why things like kubernetes is open sourced but google search isnt  
Well i use to really like google as a company, and now I view them on par with every other shit IT company.   At least in my view, google has fallen a long ways in  a really short time.     
And Apple. And IBM. Just ask Wozniak and Kildall respectively. lol  
It works for Microsoft in the pre cloud era. Today‚Äôs ‚Äúit‚Äôs packages all the way‚Äù environment is vastly different  
 I don‚Äôt think this new strategy Google is putting in place is going to end well.  It sure made MS a shitload of money.  
But they're making more money now than ever

 When I first started programming, Google was all about open source and Microsoft was all closed and proprietary. Now, it‚Äôs the opposite.  That's cute considering Microsoft still sues and threatens companies for using Linux and Android with expired, obsolete and prior art ridden patents. http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=2011111122291296  https://www.zdnet.com/article/m-cam-casts-doubts-on-microsofts-android-patent-portfolio/  https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-one-thing-microsoft-needs-to-do-to-gain-real-open-source-trust/   
I don't like the concept of a patent in software in general.  It feels for me like you want to patent a book story...   
There is a huge difference in software patents between the US and Europe. In Europe patenting software is almost impossible.  
As it should be.   
It's not as clear-cut. While I agree that the EU has the better laws, corporation can easily file in both areas (USA and EU) and benefit in these three cases:  Patent grant in both areas Patent grant in area 1 Patent grant in area 2  That gives them way too much control over areas e. g. market exclusion that can still work. Market exclusion should be ripped out from patent grants altogether. If you have a patent, then use it; or others can use it. Monetary compensation could still be used but has to be modest rather than exclusive. The best would be for no patents altogether but it's a bit difficult to revolutionize the world in one day. So the second best is to pull the teeth from this monster. Of course Google could also stop being Evil but we all know that will never happen. They even take pride in Evil these days; it's like their new meme "haha today we sniped 5000 via drone AI haha".  
Yeah the problem here is the huge flaws the IP legal system has in the US. This shit will keep happening until we fix the system for modern technology.  
You can't compare the two just because they're both written. A book doesn't do anything. There are reasons for patenting software that don't apply to a story.  
Not very good ones. Your innovations are already covered by copyright, so long as you keep them close to the chest. Now we have a framework for patenting math.  
Unless I'm mistaken, copyright doesn't offer the same protections that a patent does. Most software probably doesn't need to be patented. Some of it does.  Taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patent_debate#Arguments_for_patentability  Patents protect functionality. Copyright on the other hand only protects expression. Substantial modification to an original work, even if it performs the same function, would not be prevented by copyright. To prove copyright infringement also requires the additional hurdle of proving copying which is not necessary for patent infringement. Copyright law protects unique expressions, while patent law protects inventions, which in the case of software, are algorithms; copyright cannot protect a novel means of accomplishing a function, merely the syntax of one such means.[8]   
Indeed. Copyright covers your code. And that's my point: you didn't invent the math you figured out how to use. You just figured out how to use it. The math already worked. Einstein was a patent clerk. If you could patent math, his estate would have collected billions in royalties from physics labs around the globe!  
No, it is pretty much the same as patenting the general plot of a book. Copyright covers the verbatim text of the book, just as it does for the implementation of software. The US is the only place idiotic enough to allow software patents.  
Parents are all that's in the way from small tech companies being beaten to market immediately by big ones, it's the cost of innovation. Now I believe the whole system needs to be revamped in some way, but it's certainly better than nothing.  
This is the best tl;dr I could make, original reduced by 93%. (I'm a bot)   A Google spokesperson told Ars that Duda came up with a theoretical concept that isn't directly patentable, while Google's lawyers are seeking to patent a specific application of that theory that reflects additional work by Google's engineers. Over the last couple of months, we've repeatedly asked Google to put us in touch with a Google technology expert who can explain exactly what Google invented and how it goes beyond Duda's own work. Google never made someone like that available to us, so we can't explain how Google distinguishes its own invention from Duda's original work.

good bot Edit: A bit off topic but i wanted to know how this and all the other bots work because I am quite impressed by how useful and innovative some bots are. Thank You.  
In their FAQ section they say in layman‚Äôs how the bot works  
A bit of software that someone wrote and didn't patent because it wasn't directly patentable, but then Reddit took it and patented a specific application of it.  
Well, if you can program look up the praw python library. I wrote a bot once and well it's a no-brainer accomplish something basic  but cool with it.

Step one, remove pledge to not be evil from their site, step two, be evil. UPDATE: Fake news! They still pledge to not be evil. https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/8q3kp8/inventor_says_google_is_patenting_work_he_put_in/e0gf19o  
Go here, Ctrl+F, type "don't be evil". I don't understand how this complete fabrication still gets traction -- they removed it from the preface, left it in the conclusion, every blog on the internet implied that it was removed completely, and everyone just bought it  
Well they're kinda being evil  
What was once all of Google became Alphabet at some point (with Google as a subset), and Alphabet has no such pledge. Not saying the people are right about Google removing "don't be evil," but that's likely where the misconception arises (and to be fair, it was real bad optics for Alphabet to not retain "don't be evil")  
Google changing their CoC was much later. And they did remove some mentions of "don't be evil", but it's clearly still there. People act like Google decided to go full supervillain but first they had to update the code of conduct to allow it

Petition to change the name of that Jarek guy to Jared  
His name is actually Jaros≈Çaw. "Jarek" is to "Jaros≈Çaw" what "Bob" is to "Robert". Yeah, I forgot a word.  
Bob is short for Bobert  
I just read the title, then the word "compression" in the article, and my mind immediately turned to Silicon Valley  
But Hooli had the patent the whole time...  
Patenting software doesn't make sense. Copyrighting it, however, does. Anyway, this just goes to show how much patents prove a lack of novelty.  
It's idiotic. My company is always writing patents for things that we haven't even necessarily done or made work. There's just this idiotic patent quota given to us. Management is incompetent.  
The old image of somebody presenting a working prototype to the patent office is novel. Don't even need to actual working prototype or something that could ever work for that matter.  
The one exception to that is the patent office requires a working prototype before they will issue a patent for a perpetual motion machine.  
Copyrighting the code makes sense but patenting the software‚Äôs applications m, etc. does make sense. It‚Äôs pretty consistent with the policies behind the patent system.   
America: Freedom to get fucked by somebody with more money than you.  
I find it interesting that the "inventor" on the patent is Alex Converse, who also works on VLC and FFmpeg.  
This is why having a license on your shit is so important.  Because if someone steals your shit, suddenly, they have to fight a case why they eirther have to remove your code immediatelly, or their product becomes free.   
Everyone take a breath and read the article. Google have recognized that Duda invented the theoretical foundations of ANS. What they are patenting is a specific implementation, which is exactly what parents are for.  Duda claims that he suggested this implementation to Google engineers via email. That is the crux of the dispute, meaning this isn't a broader question about software patents. On the topic though, software patents are the nukes of the software world. No one particularly likes them, but they have to maintain an arsenal of them for deterrence reasons. This disincentives large firms from suing one another non-stop, since it would carry a near-certain counter-suit. If you don't like software patents, you can go yell at the USPTO. Google, Facebook, Apple, et al. are acting rationally within the system that exists by trying to patent everything they can.   
The email conversation, available on Google groups, is linked to in the article: https://groups.google.com/a/webmproject.org/forum/#!topic/codec-devel/idezdUoV1yY  
The 'specific application' that Google have 'invented' amounts to 'use ANS to compress video'. That is a trivially obvious application of ANS, and one that was specifically proposed by Jarek already.  If you invent a new compression method then deciding to use it in places that other compression methods are already being used is not a novel invention. Otherwise what stops me from patenting 'use ANS to compress text files', or 'use ANS to compress my parent's tax return' or 'use ANS to compress binaries of compression applications'? Patents are supposed to be non-obvious to a skilled person.  Given ANS itself has prior art, Google's argument for their video patent is nonsense and they should be ashamed of themselves. Rather than engaging in MAD, Google and other technology companies should be using their lobbying power to persuade legislators to reform the system to ensure that software is not patentable.  
You‚Äôre completely right, and this is why this will be rejected until Google can amend the claims to encompass something which is novel and inventive, which the claims currently definitely are not.  I agree Google should be ashamed to file an application like this but the point in doing so is to get the patent office to find the relevant prior art so they can narrow the claims to fit within the largest gap they can find. It‚Äôs not fun seeing how the sausage is made and the game of narrowing patents is usually pretty unsatisfactory for everyone.   
 No one particularly likes them, but they have to maintain an arsenal of them for deterrence reasons Google, Facebook, Apple, et al. are acting rationally within the system  No, if they really hated software patents, they would lobby to end the patentability of software. They are doing nothing of the sort, therefore they are fine with things the way they are.  
Xiph has another perspective on this, see this: https://xiphmont.dreamwidth.org/84214.html, which links to another Reddit thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/6h08z5/google_is_currently_trying_to_patent_video/ So, I think we need to hold our horses on this one  
That is a no-statement. Plus, aside from the immature potty mouth language used there, they do not address the issue of patent-exclusion. At the least Jarek Duda always said from day 1 to make it public domain.  
I‚Äôm not terribly surprised the dude who took steps to ensure the algorithm and simple applications of it remain in the public domain is upset that one of the largest software companies in the world is attempting to patent an application suggested by said dude. Hm.  
He's still fighting them!? I used ANS in my game's netcode 3 years ago. How does Google patent something I used 3 years ago?

Fucking patents.  
[deleted]  
Yes, but Google claims that they "are seeking to patent a specific application of that theory that reflects additional work by Google's engineers."  
This is exactly why you want a patent; to keep control of your inventions. What you do with the patent is up to you.  
Patents are like MAD in nuclear weapons. Except we could invalidate them overnight with a change in law and remove the threat immediately. No non-trivial software is safe from patent infringement, software patents are a threat to the whole industry and should be abolished.  
Didn't Elon Musk do that with some of his EV technology? And people were outraged that he didn't just public domain it instead.  
His patents came with absurd terms  
He did public domain a bunch of those technologies  
Kind of like companies that try to patent genes eg Myriad Genetics patenting the BRCA gene  - aside from the issue of wether nature should be ‚Äòowned‚Äô like this, there is the fact that the University of Utah had actually isolated the gene, not Myriad - they had only licensed it from the university.    
Patents are nothing more than the states way to sell market control.

It's worth pointing out earlier this year Tiktok got caught using a voice synth library they didn't have a license for either https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701167/bev-standing-tiktok-lawsuit-settles-text-to-speech-voice  
Is it that really annoying one that is spammed constantly?  
https://youtu.be/QzycPRzf8_A It's the one from before the current one, the new one is the one that has trouble saying "hhhhhhh" Edit: I should have included an example of what I was talking about https://youtube.com/shorts/k1NIBWKCWxw  
So the new one is more accurate? Because that's not a word  
I think the issue is less that it says "aych aych aych aych" and more that after like five letters it descends into weird moaning and then messes up all the normal words that come after it. It does not do this with other letters.  
huehuehue so funey  
It doesn't mean it can't be pronounced  
I have to admit. Never used tiktok. Was it the billion dollar advertising that made them so popular?  Is china paying people to upload stuff? Or is it just a hamster bar for sugar? All of these are horrible.  
Pretty sure consensus was that Vine dropped the bag letting go of mobile friendly, short burst videos. Snapchat focused too much on chatting than snapping. So TikTok made content delivery easy from the moment you're in and whenever you search to an audience that kinda wanted it.  
TikTok has one of the BEST recommendation algorithms on the market. Purely speaking from a CS perspective.  
Yep. It's pretty wild how fast it starts recommending shit that you're actually interested in. I downloaded it to try out during the pandemic, after about three hours I was getting a feed basically entirely curated to me. I prompted deleted the app. I don't need to doomscroll TikTok for three hours a night as it progressively learns me better and better.

Incidentally, while the lawsuit was still active, Bev Standing did have legal standing.  
HA!  
They're okay with it. They'll make more money than the fines.  
Which is exactly the problem with our legal system. Many laws don't apply to the rich, because they can just continue to pay the fines and never have a dent in their wallet. It's like if you were fined a penny for stealing. You'd be like "woah! I just paid a penny for a loaf of bread instead of the normal price! Might as well just keep stealing it!"  
Exactly, fines are only relevant to the poor. Which is why they're so popular a means of deterrence, and why the rich and powerful try to convince those less rich and powerful that they're a good idea (and so why they're so popular)

You have been banned from r/ Sino.  
print('-9999 social credits.')  
Can a FOSS Dev sue tiktok? From what ive seen companies/individuals usually sue for loss/stolen revenue.  
You still have lost revenue. Theoretically a licensing agreement outside the FOSS license has a value. So basically you are suing for reasonable valuation on what licensing would have been.  
Depending on the license, the FSF will sue on behalf of the devs  
it's the chinese way  
Remember when someone figured out that tiktok was also scalping a lot more data off people's devices than what they said they were essentially making tiktok classified as spyware? Unless this has been debunked.  Every time I post this it gets downvoted.  
There's been some reporting on that but it can be hard to determine what's real and what's hyperbole, and some share of the classic "well it's doing A, B, and C... but so are things like the Reddit app and Facebook app" / where do you draw the line between shady and a virus At the least I don't think they were ever caught using like honest to god like EternalBlue style exploits or anything. But I'm certainly not an expert! Since I don't live in China I kind of am just hoping they don't care about what they might find out about me, but also I don't post on the app and never give it permissions on my phone https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/13/tiktok-privacy/ https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/apps/a31260575/tik-tok-spying/  
So if I'm understanding the GPLv2 license properly. In order for TikTok to be compliant, they must release their source code publicly?  
Yep. With LGPL you could avoid this by bundling the LGPL code into an open-source library, and then linking against that library in your closed-source project. But under GPLv2 this is prohibited, so they would have to open source their entire app.  
Sexy Cyborg (u/sexycyborg) really did a good one on one such issue where she went personally to a company and had them give her the source code. The BS chinese company said they will only give the source code in a pendrive to someone who goes to their office in Shenzen, when the international community asked them to do so (since they were claiming to be compliant) So someone reached out to Sexy Cyborg and she did all the foot work in getting the source code lol. She is a badass.  
She's definitely an inspiration in the hacker space.  
oh I never saw the followup video, did they actually give her the source code? That's hilarious  
Not only that the company actually did a 180 and started publishing it online which should honestly be applauded for the change of mind.  
Holy shit I haven't heard that name in ages. Last I heard was when Vice wrote a slander article on her years ago. I'm really glad she's still around and as badass as ever.  
SC is based beyond belief  
Slander for what?  
You cannot use LGPL libraries for iOS/Android apps as the end user isn‚Äôt able to swap out the LGPL libraries even if you dynamically link to them.  
Oh that's interesting. On Android wouldn't it be technically possible? You could have it not supported in the main app store version, but provide an APK that uses intents to allow users who really want to to hook their own streaming app in.  
It is technically possible on iOS as well, but you don‚Äôt have ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù because you can‚Äôt sign and run the modified application on your phone. Self signing doesn‚Äôt seem to count for whatever reason either.  
I don't understand your point, why would end user swap anything in a app? LGPL license allows dynamic linking regardless of platform  
LGPL doesn‚Äôt require dynamic linking. It requires the end user being able to swap out the parts of the program that is licensed with LGPL. Which you cannot do on mobile. Dynamic linking is just a convenient way to do it on desktop.  
But who will enforce this?  
In theory, OBS. It's their IP, so they should have a case. In practice, they may not have the resources to do so, and the international nature of this case would complicate things.  
The owner of the intellectual property could do that, possibly with help from entities like the EFF.  A similar case is OpenWRT which was forked when Linksys had to release the source code for their routers. Edit: Thanks for the correction  
In practice, it's almost impossible to sue a Chinese company for violating open source licenses. Several Chinese companies are using GPL based software, without releasing their source code and nobody is able to stop them.  
They either have to release their source code (and license it as GPLv2) or change their code to invoke OBS as a separate process. OBS probably doesn't support seamlessly doing that. It's the combining of the two codebases that makes it noncompliant.  
The GPL copyleft doesn't trigger when you combine code in the same process, it triggers when you do so in the same "program"; the definition of such being more than a little murky legally speaking. But I imagine that a judge would consider a process-separated OBS to be the same program for the purposes of the GPL. After all, there are plenty of ways for multiple processes to act as a single program (otherwise Google Chrome would have never gotten off of the ground).  
Worth noting Apple seem to take this interpretation. Clang exists because their lawyers suggested that the 'linking' issue was merely technical and a judge would likely see out of process as part of the same work.  
Apple's lawyers take this interpretation because it's what RMS told Steve Jobs way back in the early days of NeXT. It's worth noting, however, that Apple did not create LLVM/Clang purely to get out of needing to comply with the GPL copyleft. The original plan was to modernize GCC and get it upstreamed; they e-mailed RMS about it, but the e-mail got lost in his inbox because he insists on being offline for huge stretches of time.  
The GPL triggers when you create a derivative work, this is inherent to the words "based on" in the license. Traditionally, static and dynamic linking are said to create derivative works. Some other interactions are a little hazier. But all tests aside, this particular tool is just OBS with a few UI tweaks, so... It's pretty clearly a derivative work on its face. I am not your attorney and this is not legal advice.  
 Traditionally, static and dynamic linking are said to create derivative works.  That's kind of interesting to me. As a software engineer I might bring in a third-party library and just encapsulate it without actually extending it. So, according to this, the mere fact of having it as a dependency means my work would be derivative which doesn't quite sit right with me as there could be tons of other stuff that has zero to do with the specific library. Oh and I don't even want to think about transient  dependencies.  
Right, I should have said if it's another program that's invoked, like Audacity using ffmpeg if you install ffmpeg separately.  
[deleted]  
Not publicly, no. That's a common misconception with GPL. They must give everyone a reasonable path to requesting and receiving source, but they themselves don't have to make it public.  
To be compliant, their source must be licensed as GPL. So the first person to request and receive it can then distribute it freely.  
To get the source code all you have to do is drop by our office in China!  
[deleted]  
oh boi they aren't doing that lmao all that data mining software will have to released lmao  
They would only have to release the source code to whatever app makes use of this library - I.e: this fork of OBS. In which their meaningful contributions are ... a face lift? It's kinda like when you hear that some big wig company has "open sourced" their app. They've open sourced it alright. They've open sourced the Android/iOS client for it, that is. Just a bunch of frontend components. The real secret sauce (their backend code) is never leaving the coop.

He's got a good point guys!  
Except, in this case licence (GPL V2) can't be bought. So it seems more like why bother with rules when you can ignore them.  
Just because something is under GPL, doesn't mean it can't be sold/bought. If it's your code you can make a GPL version freely available and sell it under a different license. If you accepted community contributions or are using other gpl libraries, then this becomes challenging - I didn't look it up for this library so I'm just speaking generally.  
Who's going to enforce gpl anyways?

I'd argue it's part of their culture. They don't recognize piracy/duplication the same way we do.  it's similar to how some cultures don't understand standing in line / queueing  the same we we do, so everyone needs to stand basically touching each other so others don't cut in line.  
It got Huawei in trouble years ago when they were caught using stolen Cisco IOS source code. They tried to claim it was acceptable because they downloaded it from a random FTP site.  
I'm not the one who stole the software, I just downloaded it!  
Would agree that this is largely a cultural difference. However, I believe writing it off as a cultural oversight becomes a little muddied as soon as you release an app for international use.  
[deleted]  
 I'd argue it's part of their culture. They don't recognize piracy/duplication the same way we do.  "The Hardware Hacker" by Bunnie Huang dives into this at a manufacturing level pretty well. From the section "Part 2 thinking differently: intellectual property in china":  One of the most insightful lean engineering practices enabling the creation of complex systems on a shoestring budget is the shanzhai method for sharing IP. I‚Äôll explore this by comparing and contrasting the Western notion of open source with the shanzhai method, which I refer to as gongkai. In Western law, open source has a formal definition, referring specifically to an IP sharing system governed by an explicit license to share. This license is granted by the copyright holder, often with significant commercial restrictions. Open source advocates vigorously defend this notion and are quick to dis-avow any IP that doesn‚Äôt explicitly use an approved license. In gongkai, if you can obtain a copy of the blueprints, you can use them as you please; it doesn‚Äôt matter who made them. Yet people still share their ideas because the blueprints act as an advertisement. Blueprints often refer explicitly to certain chips or contain contact information for the firm that drew them. The creators hope circulating their blueprints will bring business to their factory when people order parts or sub-assemblies referenced within, or when people call their firm to improve or customize the design. In other cases, blueprints are traded. For example, there are bulletin board exchanges where before you download a blueprint, you must contribute one of your own.   
 gongkai  so this is MIT license, no?  
Yep. I was about to link a couple of his blog posts, maybe here is as good a place as any:  https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?page_id=3107 https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=4297   
Yup, all one needs to do is look at how shameless huawei and oppo rip off Apple in just about every aspect of their wearables, interfaces and marketing materials. (Samsung does it as well in certain spots but overall they have found their own identity)  
It's a culture created by the CCP. It's okay to do things that break international law as long as we benefit. We don't need to worry about international consequences because we're too big and powerful.  In 2006 there was a phone called the Raspberry which was a complete ripoff of the BlackBerry, barely even made the effort to change the name. Copying was done all the time because there were no consequences for copying things and selling knock-offs domestically. Hell the original was probably made in China anyways so you could just product more, rebrand the extras and cut the original creator out. Since they're not getting a cut of the Raspberry batch, you can even lower the price and completely undercut blackberry domestically. Everything is made and sold domestically, infrastructure and jobs are created; all this looks great to the CCP. And with the size of the Chinese economy alone, a company may never need to go international. It's a just a bonus source of new markets if you can, like it was for TikTok. Who oopsidentally mooched something perhaps they shouldn't have. But this was, if not encouraged, not really discouraged by the CCP. They don't play nice. Not even with their own people.  
Chinese companies are like the Goa'uld; everything they possess, the knowledge they have, is all stolen.  
They don't want to spend the money on development. Happens all the time. Cisco does the same shit with Jabber and Finesse. Just half assed apps.  
What's the history with Jabber and Finesse?  
Cisco is now selling jabber as if they made it, when XMPP and Jabber have been around for 20 damn years or more. They just repackage it and claim it‚Äôs ‚Äúnew‚Äù and ‚Äúinnovative ‚Äú  
XMPP is an open protocol. And according to Wikipedia, Cisco acquired an implementation called Jabber XCP in 2008. I vaguely recall Trillium interacting with AOL IM and Jabber users back in the day. So I think you're wrong about Jabber. It's like accusing someone of stealing SMTP because they sell an email client. What's the deal with Finesse?  
That's what open-source is for. Forking isn't the issue here, it's actually the point. The issue is not releasing the code, and not even mentioning where the code comes from.  
Because they are a billion dollar company. Releasing tech is just a case of ship it however you can, then work it out later. Why wait 6-9months to build tech, and invest time/people into a project that you have no idea if users will even aodpt it, when you can hack it together and release it today using your stack of money to keep obstructions at a distance.  
To be fair, most Chinese companies follow this model. It is the cheapest way to produce a product if you can copy the source/development from somebody else and just need to apply it.   This is how most of their IT giants were born and this is what they will keep doing. Sorry but you really should not be surprised. They might be a billion-dollar company, but they still do what is most profitable to them.  
You can already post video and audio on their app, I don't know much about streaming and how the frontend and backend works but logic dictates that tiktok should have it easy at building their own streaming app. Nothing against taking code from others but this isn't MIT or BSD license, you have to give back something they haven't done and will not do.  
Didn‚Äôt want to take the time it takes to get it to market using their original code I‚Äôm sure.  
Product wanted something and rather than doing a design doc and putting an entire team working on streaming software or buying a saas streaming api some engineer just said fuck it there‚Äôs an open source library on GitHub without checking the license  
You don't build a billion dollar company by writing checks...  
They've got a billion reasons

Stop using Tiktok.  Its poison.  
I'm convinced that TikTok is a Chinese tool of subversion. Look at the amount of damage that can be done with certain posts encouraging kids to cause mayhem. It's a great way to disrupt a society. War isn't only waged with bullets and bombs.  
lmao the same could be said for Youtube pal. Also, Tiktok is full of all sorts of content, e.g. educational discussion relating to space, geology, biology, etc, economic and political discussions, exercise, hiking, biking, crafting, welding, sewing, wood working, etc.  
 lmao the same could be said for Youtube pal.  I never said they weren't. Social media in general has been weaponized. It doesn't have to even be done in coordination with them. Given that TikTok is Chinese and you don't do shit in China without the CCP's hand up your ass, I have no problem believing that China, or any other enemy of the US, is using it as a weapon.  
so... Arab Spring but in the West?  
Right along with Reddit, Instagram, YouTube and Facebook. They are all just as bad. Actually, Instagram is absolutely worse.  
There is no way that Instagram is worse than tiktok. No chance at all  
In the other subthread you focus on addictiveness (although you mostly use anecdotal evidence, just because you're not addicted to IG doesn't mean others aren't). But you have to look at it from mental impact angle. Instagrams entire purpose in the teen world is posting content that make your life look better than it is, and looking at other people's (fake) amazing life. All it does is make teenagers insecure and depressed. It's ruining the mental health of all the teens worldwide. TikTok's content is very different from instagram. There's far less content focused on people showing off their beauty/lifestyle, and a lot more focus on funny, interesting or useful content. It's less selfies and more funny shit that happened. It's less thirst trap and more life hack and tips.  
A quick Google and the first link for me seems to support my opinion  https://techjury.net/blog/time-spent-on-social-media/#gref Tiktok users spend on average 50% more time on the app daily than Instagram users 45min vs 30min numbers slightly rounded. The reason I dislike tiktok more than Instagram is that content is encouraged by the algorithm to be repetitive, using the same sounds to do the same thing, even the same content multiple times.  I honestly dont know that I can say that tiktok isnt damaging for a teens mental health either.  
Yeah, stop using everything, but not Reddit, Reddit is the best!  
it has porn  
Until they IPO soon  
It's crazy how addictive it is. The feed is tailored so well, crazy  
The person who designed the algorithm that feeds your page must be a genius. I don't think there is a website that knows what you wanna watch as well as tiktok.  
YouTube has been hitting the mark for me lately also. The real magic is figuring out how to classify new content to bump that up against your watch history.  
I don't feel like some understand the GPLv2 license. TikTok forking OBS is not the problem, the problem is that any fork of a strong GPLv2 license, also falls under the GPLv2 license, and must be open as such.  If TikTok simply openly shared this fork on say Git, they wouldn't be doing anything wrong. Taking something under GPLv2 and then close sourcing it, is the problem.  
So you're saying a Chinese owned tech company is blatantly violating copyrights?  I'm shocked.   SHOCKED I SAY!  
Illegal in the USA yeah probably. Illegal in china? Different matter.... Good luck trying to push the juristiction enforcement......  
What? That‚Äôs not an issue.  Illegally using the software means OBS can get it removed from every platform which would be pretty significant.  
Good point. If they can do that, it might be relatively "easy" and not cost that much compared to a actual lawsuit.  
Are the OBS devs based enough to do that?  
They already gave shit to another streaming company rebranding their shit, so yes.  
yeah that one tweet had everyone shakin'  
[deleted]  
"Based" is the worst word to have been rebranded in my lifetime.  
Based where? In the US?  
TikTok has assets in the US, and operates their app there. Enforcement is not an issue at all.  
If it's distributed through the iOS app store, then they should be worried. The strategy will probably be to get Apple to region-block it because they can't host / facilitate the use of stolen IP  
China is party to the Berne convention so yes, nominally illegal in China. Not that the CCP would give a shit.  
I think the big thing would be that they're in violation of the license, so they are in violation of a contract.  
They can remove it in the US tho.  
It appears that their installer downloads OBS from the official site, installs it, and then installs their software that works with it. They haven't forked OBS, or modified it, if that's the case, they've simply written a proprietary application that automates OBS. If they're using OBS shared libraries then perhaps they're violating the GPL (but wouldn't be violating the LGPL - wonder how those libraries are licensed?). What they're doing, though, appears to be a more complex example of something like my Logitch mouse software pausing and playing VLC media player when I hit a mouse button. Apparently there is OBS source present in their software and the GPL doesn't give them the right to use that source without distributing the source of their own software. Sorry for the confusion.  
Would be interesting to see if they roll a new non-OBS version to avoid GPL scrutiny.  
is there evidence of this? because nobody is mentioning that the op's picture is very clearly just a directx runtime, and you can confirm by following the link yourself... like are yall just gullible as fuck or am i missing something? its not even downloading the binaries from an OBS server, it links directly to microsoft. wtf is this thread?  
Well reading through it, someone decompiled the software and found out it even has Game Capture from original OBS. The install script for DX is also from OBS, so they‚Äôre obviously using code from them. I guess that‚Äôs what you missed?  
An OBS developer has identified OBS binary code. There's a link to a Hacker News discussion about this in one of the top top-level comments here, but I'm too lazy to grab it.  
Sounds about right for TikTok  
Its of chinese make.  Literally everything they build is a copy of someone elses design.  
Take something successful and put your name on it. Highly immoral but profit is guaranteed.  
Scalpers, Amazon, ebay, etc.  Literally what everyone does.  Half american society is also just relabeled efforts of others.  
Unskilled devs? Or Lazy devs? Or you get what you pay for devs?  
This whole thread is poison.  
Whaaaaaaat? A Chinese company illegally using someone else‚Äôs product? Never heard that before....  
FINALLY. I can hide my shitty Udemy learning repositories and keep my actual products visible to people.  
THIS  
You could always use Gitlab or Bitbucket for that, no?   
[deleted]  
I really can't prefer Github over Gitlab. I only use Github when going public. The CI/CD and other features make me go for Gitlab all the way.  
[deleted]  
I‚Äôm actually most familiar with bitbucket. We use it at the office. But github is far more popular which is why I use it for my personal repos. I‚Äôve never used gitlab, I might check it out one day.  
[deleted]  
 I'm wondering if there's any reason to keep paying for an individual dev account.  I'm going to guess "no." I suspect Microsoft is taking this the way of other developer tools they own: "If you do the sort of work that can make real money with our tools, we want our cut. Otherwise, do whatever you want."  
I can see the logic behind that, and seems quite fair IMO.   
It's been used by lots of very high end pricey software like CGI in a way. lack of private repos was one of the reason I used bitbucket.. maybe they want to take their market share too.  
I imagine this is a response to GitLab, their real competition. Bitbucket is not really a player anymore.  
We use bitbucket because of jira and pipelines.  
Back when I was in music production the hit software, Ableton Live, was ~$800 give or take for a full license. The community consensus was that if you are a hobbyist, pirate it. Once you start releasing music, gigging, etc. buy that license. Of course I planned ahead, I was gonna start gigging in a few months after I got a few more tracks out, so might as well just get that license now right? Well a month later I had decided to pursue a Masters in Electrical Engineering and I haven't touched the license since lmao.  
Github was too expensive for me for this very reason, now I can rest in peace. Unlimited (I have 80gb repos, game dev) and private? YES  
80GB is absolutely enormous for a git repo. You shouldn't be committing anything like media or binary files because each commit saves a copy of all the files needed for a checkout so that checking out a random commit is fast.  There is git lfs which allows you to track files in such a way that only a reference to that file is stored in every commit (unless that file changes), but even for game dev you should be storing large resources separately. EDIT: For clarification, each commit only stores the full file if the file has changed from the last commit. The difference between git and most other VCS systems is git doesn't store diffs (which means checking out a given commit can be slow if a file has to be constructed from a lot of diffs). It's still a good idea to restrict the content of git repos to source code (aka text files) as much as possible, because while rewriting a repo's history is possible, it's not the intended way git is supposed to work and can really mess up collaboration when suddenly people have the "same" repo but with different histories.  
[deleted]  
You can clean your history from time to time and remove the binary files from them (if they are changed). It'll save you a lot of space and cloning repo will be easier. But media files should not be on repo, use a cloud drive for those file and snapshot versions of those file if needed (look at unitypackage or equivalent for this). I tried once to keep a repo like that for a game with juniors. But  this solution is very short sighted, they don't learn good practices and i lose a lot of time administrating it.  
Yep. It's a great way to get people using their development platforms. I just wish they'd adopt a similar pricing model for their operating systems. Make Windows free for home/hobby use.  
They do seem to be leaning that way given how lax they still are with free upgrades even after it officially ended and non activation doesn't have the lock out period like older versions.  
I use windows every day and I paid like $100 about 5 years ago... not a bad deal imo  
People complain about having to pay for stuff, yet people also complain for companies using their data, can't have it both ways folks  
For most of the people who use Windows, they already consider it free since it comes with the computer.  
Or they pirate it.   
I‚Äôve been saying it for a long time and it hasn‚Äôt happened yet, but I think that‚Äôs coming too. The lynchpin that they haven‚Äôt worked out yet is making the Windows Store the go to place for software on the platform. There is far more money in running a store and then giving the OS away for free becomes a good financial decision. Until then, though, there is too much money left on the table if they stop charging for the OS.  I still think we‚Äôll see free Windows Home Edition become a thing eventually.   
It kind of is. You can't change the background and you get the "Activate Windows" watermark but other than that, it's 100% usable and you can download it from Window's website.  
I said this originally when Microsoft aquired GitHub and it still applies: Microsoft tools are shit if you are the average windows user who just needs to email and do basic computer work. However, their developer tools have always been significantly better. I've had good experiences with nearly all of the ones that I have worked with, even...visual studio.  
I second this. All of their frameworks and dev tools (that I have used) are well designed and documented and superior to their alternatives.   
It would be a stretch to call Azure well documented. Thank god for swedish Azure experts and their blogs or how to do half of what most people need to do on Azure would still be a mystery.  And no, I have no idea why it seems all of the useful blogs are swedish guys.   
Why "even" Visual Studio? I've only ever heard praise for it.  
Some people say its clunky and slow. I use it every day and love so not sure.  
I say it with a bit of sarcasm, mainly because the one time I did use it I was warned that it would be a nightmare but ended up being quite easy to learn and work with   
They also want dat data.  They could use it for recruiting, trend prediction, competitive analysis, etc. It‚Äôs a very valuable data mine.  They always said the next Microsoft will start in a garage. Google proved that. Now Microsoft wants to own the garage.  
According to the article:   Private repositories on free accounts are limited to three collaborators apiece.  If you want to work with more than 2 people, you'll have to pay.  
[deleted]  
I only recently got a personal bitbucket account because it was more convenient than storing git bundles on iCloud.  
I think bitbucket is not pleased, it was a strong differentiator  
Heck my private repos are only for myself, this is still nice.  
Does anyone know how this compares to Bitbucket and GitLab? Do they have higher collaborator caps for their free private repos?  
Gitlab have no limits on free private collaborators, their limit is harsh on CI free minutes though, which Github don't have. Free users also don't get things like full workflow on merge request approvals or epics or stats or code quality.  
Don't quote me on this but I think if your repo is public, there are no limits on CI free minutes.   
Bitbucket offers the same, unlimited free private repositories, but with 5 collaborators.  
Here's the official article: https://blog.github.com/2019-01-07-new-year-new-github/  
You the real MVP  
misscheduling a press release embargo time? Not good for thenextweb.com  
Huh? The article says it was posted 2 days ago, meaning the feature should have gone out yesterday according to the note at the top of the article.  How badly did they screw up this embargo scheduling stuff? EDIT: Techcrunch is reporting it now as of 4 minutes ago, so we can assume the announcement was supposed to go out at noon today: https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/github-free-users-now-get-unlimited-private-repositories/ EDIT2: Hah, no techcrunch has the embargo note too.  So somebody broke it, and tnw's timestamp is probably just screwed up I'd guess.  
The guy mistakenly scheduled the post for two days ago in Wordpress.  
Hah well that explains it. Sounds like he's getting chewed out for it too. EDIT: Hah, and he's telling people who criticize his carelessness to go fuck themselves.  I foresee a few deleted twitter threads in his future.  
When an embargo is broken, it's generally fair game for other publishers to do the same.  
Ah, another detail I missed. I went to the github blog etc, couldn't find any mention of it anywhere on their announcements etc. But the Techcrunch one also says: "Note: this story was scheduled for tomorrow, but due to a broken embargo, we decided to publish today. The feature will go live tomorrow."  
For the inevitable non-article-readers: private repositories by free accounts are limited to three collaborators each.  This is actually a pretty clever way for them to make their service more useful for personal projects by people who weren't going to pay anyway, while still charging for commercial use at scale.  
So this almost fits my needs for school projects, without worry someone will steal code cause issues.   
You can get GitHub Pro free as a student.  
This is really interesting. GitLab's biggest feature (in my opinion) was free private repos. This completely changes that.  
Gitlab also offers pretty good and free CI/CD for private repositories   
For free?  
Yes, completely free. Just like Travis or Drone. There is a bit of wait though, but no big deal.  
GitLab CI is nicer to configure and work with than Travis, especially if you're running everything in docker anyway.  
Isn't Travis only free for public repositories?   
Doesn‚Äôt GitHub Actions accomplish this now too?  
I don‚Äôt know, is it free for private repos?  
Yes, it is. (Source: I just tried it.)  
What about GitLab actually having a free software project that you can self-host? GitHub kind of requires you to, you know, keep using GitHub. Perfect fit for Microsoft.  
Running it on my little raspberry pi just for my own little repos. Pretty sweet.  
Isn't that a little slow? Last time I set up a VCS on my Pi it felt slower than just using GitHub.  
Yeah, it's slow, but it doesn't really affect me much, my needs are light. I like having the security of my own little device; I can push backups to another server of mine in case it melts down or something, but it's been solid for a couple of years now. Neat little $35 hack.  
Nah, Gitlab has many more interesting features and Github is very much behind already. Especially code reviews flow and integration with k8s is awesome.  
Microsoft influence?  
All those people who were saying Microsoft's ownership would be the death of GitHub and jumped ship to GitLab are now saying "huh, that's actually really cool!".   
I can understand the hate for their consumer products, but their developer product portfolio always seemed really solid.  
[deleted]  
Typescript as well   
 Developers! Developers! Developers! ...   
They even added subsystem Linux to Windows 10.  It's painfully easy to setup an ubuntu install  
yeah no complaints, Visual Studio is by far the best IDE i‚Äôve ever used. and they‚Äôre killin it with VS Code. C# is also the cleanest programming language in my books. their developer tooling is unmatched, gotta give them that.  
 I can understand the hate for their consumer products, but their developer product portfolio always seemed really solid.  Objections to Microsoft development tools aren't primarily about product quality, but about anti-competitive practices to privilege their product in the marketplace and extract rents from the industry. MS worked really hard historically to sabotage competing development tool vendors, with practices that might have been illegal under closer regulatory scrutiny.  
Google and Apple are easily 10x worse today than MS ever was.  It's kind of amazing how you never hear nearly as much vitriol for them, though... but MS? People are still harping on about shit they did 30 years ago.  
emBrAcE ExTeND eXTiNquiSh

Uh... nope, gitlab has free private repos too  
The hell are you talking about, GitLab had had that feature for years  
Guilty. I was very disappointed when Microsoft bought GitHub, but I‚Äôll be the first to admit I was dead wrong.   
I think so. They don't really need the money for this service anymore. TFS and Visual Studio have had interesting free/private options for over a decade now. It's like DEVELOPERS DEVELOPERS DEVELOPERS all over again.  
I'm on bitbucket because of the free private repos, what would be the additional benefit if i switched to github now?  
For me, the main thing is that I have public repos too not just private ones, and all my public repos are on GitHub. I can now just have everything under one service.  
In my experience, Bitbucket's website is so much slower, and the speed of networking with the repos was inconsistent. It wasn't worth the hassle of that, so I ended up paying for github private repos    
Not to mention it's down more often than it should.  
And the UI is godawful, especially on mobile (which for some people including me is important). It can also just downright hang and crash if your PR is large enough.  
Same, the only reason I have bitbucket is for private repos. I'd like to see pricing because we have more than three collaborators on internal private repos. Not sure I'll switch but it's tempting.   
Better tools. Most ci/cd software has GitHub integration.  
But GitLab has CI built-in. Free 2,000 minutes/month.  
starting tomorrow  
They should've included a timestamp on their update, because the article is timestamped 2 days ago and the update sounds like it was posted today.  
[deleted]  
Unlimited projects to start and never finish   
It's ok, I've been doing that with public repos already  
Exactly, at least now it won't be a public display of embarrassment   
That sweet sweet Microsoft money  
 Due to a scheduling error, we published this story one day before the embargo lifted. This feature isn‚Äôt live yet, but Github will formally unveil it tomorrow. When that happens, we‚Äôll update this post with a link to the official announcement.¬†  ‚Äã  
Great, goodbye dropbox 'Code' folder.  
*shutters*  
You honestly still did that? That reminds me of my high school days before discovering source control.   
You can still use local git for version control, and dropbox for synchronization  
I wonder what this means for Azure DevOps Repos.  
Azure DevOps will still be useful imo for setting up CI and CD pipelines and organizing backlogs. Once GitHub actions go live the pipeline advantage will definitely go away, but the backlog organization may still be useful for most team. Just my 2c.  
Well. Hopefully they will provide it still but use github as the infrastructure.   
Bad news for GitLab...  
At least GitLab still has its free self-hosted version going for it. BitBucket is the true loser here.  
I don't think Bitbucket will miss all those non paying users that much. Companies will keep using it because they're already using Jira.  
Sad but true.  
Also the CI/CD which is far better than bitbucket's which is slow as balls and horrible to use and navigate  
This, gitlab community edition and CI really just works. A little yaml file to create workflows and jobs really feels like magic.  
I personally use gitea, way easier to install, less features (I don't need too many) and a very similar ui.   
I'll be sticking with BitBucket personally. I prefer the de-emphasized (non-existent?) social features (these are private repos after all), and while I commend GitHub's efforts in presenting Git in a more user-friendly manner, I'm already familiar with the default, non-user-friendly interface, and I prefer how BitBucket more closely mirrors that rather than trying to abstract certain concepts.   
And why would that be? I was under impression GitLab blew GitHub out of the water when it came to features.  
I believe that unlimited free private repos are one of the most powerful features of GitLab for regular non-business users.  
BitBucket had this as well. There was no mass exodus when it was available. Microsoft purchase did more for GitLab than private repos, in my opinion, so this piece of news is not really worrisome for GitLab (which is more oriented to self-hosting I believe), but just good news for GitHub users.  
BitBucket is missing some critical features though. Like being able to search code.  
[deleted]  
Access management (even for the public hosted one) is a lot more nuanced in GitLab, for one. It has custom boards for issues and stuff too, I think?  
It's the built-in CI/CD. Also you can self-host it which doesn't really matter if to people using it as a GitHub replacement.  
What does GitLab have over GitHub?  
Better CI/CD tools?   
I think Microsoft considers that to be a part of App Center.  
GH Actions combined with third party CI/CD are amazing  
Code available under an OSS license, CI/CD, integration with current tools/infrastructure...  
It's open-source, has way better CI/CD and other infrastructure tools.  
GitHub Pages is not available for free private repos, so I'd still rock GitLab. Plus, the whole CI/CD that everyone has mentioned.  
Damn you Microsoft! Oh wait, what?  
[deleted]  
Only if you don't need more than 3 collaborators in your private repo  
So, probably yes.  
The power of free stuff Jun 4 2018: (microsoft acquisition) Github sucks! Jan 7 2019: (free repos) Github rocks!  
Press F to pay respects to Atlassian BitBucket  
otoh, they 'll be glad to offload all those freeloaders to microsoft  
Sweet, bye Bitbucket  
Thanks for pushing the price down though.  
Bye good riddance Atlassian  
That's somewhat funny considering how much hate towards Microsoft and "predictions" of GitHub's death was there when acquisition was announced  
Github has posted this to their blog now: https://blog.github.com/2019-01-07-new-year-new-github/  
[deleted]  
GitHub Pages is not available for free private repos.  
GitHub blog post : https://blog.github.com/2019-01-07-new-year-new-github/  
YES PLEASE! I have seriously been waiting for this for a very long time. Storing private projects, scripts, and snippets on a flash drive is quite annoying, especially when you lose them all the time. DropBox isn‚Äôt great with live editing and now if I don‚Äôt want my repository private, I can open it to the public for improvement or just to help someone else out. I work across several computers and just being able to log in to GitHub to cut and use parts of code that are private is amazing for me. I‚Äôm a game developer. I hope they follow through, because this is definitely big news for me. I have so many scripts and snippets that are for my eyes only that I use all the time, having them in one guaranteed place, I‚Äôm so excited.  
Remember when Microsoft bought them and everyone complained?  
Just saved $7/mo by switching back to GitHub  
From?  
No more gitlab/bitbucket for my private repos it seems  
Where's the official announcement?  
 Due to a scheduling error, we published this story one day before  the embargo lifted. This feature isn‚Äôt live yet, but Github will  formally unveil it tomorrow. When that happens, we‚Äôll update this post  with a link to the official announcement.¬†   
About fucking time! So sick of bitbucket for private repos, they refuse to fix half their short-comings.  
:) I guess I‚Äôm moving from BitBucket now   
The caveat being:  Private repositories on free accounts are limited to three collaborators apiece.   
And there goes my only reason to use bit bucket. Moving repositories tonight!  
Cool . After VS Code , github is another reason to love Microsoft  
This is going to sound super shill-y, but MS is one of the companies I‚Äôve been most excited to watch recently. Been fascinating watching the Ballmer/pre-Ballmer style get slowly replaced by the Nadella style. It looks like a pretty substantial philosophy shift has occurred.  
The Windows side of the house is still pretty head-up-nether-regions.  Waiting for the day when the Windows GUI is just a desktop like GNOME/KDE running on a Linux or BSD base.  
probably worried about how many people hopped off github onto gitlab when microsoft acquired them. BTW gitlab does unlimited private repos and collaborators. I'd like them more if they did proper pull requests instead of those weird merge request things >.>  
The amount of people who dropped Github in favor of Gitlab was shown to be a drop in the bucket for Github (albeit a large pile of sand for Gitlab). So far it's nice and weird, but hey I'll take it.  
Nice! I have been waiting for this to track things in my personal spaces. Super exciting!!  
This is a big move that will have a  massive effect on BitBucket. It's why I went with them in the first place. ‚Äã Now, does the free account support LFS and how much storage?  
 back in 2008, Reddit Inc was a ragtag organization1 and the future of the company was very uncertain. We wanted to make sure the community could keep the site alive should the company go under and making the code available was the logical thing to do  Translation: We needed you guys back then. We don't now. The rest of it seems like a combination of technical hurdles that don't seem particularly compelling (they don't need to have secret new feature branches in their public repo) and some that don't make any sense (how does a move away from a monolithic repo into microservices change anything?) and some that are comical (our shit's so complicated to deploy and use that you can't use it anyway) It's sad that their development processes have effectively resulted in administrative reasons they can't do it. I remember them doing shenanigans like using their single-point-of-failure production RabbitMQ server to run the untested April fools thing this year (r/place) and in doing so almost brought everything down. So I'm not surprised that there doesn't seem to be much maturity in the operations and development processes over there. To be fair though, the reddit codebase always had a reputation for being such a pain that it wasn't really useful for much. Thankfully, their more niche open source contributions, while not particularly polished and documented, might end up being more useful than the original reddit repo. I know I've been meaning to look into the Websocket one.  
I guess they dont know they could make a private repo and update origin after the feature is done.  
[deleted]  
Just like they dropped "bastion of free speech" like a hot potato.  
Reddits original terms of service explicitly banned any kind of racist, sexist, homophobic, etc content/comments. Their "hands off" approach was originally more of a realization that they couldn't possibly moderate their site(and sure as fuck didn't want to be legally required to).  
To be fair, anybody that wants to make money would have to drop that ideal. Allowing borderline child porn, hate speech, etc. is a PR disaster.  
I'm fine with that but editing posts and getting caught for it is another thing. I don't care about removing posts and banning users as much as them having access to edit posts undetected.   
Just like Google dropped "Don't be evil" as soon as it became too profitable to be evil.  
If you're aiming to be a slow burn into a Facebook killer, you have to protect your assets early. I'm not necessarily happy, but Reddit's been behaving like a bookmarking service transforming into a social media platform.  
[deleted]  
To be fair, it does probably cut down on the number of "I'm angry and a downvote isn't enough" spam reports  
[deleted]  
[deleted]  
I don't know, both searches are equally useless and I just stick to google with "site:reddit.com/r/subredditiwant" suffixed.  
Don't underestimate the challenge of being one of the most popular websites on the internet. Dealing with that level of scalability brings it's own issues. I remember reading some of the reddit tech blogs a while back and they were interesting.   
My guess is that they do know that, but won't do it for reasons.  
That's pretty much what was done for a number of years. Changesets were cherry-picked into the public repo after ensuring a rollback or fixup wouldn't be needed.  
 and some that are comical (our shit's so complicated to deploy and use that you can't use it anyway)  To be fair, I've more than once tried to build something on Ubuntu, given up, and subscribed to a 3rd party PPA. Most packages do build, but there's a few that are just a nightmare.  Reddit could fix that, but I guess it's all time and money, and it might be optimised for their infra anyway. Although they could open source it and allow someone else to fix it...  
 they don't need to have secret new feature branches in their public repo  They don't, but there is a trade-off here. Long-lived branches are harder to merge. Open source contributors can't merge a branch they don't have access to. That means someone internal has to choose between (1) making it a priority to merge open source contributions into the feature branch (and dealing with the risks or inconveniences that entails) and (2) dealing with a harder merge later on. That's probably doable, but it's not a fictitious difficulty.  
git rebase is your friend. If you have a feature branch, it's your responsibility to regularly rebase (daily, ideally) from master and keep it mergeable. Simple.  
That's fine until you have two long lived feature branches. The first to get merged causes hundreds of conflicts in the other. Can be very painful.  
Just curious, are there are any companies that have moved to a microservice architecture that are open sourced? It does seem like it would be a lot harder to manage.  
We have at edX (https://github.com/edx). In addition to our LMS, we have forums, credentials, ecommerce, a marketing site, and course catalog services. The systems have some dependencies, but are mostly meant to operate and be deployed independently.   
Check out https://stackshare.io/. It'll tell you what tech stacks different companies are using.  
I can't think of anyone. Someone below mentioned Netflix: they FOSS a lot of tools but not their main services. Sounds like this is what Reddit is gonna do.  
I think Netflix is a good example of one that open sources many of their components. As for one where the whole product is open source and microservice based, I'm not sure. I'm sure others might have an example in mind. Some quick Googling showed a few like Travis CI. In general, I don't feel like the (sometimes dubious) organizational benefits from microservice architectures are a good fit for FOSS development. They tend to be better with strong centralized policies, leadership, etc., spreading work out to many teams. Things like having good CI, testing, etc. practices are all very important. The ones I've found Googling around have all been similar to Travis CI and Reddit insofar as they are a public facing open source repo of an industry developed tool (using hosted as a service), so frankly I don't see this as a compelling reason to can all plans to keep reddit itself FOSS. Orchestrating it with tooling like Kubernetes would make it much easier to manage, but it looks like reddit's has a lot of homegrown code to glue it together.  
Yeah, I don't think Netflix is any more open source than Reddit is after this change. Probably less, since their more monolithic bits were never open source.  
The value of Netflix Open Source was never in the "here is all our code for running a video service", but rather in seeing their approach to developing robust, low latency, fault tolerant systems.  Their approaches don't line up with the requirements of every project, but what they have developed it very useful within the ecosystem of their projects for a wide variety of situations.  There is alot to be learned by looking at what they have produced. Having said that, there is a clear rewrite/new approaches theme that has been running through their projects for the last few years.  The move from stable code bases to extensive rewrites using different programming styles, e.g. Functional Java and the RxJava libraries, that may not fit with many projects.  Also their fairly disjointed updates and how it lags behind their production system clearly won't work for everyone and honestly shouldn't be expected. However, having said all of that, there are a ton of valuable painfully learned lessons that can be taken from what they have released and can be of benefit to many large scale internet projects.  
Can you think of a SaaS product you've worked on where the product code wasn't intimately coupled to the automation code and deployment platforms? I certainly can't.  Netflix releases their tools as open source (and they have some pretty cool stuff) but they do not FOSS their product.  
Yes.  Everything we're building in docker+kubernetes these days.  The application code could be entirely open source without any issues so long as our yamls are stored separately and managed by Jenkins.  Api base paths are managed by kubedns and linkerd, so we don't even have to do that ourselves anymore.  Granted, only a few dozen of our services have been ported from Netflix so far (for testing purposes), but we are just finishing up auditing our first production readiness test of the environment, and everything looks good.    
Out of curiosity - why do you think the benefits of microservice architectures are sometimes dubious?   
It places way higher demands on the competence of the developers and ops people to avoid catastrophic failures. Poor choices in where to draw service boundaries can make dealing with problems inherent to distributed systems even worse.  Ultimately, it's often a YAGNI situation. I don't think there's any reason whatsoever to do something like reddit as microservices. It's wonderful at matching organizational decoupling with technical decoupling, even allowing radically different cultures and language preferences to coexist peacefully. I just don't see that being necessary for something like reddit.  
Popularity leads to money. Money leads to lawyers. Lawyers lead to suffering...  
Generally speaking, microservices architectures are (for better or worse) pretty closely coupled with their automation code and thus the platforms they run on. It's already difficult to get that stuff running in prod (staging too if you've got some cash): getting it set up so you can ship the whole thing to contributors is super difficult and it has diminishing returns. You're not just shipping code, you're shipping container orchestration configs, database configs, load balancing logic, and a bunch of other shit that isn't portable. It's one thing to have the code for the services available; if your contributors can't run it, it's not really open source. And having it out there in a broken state is worse than not having it at all. Reddit is SaaS and I don't know anyone who's been very successful at open-sourcing their MSA SaaS product.  
 And having it out there in a broken state is worse than not having it at all.  I disagree, broken code can still give a leg up when you really need it.  
 To be fair though, the reddit codebase always had a reputation for being such a pain that it wasn't really useful for much.   Ive never seen another web site crash as much as reddit.  To this day it still crashes with some regularity. inb4 "but lots of users" reddit has big boy corporate financial backing and has been around for ~10+ yrs reddit goes down more than someone w/low self esteem.   
 how does a move away from a monolithic repo into microservices change anything?  Sounds like someone's never worked in a monolithic repo.  
Monolithic in this case is vs. service based. I'm not talking about the Windows repo here.  
I snagged a copy of the closed source: print("all of our servers are busy right now")  print("please try again in a minute")  print("(error code: 503)")   
You forgot to link an image of a cat, that's a very important part of the codebase.  
print("Oh noes, something went wrong")   
Oh, updated to Python 3?  
That is also valid python2 code.  
If I read it right, it's not so much that it's "no longer" open source, but hasn't been truly open for a while now and they're just giving up on maintaining the open version.  Because of the above, our internal development, production and ‚Äúfeature‚Äù branches have been moving further and further from the ‚Äúcanonical‚Äù state of the open source repository. Such balkanization means that merges are getting increasingly difficult, especially as the company grows and more developers are touching the code more frequently.  So in effect, they made a private fork of their own code and it's now diverged to the point where they can't feasibly maintain both. It's sad but I suppose inevitable when your business model involves using your code rather than giving it to other people and selling support. Any users of your code are not potential customers but competitors. However, since their source apparently remains available under a semi-free copyleft license (CPAL), maybe there will be a community-maintained fork of some kind.

Isn't voat a fork of reddit? I know they're not exactly doing good things with the code, but it's the biggest example I know of  
[deleted]  
IIRC, voat was originally a project for it's author to learn C#  
I only just learned about voat. Jesus christ that place is a cesspool...  
Voat's bigger on free speech so every community that Reddit has banned has run over there so it's not a classy place.  
 It's sad but I suppose inevitable when your business model involves using your code rather than giving it to other people and selling support. Any users of your code are not potential customers but competitors.  It's not often that I say this, but Facebook has the exact right attitude about this: open-source anything that's not a part of your core product. Sure, you give back to the community which is nice and all and you may reap rewards from pull requests here-and-there. But a side benefit is that you're creating a new pool of future employees already familiar with your internal technology. I mean, imagine React was closed-sourced. It would be a nightmare to ramp-up new front-end devs.  
[deleted]  
Not only web development either. Open source fuels pretty much every aspect of software. Mad respect for everyone that contributes and maintains OSS.   
It sounds like Reddit is going to be using a similar model:  We believe in open source, and want to make sure that our contributions are both useful and meaningful. We will continue to open source tools that are of use to engineers everywhere Much of the core of Reddit is based on open source technologies (Postgres, python, memcached, Cassanda to name a few!) and we will continue to contribute to projects we use and modify (like¬†gunicorn,¬†pycassa, and¬†pylibmc). We recently contributed¬†a performance improvement¬†to¬†styled-components, the framework we use for styling the redesign, which was picked up by¬†brcast¬†and¬†glamorous. We also have some more upcoming¬†perf patches!   
 It's sad but I suppose inevitable when your business model involves using your code rather than giving it to other people and selling support. Any users of your code are not potential customers but competitors.  You'd think so, but there are a bunch of for-profit businesses that do just fine open-sourcing their core code. It's the community effect. Everybody's here. Even a truly superior product to reddit basically can't compete at this point, unless reddit does something to severely piss off the community, which given this announcement I expect is coming.  
Yeah, I think we should still be thankful Reddit gave the open source community as much as they did. I can't think of any other tech companies that open source so much of their code, so this is pretty much to be expected.  
A large portion of WordPress.com is open-source, including the entire custom JavaScript-based front end: https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/ Lots more at https://github.com/Automattic Disclaimer: I'm an employee.  
Haha I didn't even realize WordPress was a business rather than an open-sourced framework. That's great though! How do you guys make money? Do you guys get anything from like WPEngine?  
WordPress VIP charges Enterprise users quite a bit of money for managed hosting  
WordPress itself is a framework owned by no-one. The main founder started a for-profit (Automattic) which runs the SAAS WordPress.com. It's a freemium service where a percentage of users buy paid upgrades (such as a custom domain) and that pays for the service as a whole. We also have paid employees whose entire job is to contribute back to the open-source WordPress project.  
Depends what you call a tech company. There's centOS, nginx, owncloud/nextcloud and firefox.  
It would be funny if Oracle acquired reddit.  
It'd be ironic if Digg merged with Reddit, and funny if Oracle bought the result.  
And then Google just swallows up the entire company, merging it with Google Plus.  
But how will Ellison pay for his sailboats?  Or would he have Reddit charge user name/moderator licenses like Oracle charges for cores?  
I'm no expert when it comes to code architecture and large codebases but it seems to me like their codebase is horribly organized with over a decade worth of code being written without any major cleanup being done. There is no way to understand how all these pieces fit together cuz there are no meaningful comments in most of the files. How do you even keep developing on this codebase as it's such a mess. Is this a shit codebase or am I simply too negative?   
 How do you even keep developing on this codebase as it's such a mess.  People who have been developing this mountain of shitty code either: 1. have been there such a long time, they hold the map to most of it in their head. 2. take a really long time to get familiar with it with the reluctant help of people who fall in category #1, and eventually they drift to #1 themselves.  
3 Don't have a work ethic and feel about wading through spaghetti code and taking weeks on a feature that should take hours roughly the same as working at a gas station: "Eh, it pays the bills" / just a job 4 Have a huge work ethic and great sense of architecture but after working with #3 for a while and trying to make changes either turns into #1 or #3 or quits the system in protest   
I think 3 is more of a societal issue then an individual issue though. It's too easy to blame "lazy programmers" with "no work ethic" but when you have a 9-5 and a mortgage to pay it's hard not to be in that category.  
Other people who seem to know what they are talking about tend to agree that the code is shitty  
Apparently they think so themselves as they're going to be rewriting the whole thing using a modern tech stack. Also partitioning the monolith into services I assume. The reason why they decided to make this new codebase closed source is most likely because they secured 200 million dollars in funding mostly for this and they don't want to give away the "new" project for free.  
You're not too negative.  What happens when you start a project like Reddit is that:  What you start making and what you end up making are vastly different The infrastructure buckles under its own weight as it was never designed to handle the load  It ends up with more patchwork fixes than you can possibly imagine and new features become cumbersome to add The real-world realities of law, business, tech and art all have conflicting objectives; balance and compromise is required everywhere for the overall project to succeed.  Side-note: this is why you see techies often distilling it down to comments like "hey moran just quazlinate the databases over a frickle wire with a Unix blort" ... it's because they only see the details of their profession and speak as though the other realities of business don't exist.   
As /u/VanToch said in the comments:  Open source doesn't mean there has to be a github repo accepting pull requests. It doesn't mean that all changes need to be available immediatelly. Source code tarball released after deploying your releases (so that you can still develop "in the clear") would still be open source and would solve your problems.  This seems to be a much better solution than just close sourcing it.  
Guess it's time to update the sidebar, unless "steal our code" isn't just a turn of phrase anymore.  
And the "Source Code" on the site-wide footer.  
/u/spladug:  we're a big enough company now that, unfortunately, we have to think about people trying to divine our strategy from the repos and beat us to the punch.  /u/Lt_Riza_Hawkeye:  Right, so why not push over all of the changes to the public repo AFTER videos have been implemented and are live on production, rather than during their implementation. It seems to me like that would solve both problems  /u/Kaitaan:  Because features aren't developed in a vacuum, especially when you're working with a monolith.  If, in your example, video was the only thing being worked on at a given time, then sure, that would be easy.  But if it's not (and really, what company is only doing one thing at a time), now someone has to go cherry-pick all the commits that were video-related, make sure they don't contain anything not video-related, make sure they don't rely on anything not video-related, redo all the testing, fix anything that was missing from those commits, and hope that nothing else changed while they were doing all the above.  That alone is a full-time job, and not a fun one.  I mean, isn't this precisely what branches are for? Serious question because I've never work on a large team. It seems they only have master, testing, and dev branches. Wouldn't it make sense to dev videos in one branch and secretx in another when you have 100 devs?

Wouldn't it make sense to dev videos in one branch and secretx in another when you have 100 devs?  Fair question. Typically to prevent merge conflicts, your feature branch will merge from master or some integration branch fairly frequently to make sure that your changes are compatible with other changes or features. That's how other feature's code would show up in your feature branch.

Wouldn't it make sense to dev videos in one branch and secretx in another when you have 100 devs?  Long branching is nearly impossible at scale. Companies like Facebook and Google don't even use feature branches, they hide features behind flags, and develop the features directly on "master", but keep the code paths disabled until they want to flip them on.  
 we're a big enough company now that, unfortunately, we have to think about people trying to divine our strategy from the repos and beat us to the punch.  This is irrelevant. It's not trivial, but it's not very complex, to create a new reddit. VOAT for example is made by 1 guy, and although that site is also a mess, at least it works similarly. What is relevant is your market share and keeping it.   
[deleted]  
Oh good, now that you've used that word on them you can't use it on mine should you ever see it.   
They should port it back to Lisp. . . no Arc.  
And rename subbreddits to shubreddit?  
You don't shay...  
/r/shubreddit  
Can you link to the bits you consider bad?  
I guess it's not that different from before. Many of the anti-spam measures were already known to be closed source and in the end there was no way to verify what's running on the servers anyway.  
I‚Äôm speculating that closing their source code is the result of this recent ruling about ownership of content on social network sites. After all if your source code is already open and then it turns out you don‚Äôt even own your site content what unique assets do you actually have? reddit has always argued that they own a license to their user‚Äôs submissions but if this ruling weakens that argument then they probably have to take some steps to mollify their investors. Edit: for accuracy  
What makes Reddit useful to investors is not the content of the site, only it's big user base. What money could Reddit get from the users' posts and comments? Not much. Having millions of eyeballs on an ad webpage + semi-regular donations? There's the value. Plus open-source doesn't mean that you don't own the code, you still do. It's just theoretically possible for someone to run his own instance, fork the code and modify it. The code in Reddit's repo is still owned by Reddit.  
Open source doesn't mean you don't own the source code. It means you offer a license to other people for free if they meet certain conditions specified by that license.  All open source must offer a license of some sort or it's effectively useless. Generally they fall under MIT license, GPL, GPG, etc. each license limits what you can or can't do with the source code.  Breaking terms of the license amounts to piracy and opens you up to a lawsuit.

Awww ... it'll no longer be the same. Now they join the forces of evil.  
it's probably related to this: Reddit raised $200 million in funding and is now valued at $1.8 billion  
Can't wait to get my cut of this funding!  
Reddit notes anyone? LOL.

you'll get nothing and like it.

confirmed. site was indeed spez'd long ago. sad!  
When are we gonna go like digg migration 3.0 and forge the new Reddit and Make The Internet Great Again!  
They tried that with Voat, but sadly the first groups to migrate in high numbers were /r/fatpeoplehate and extra+ racists. So... now anyone contemplating going there has to factor in that it has like four times the concentration of user based awfulness that reddit has. Even with reddit having more admin based awfulness and Voat paying more attention to what features users want (like displaying number of up and downvotes), Voat just isn't very appealing in comparison. Now sure, if everyone moved there the current loonies would be drowned out and it would have the same concentration of good and bad as reddit does but with better admins and features, but it's hard to get there. So basically, now we need a new new alternative.  
 Now they join the forces of evil.  I'd say google is now officially in the doing evil business. So, what's in store for reddit??  
"we're doing some shady shit that we don't want public"  
"I'm deleting my account and not coming back"  
But they never did anything to cause people do doubt the site was administered with anything but a fair and even hand for all subreddits! ¬† /s obviously?  
So are they going to have problems in the future, since they took in code from outside devs?  They can't close source that code. Won't that limit reddit from ever selling their platform to others?  If they distribute anything, they would have to open source it.  
They leave it on GitHub forever, the end. It's available there.  
 They can't close source that code.  Sure they can.  Read section 6 of the license.  Reddit is allowed to change the license terms at any time.  You may continue to use the code under the current license, but they get to use it under any license they want.  
[deleted]  
So long and thanks for all the fish code  
 Open-source makes it hard for us to develop some features "in the clear" (like our recent video launch) without leaking our plans too far in advance.  This works just fine for GitLab. The few times we have to keep something secret (e.g. security fixes) we develop the feature on a private GitLab instance, then merge it into the main (and public) repository once it's ready to go.  
Oh no.....  
This combined with all of the censorship scandals and corporate shilling has finally convinced me that Reddit has gone full circle and pulled a Digg. They've sold out. Time to do what we did when Digg stopped giving a shit about it's fanbase.  
Migrate to Fark?  
Drew just spilled his beer all over the servers in anticipation.  
I've heard Digg references like 3 times over the past 5 years. But Fark? holy shit!! haven't heard that name in 10+ years or something.  
If that means that they realise that they fucked up with the reddit app and the mobile site, then I'm all for it. /s They've wasted time and effort on an experience that is inferior and frankly poor for a company of reddit's stature. Also, they complain of the realities of being open source when they have 100 developers. Like having 100 developers is a huge deal. I work with companies many times larger who manage OSS, contributions and PRs without much effort. So, for reddit to turn around and moan about the effort required to balance between their private, proprietary code and their public OSS code shines a light on how bloated their codebase has become.

So sad that Aaron Swartz can't rest in peace.  
At least he didn't have to see reddit, a 12 year old site become a fucking corporation and not even have a rich text editor or fucking preview option when writing posts and comments. In the last 5 years reddit hasn't received any significant update that improves the experience for the end-user directly. I wrote about it at some length here https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/6xfyfg/an_update_on_the_state_of_the_redditreddit_and/dmg4c9x/?context=3 Yes, Aaron was a freedom advocate but I'm sure he knew the whole point of it was that open-source led to higher quality software. I'm sure he'd feel the same way as me looking at reddit as a major project, making major money (at least at keeping itself afloat) and not receiving a fucking update to basic functionalities in 5 years. Aaron was a programmer first and an advocate second. From that point of view, he'd look at reddit and think "welp, that's a dead project, it's going nowhere fast". May he RIP.  
 In the last 5 years reddit hasn't received any significant update that improves the experience for the end-user directly  This 'report' button for comments now is absolute trash. If I wanted to use Facebook, I'd go use Facebook.  
Reddit also use to be a place where people's discussion was based on votes rather than the biases of their admins and advertisers.  
It was  
So...fork?  
So many comments seem to think this is some indicator that they've turned evil. If they have, it's unrelated to this change. How useful was it ever that the codebase was open source? Did anyone ever stand up their own clone of reddit and run it on the open internet? It seems impractical to maintain a codebase like this in the open, and from what I've heard they're doing a major rewrite, which would make it even more complicated. If no one uses it, why maintain it?  
Less Wrong's discussion section is a Reddit instance, I think.  
Apparently that's the one and only interesting deployment, according to an old reddit blog post.  
I wanted to stand up an internal clone of Reddit for my company to use as an internal discussion board alternative to email. Unfortunately, their licensing is too restrictive for me to do so anyway. So for me at least, Reddit being open source made no difference.   
What were the licensing terms that were a deal-breaker for your plan?  
The CPAL license had some issue that wasn't compatible. I'm not a lawyer, I just don't do what the lawyers tell me not to do.   
Lawyers are no fun.  
[deleted]  
They basically admitted to having "hidden admin tools" years ago, at least when it comes to antispam tooling, specifically.  The fact that they kept antispam stuff secret was well known.  
That type of admin tool is no reason to keep them from going open-source: they can just update reddit's source code day in and day out and not upload their tools anywhere. If they don't want to publicize the core system itself its because there's much more sinister stuff happening to the core of the website itself (potentially to every single post). When I say sinister though, I don't mean necessarily that they're sucking your soul every time you write a comment, of course - but they could be: that's the deal with closed source software.  
You say that as if they don't already have those. Of course we can't know, but given the previous spez incident it's very likely they do.  
There's no way they bothered making admin tools to change user's posts since everyone agreed they should never do that. Spez almost certainly just changed the database directly.  
just because the project is open sourced doesn't mean it's the version they deploy  
It didn't even have all of the features of deployed reddit.   
Reddit code is a pure shit. Move along.  
But I can't leave...   
Exactly, I've been complaining about reddit for well over a decade but no true successor has materialized. . .  
ITT Non programmers talking about things they know nothing about   
Huh, it's interesting that support for bots was actually part of the design spec considering the controversy they caused. I don't disagree, it's just interesting.   
That's probably because it was supposed to be a short-lived project, so it even makes it interesting - first wave, only actual hand-crafted pixels, then a mix of hand-crafted and bots starting with a low percentage of bots and increasing... At the beginning the more interesting part is the collaboration between humans on the same project, but at the point where all "big" projects were controlled by bots, the most interesting part is the human interaction between projects to respect limits, etc  
Bots aren't inherently bad, either. We go crazy when we see them on social media and news commentary because those there are actual consequences to the ripples of distortion they cause. Outside of communication, we generally accept that bots are fascinating to design and watch. While bots on /r/Place diminished the power of individuals to interact with the board, those individuals were likely aware that they had little power to begin with. Within moments of encountering Place, any user could see that there was no way for order to defeat chaos so long as the two were equals. Maintaining an image required constant human interaction while destroying that same image hardly even required being awake--just click and repeat randomly. This immediately introduced the problem solving aspect of the setup. Individual users lost their power the moment subreddits and social networks opened up channels for organization. /r/BlueCorner made my efforts moot long before bots did. Bots, then, were an evolution of the competition. Had the time limit been endless, random users would have disappeared and their power would have grown ever greater. I can see how that would have been boring but, within the limited timeframe, I think the bots were a valid and interesting strategy.  
 Maintaining an image required constant human interaction while destroying that same image hardly even required being awake--just click and repeat randomly.  There's a metaphor in here somewhere.  
There's a lesson too. Just give up to AI. It'll be better that way.   
creating is hard - it requires you to do everything right Destroying, on the other hand, is easy: All you have to do is get one thing wrong idk where I heard that, but I agree with it.  
I use the general concept of lazy chaos versus strenuous order quite a lot:   It takes you ten minutes to answer a question, ten seconds for me to ask one, and ten nanoseconds for me to lose interest in your reply. For every stance, there's an easily googled questionnaire that requires expertise in a dozen different disciplines to fully satisfy. If it turns out you are, in fact, talking to someone who can pull that off... well, just ask another question. You can't convince a person to hear you out, either, so after delivering a masterful lecture on the history of macroeconomics in the southern hemisphere as it applies to the rise and fall of political dictatorships you might come to find that the person on the other end hasn't heard a word of it. (source comment)   We'd previously seen how hard work could build a massive grassroots network through extensive use of social media but we neglected to realize that those same enormous forces could be used to tear networks back down again for a fraction of the cost. It's like castles vs. cannons or card houses vs. small children. Only one side feels the pain of failure and the exertion of the battle. The other analogy I like to play with is the idea that online communities are surrounded by a thin membrane of combative and confrontational individuals. Though they make up only a fraction of the community's population, they quickly and efficiently batter foreigners to a pulp before they ever reach the rest. Being ourselves free to pass through the membrane, the only way we know it's happening is through the anecdotes of the few survivors who pass through and collapse in crazed frustration at our feet. Anyway, the solution is to be aware of it and come up with ways to selectively neuter the chaos. Use a panopticon of awareness to burn the trolls the moment the step out from under the bridge. Attach a stigma to a behavior and release it back into the wild: it won't last long. Just look at what happened to poor Pepe the frog.  
I agree. Just as humans have come together to build houses and roads, redditors came together to collectively create images larger than what any one individual could manage.  And just as humans invented bulldozers and nail guns to automate shoveling and hammering, redditors invented bots to automate pixel placement.  The bots didn't take away from the social marvel of Place; they enhanced it by mirroring humans' real-world inventiveness.  
I would have liked to see it continue on as a communal botting competition. I found the cross community negotiations much more interesting than the earlier mobs.  
This was probably influenced by the fantastic work people did on scripts for Robin -- adding channels (hashtags), spam filters, encrypted messaging, trivia bots, auto-voting on room changes.... Someone wrote code to reconstruct the ancestry of each chat and someone else presented it as a dashboard with countdowns and predictions. Someone even developed an IRC gateway for Robin. The developer community that sprang up around Robin was something that I found particularly interesting, and which I think was critical to keeping it as long-lived as it was (getting to T17 ccKufi).  
Holy shit. The button was 2015. I could have swore it was last year. Totally forgot about robin.   
Robin was definitely the least interesting of the three. I had forgotten about it within about a week. Still, that's better than most April Fools jokes.  
I'd argue the opposite actually. It may not have been as accessible as the button or r/place but I think the communities that developed from Robin were much more meaningful. Though as part of the final group that made it to T17, I might be biased a lil bit.  
I was completely engaged with Robin,  albeit for a shorter period of time than the Button. The Button was really cool, and it spawned a ton of interesting discourse (that persists to this day and continues to be pretty amusing), but it didn't really extend much further than that. There was really nothing else to it - you either pressed it or you didn't, and you went to the subreddit to discuss your decision.   Robin, on the other hand, required real dedication and engagement to get to the higher levels - I believe I stayed in a room for 12 - 15 hours, and much of that I was glued to my screen, chatting and monitoring what the other rooms were doing. I was in a room that broke the record towards the end. It was a pretty awesome experience - everyone in chat had been there for hours, just waiting to merge, and when we finally did, everyone was just going crazy with excitement. I'll never forget that experience.   I think I've enjoyed the last 3 April Fools projects equally. Reddit has really been doing a fantastic job with them.   edit: Video of the death of my room, where there were too many AFKs to vote so we defaulted to stay.    
Pardon me - what's Robin?  After clicking on your links, and checking on google, my perfunctory research has left me with nil.   Thanks in advance!  
Last year's April Fools on reddit. You'd start in a chat room with you and one other person and then you'd merge with another group of 2. Then 4, than 8.. It took longer each time because the room you merged with  had to be around the same size. The final merge days after April 1st of the two largest chat rooms of thousands of people literally broke reddit and they were forced to immediately end it.   
Huh. I have no memory of Robin. I must not have given that any chance at all or must have been off reddit during that time. Odd.   
Thank you!  I had no idea - I was actually just wondering what was done on Reddit last year for April Fool's - I too (like another user) thought it was the Button.  How time flies.  How the hell did I miss this?    
Is there a chance we can get a raw data dump of all the activity on r/place?  Tuples of {timestamp, x, y, color}?  
Yeah, that'll be released at some point in the future EDIT: here it is https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdata/comments/6640ru/place_datasets_april_fools_2017/  
<3  
Could we get that with anonymized(or not) usernames?  
Getting the usernames (anonymized or not - though I doubt they'd release the actual usernames) would be cool. It would be fascinating data to comb through. You could see certain users that would purposely destroy things. You could probably weed out single mistakes versus systemic trolls. Having the users not anonymized would be cool too - you could see if their behavior on place was similar to their behavior on reddit posts/comments. But that's probably why they'd be prone to anonymize it.  
An interesting middle ground would be to replace usernames with random strings. That way you can still find trends for users, but it doesn't link to their actual reddit account.   
I don't think there's any point in anonymizing the usernames since they were available and collected while place was running.  Trying to anonymize them now would be like trying to put a genie back in a bottle.

We absolutely need to know who committed the terrible crime against humanity of putting the black pixel in Canada 150, turning it into Canada 158.  
ohhhhhhhh I was wondering what the hell CANADA 158 was supposed to be. That's pretty funny.

cppdevlpr.io. better grab that domain ya hipster.  
what do you mean? there is nothing wrong with the modern JS toolchain! /s To the sad js devs: here, take this pointer as a show of my sorro.... oh, sorry.  
I would but instead of type erroring it just returned an empty string.  
As a NodeJS developer who has a handful of .io domains and removes vowels sometimes I feel like I am being judged. Coffee shops are great. Music, conversation, chai, etc.   
It's okay, stereotypes exist for a reason haha   
I laughed at this image last year.  A few months later, I found myself in a coffee shop working on a node project using a macbook pro.  
My man, you're displaying 3 words and an icon. What the fuck do you need bootstrap and jQuery for on that first website?  
Fuck that guy Sublime Text is fucking lit.  
It's not about any given technology being bad, but the combination of all these makes a stereotype.  
It's all about Atom now mang.  
Atom was so 2016. 2017 is all about VSCode.  
 :( y'all don't even step to Emacs   
We stopped drinking lattes a long time ago. We've moved onto vanilla lattes, caramel lattes, smoked caramel lattes, green tea lattes, and latte lattes. EDIT: Almost forgot about smoked latte lattes.  
 green tea lattes  um excuse me m'normie I think you mean matcha, AKA traditional ~~ Japanese desu ~~ ceremonial powdered tea of the highest quality, not this plebeian green tea Western garbage  
I used to make matcha smoothies every morning years ago. It is a great way to get energized for the day and I think I worked better. Now days I just drink copious amounts of iced chai.   
I masturbate and then lose all my motivation   
What about Latke lattes ?  
And Ryan Lachttes?  
God made tail -f for a reason  
Now I want parody artisan videos about coders   
This hand-crafted flamegraph comes from a real gem of a place, the local Perl shop. Our man in the mountains catches bytes in his packet filter, then walks them down, across the data stream, and delivers them to our message queue. Once in the message queue, they are cast into their true shape - application logs - in our low-level wrapper. Finally, they are reshaped, coloured and displayed using vector graphics, so that no matter how deep the stack or how hot the cache, you can be sure your hand-crafted flame graph is up to snuff.  
This is going directly to my resume.  
It's funny, we use "artisanal" as a derogatory term where I work.  I assume they meant it similarly here, heh.  
I smirked because I assumed they meant a shitty throw-away script  
There's really no assumption necessary... the next line literally has the entirety of the script, including the name "s****y_diamond.sh"  
Looking at the actual script (and its name), it's clear they meant a shitty quick-and-dirty thing.  
I'm so happy that finally somebody got how BITFIELD is useful in certain applications, and happened to use it in the coolest project of the year.  
<3  
I enjoyed this, but I'm curious about one thing.  Sometimes my browser didn't get updates.  I once worked for an hour on a section, only to load it in another browser and find out that I was changing the wrong tiles because I had a outdated picture in the browser I was using.  I finally checked another browser because I was surprised at my progress (which had previously been stymied by others reversing my work.) Were you aware of that happening, or that it was possible?  
Due to the nature of the project (launch all at once with minimal testing) we weren't able to find all the bugs in advance, and once we did launch it was dangerous to fix bugs, especially ones that were only effecting a small number of users.  
I understand.  Thanks.  
Affecting, Mr. /u/bsimpson.  
[deleted]  
This happened to me a lot.  When I realized it and refreshed, I was surprised to find it had changed so much.  That's when I started refreshing before each move. It would have been easier if I realized sooner that can you use the coordinates in the URL :)  
I also found that sometimes my placed pixels wouldn't "take". I'd place it down and client-side it'd show. But then I'd reload the page and go to the exact pixel and find that it hadn't changed and had the old pixel still there (another user's name, 5+ minutes ago, etc).

i'm guessing bots were mainly responsible for the more elaborate images like the mona lisa and such.  
If you watch a place timelapse you'll see two Mona Lisa's emerging at the same time.  The one on the left being drawn by users and the one on the right by a single user running a script controlling a large group of bots. What is telling is that the human drawn one starts with the face (the collaborators decided this would be the best way to get others interested in the project).  The one being drawn by bots prints pixel-by-pixel in a very obvious fashion.  Details like this make me love these projects.  
What's interesting is how poorly the bot defended it's art. Since it was doing line by line, left to right it probably checked for pixels that had been overwritten in the same fashion and replaced them. Which means with enough people the bot would just get stuck repairing the top most part. The one on the left is less worried about an individual pixel and more worried about recognizable features. This, IMO, is a more effective defense as it would allow the users to get large features with minor defacing on the canvas then worry about the smaller, less impactful parts.   
Once the face was finished most activity seems to be around the eyes and mouth. They just glow in the heatmap https://youtu.be/1tT0F6ZPG-I?t=11 .  
I don't think the starting point is really a good indicator of whether or not it's a bot, I just think it shows a divide between two different thought processes. I used to do a lot of pixel art and for the most part I would start from the top-left and make my way over just like you see in the video. It could very well have been a bot, but I'm sure at least half of those filling in the top-left were real people who just saw it as the most logical starting point.  
Huh, I would have expected the opposite.  Were I to write a bot, I would have it focus on the middle first and work its way out, and it seems like it'd be easier to organize humans by having them go in a simple top-down pattern.  
Nerds.  
Cannot confirm. The board was 1000x1000, not 1024x1024.  
 Cannot confirm. The board was 1000x1000, not 1024x1024.  they would have done 1024x1024, but the hdd they bought to put it on was smaller than expected.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibibyte  
"exbibyte" must be one of the hardest words to roll off the tongue.  
Sound similar to what someone would call their previous omnivorous one night stand: ex-bi-bite.  
I don't support your new-fangled hippie language. I grew up with a kilobyte being 1024 bytes and that's how it stays for me. Next you're going to tell me a byte is 10 bits or some such nonsense just to make your math easier.  
Pi is equal to exactly 3!  
Most of my favorite nerds are reddit nerds.  
So bots were an intentional part of it. I didn't write a bot for fear of breaking the law in doing so.  Was I wrong?  
Bots have been a big part of the past couple april fools projects. The community comes up with cool use cases that we didn't think of or didn't have time to implement.  
Does that mean that there were Reddit sanctioned bots pressing the button? It's a conspiracy...  
Yes! Bots were a large reason why it kept going for so long.  
Actually bots (meaning purely automatic clicking, not people trying to get red with tools, etc.) have kept the button going only for the last week or so. Real living people have kept it going for months.  
Bot sabotage/malfunction was also the reason why it didn't go much, much longer. Guy who ran some critical ones got donated non-working accounts and didn't check beforehand :/  
How would bots help? They only supported accounts created before that April Fools day.  
I'll... keep that in mind for next year. :) Edit: I'm learning a bit about how to write useful technical documentation from this article, so thanks for that.  
Worst case scenario, writing a bot for something like this would be against the site's terms of service, but it would never be against the law.  
Okay, it's kind of tangential but I have to say this, all that you guys wrote on the blog looks so overwhelming to me. I am a CS major, I'll graduate next year but I could barely understand anything. I am just scared I mightn't be good for programming and stuff when I see crazy stuff like this. When do you learn this, during work? How hard are these things to learn and how does the intuition come?   
I always get pretty intimidated at the start of a project, particularly when it seems like it's big and I'm not sure how to do it from the get go. That's OK though. Just tear it apart into smaller pieces and see if you can make sense of them and then come back and look at how it all fits together after a bit of that tactical work. I think you'll surprise yourself with what you can do when you stop being daunted by the overall project and just solve some problems. In the end, just remember this: no one knows what they're doing and everything in engineering is tradeoffs. Have fun!  
 no one knows what they're doing and everything in engineering is tradeoffs.  the head of my schools IT  department put it like this: the internet is  built out of bullshit held together by caffeine and hope  
Sounds about right :)  
Reminds me of one of my favorite programming articles.  Websites that are glorified shopping carts with maybe three dynamic pages are maintained by teams of people around the clock, because the truth is everything is breaking all the time, everywhere, for everyone. Right now someone who works for Facebook is getting tens of thousands of error messages and frantically trying to find the problem before the whole charade collapses. There's a team at a Google office that hasn't slept in three days. Somewhere there's a database programmer surrounded by empty Mountain Dew bottles whose husband thinks she's dead. And if these people stop, the world burns.   
 the internet is built out of bullshit held together by caffeine and hope  I need to get a calligrapher to do a wood-burning of that and put it on my desk.  
EXACTLY THIS.  There's still a lot of stuff on /r/programming that flies over my head, after being a programmer for nearly 20 years.  This write up makes perfect sense to me, though, because it deals with tech I use every day -- redis, Node, HTML5, caches, and sockets.  Experience helps a bunch. I've given this talk to a lot of beginner programmers:  When you first start out somewhere, you are going to think you're the dumbest one there, and everyone is light-years ahead of you.  It still happens to me.  But you keep grinding at it, until you understand it all.  One day in a meeting, you'll look at all your co-workers and say, "Wait... you guys are a dumb as I am!"

I know there's a ton of testimonials already, but I figured I'd toss mine in too. My school did a mandatory internship program (paid) and lots of companies in the surrounding area were on board. I got in at a dev shop with my buddy, and we were two sophomores in a workplace of 11 full time programmers who had been in the field for years. My buddy was a genius and in the first week I had an entire meltdown where I went out to my car and cried because I had zero idea what I was doing. I called my mom and talked about switching majors. She convinced me to give it one term of the internship. In the first month I realized that all those intelligent engineers used to be in my position, and they would go above and beyond to help me learn. The biggest thing I learned is that almost no code is written from 'scratch'. Most of my learning came from a coworker that taught me how to find code that already exists in a different application, and bend that code to do what I actually want it to do. Keep it up, and never be afraid to ask for help.  
Thank you! That's encouraging  
To add to that, I was in a similar position 8 months ago. I had finished my second year of University, and had an internship as a software developer lined up for a year before I would go into my final year. I'm nearing the end of the internship now. I have learned so much more this year from practical work than I did in two years of University. If I had read this 8 months ago I wouldn't have understood a word. (Now I understand like, half? :P) Honestly one of the main things I've learnt from this year is that in Comp Sci related jobs, no one knows everything. You learn as you go through a project, and collaborating with others who have the knowledge you don't. Don't worry about it, it's perfectly normal.  
 no one knows what they're doing and everything in engineering is tradeoffs  This is also true of life in general.  
 This was a team project so no one needed to know or understand everything. Having good coworkers or other people you can learn from and get help from is extremely valuable. I'm constantly learning new things and encountering systems or concepts that I don't understand. Not knowing things is fine and it's better to recognize you don't know something and try to learn than it is to pretend you know everything. Most things you can learn through experience. Web applications can be complex systems, but they're not rocket science and if you try to keep things simple and boring you'll do well.   
This makes me want a job in a true dev environment so bad. I started learning HTML/CSS about 9 months ago to transition out of a career in sales. Wound up starting a construction materials company with an old boss and took on the responsibility of managing our technology. It's lonely being a brand new dev in a good old boy industry like this. I always get so jealous and day dreamy when I read accounts like yours. Just to be in an environment where there were people with experience to learn from sounds so awesome.  
I'm in this positionas well. Being the only dev in a workplace can have its benefits. One of the major downsides is you are never really sure if what you're doing is actually good. Everyone seems pretty pleased because it works, but I'm always afraid of running into another developer who will look at it tell me it's garbage.  
I think if it works, its pretty good.  
Haha, yeah. I haven't really ventured very deep as I am usually occupied with course related stuff. Now I think I could have been doing projects like these. Really interesting. Thanks for sharing!  
Just a tip from a recent-grad with some great jobs already under my belt, start working on a portfolio right now. Doesn't matter what's in it, just start working on projects that have nothing to do with your schooling. You will grow much faster as a developer if you get experience with starting and completing projects on your own. Plus, when it comes time to get a job, having a degree and some completed projects will put you leagues ahead of your fellow graduates who don't have a portfolio.  And when trying to decide what to do for your first project, the smaller the better. Think of a time estimate, multiply by 4, if it's over 3 months maybe take on something smaller.

Impostor Syndrome is also very common in CS. There's so much to know, and looking at others, they always seem like they know so much more than you. No matter how long you work, you'll always find new things that you have no fucking understanding of.  
I'm graduating in about a month with a degree in IT and a software engineering gig lined up, and I'm definitely feeling this.   
Heh, so I've been doing stuff roughly like this for a 10-15 years now, after doing a master's in computer science. You will always be feeling like you're out of your depth (and if not, consider moving on unless there are other circumstances), you will always be learning new systems, especially at a place of any scale, and you will hopefully learn to enjoy it. You won't be bored if you don't want to be. The best thing to learn (and i still am) is to ask questions of the people who know more than you.  
A CS education gives you a lot of the theoretical background you need to understand programming, and a little bit of practical experience. To really get up to speed on practical things you need to do one or more of the following:  Internships or entry level jobs Learning on your own by reading up online, looking into open source projects or reading articles like this on the design of larger systems Working on your own personal projects  I would recommend that if you haven't done any kind of programming or technical work outside of school yet, start ASAP. Work on a free-time project, can be just a couple of hours a week. Find an internship for the summer. Read up on tools and techniques outside what you're taught in school.  
This was especially great to read because I have spent a few evenings creating a simple r/place clone. It has been easy to pretend that it is a really simple application when I've been running it on localhost, testing with two browser windows. Scaling it up to 100k clients makes it a total different ball game, turning a little programming puzzle into a feat of web engineering.  
That's a great project to work on and even more fun to start untangling the ball of wax that is scaling!  
Terrific write-up, just the right amount of details. Very interesting to see the design decisions that went into before and while /r/place was active, including some of the unforeseen issues. Thanks for a great April Fools Day.   
How much time was spent building /r/place? It seemed like a much bigger project than your earlier April Fool's projects  
From the source, it looks like they started in January: https://github.com/reddit/reddit-plugin-place-opensource/commit/68498bab9300f43ae4273dd4719dcecb081126f7  
That's dedication   
This is my last chance to ask this...    What did the odd pyramid/eye icon do in the top right? This one.   
It would follow around to zones of high activity.  u/madlee said he used some kind of serial killer algorithm.  
Yep ‚Äì¬†it kept track of the last 100 (IIRC) pixel updates and attempted to find the most "interesting" one.  I don't know how well it actually did that, but it did seem to function well enough as a sort of "spectator mode".  
I think it made it scroll to changes as they happened.   
Illuminati confirmed.

 The array for place's 1000x1000 canvas was 4MB  My first PC had a 20 MB HDD and 640x480 EGA graphics.  Incredible to think that that computer couldn't really have managed to run a single-player place, and now we can sling those 4meg arrays around to 100,000 people around the entire world, simultaneously, on their phones. In computing terms I'm living the life my grandma, born before Wright bros, did in aeronautical terms.  Wonder what my moon landing will be

What software development methodology did you use? Agile or waterfall? What was the time frame (how long did it took)? I need this info for my homework :(  
We actually use a intricate system of tracking individual contributors' stress levels in a spreadsheet.  If an individual's stress levels are too high, relative to the ship date, we'd address the cause of the stress. Stress levels for Place over development time.  
This is really interesting; I've never heard of a project management style like this. Did you adapt it from somewhere? How has it been working?  
I think we kind of just made it up as a joke but it was pretty useful!  
It's fascinating that you rate stress on a 10-point scale from 0-9, like true programmers, instead of from 1-10.  
They are from 0-10.  I just don't graph good.  u/bsimpson is always at a cool zero.  
I use this, too. But instead of addressing the cause of it, I usually just turn my phone and internet off and refuse to see another person for at least a week.  
As an inspiring software developer I love write ups like this.  Kudos to you guys.

Maybe they just think highly of themselves?  
This is why I don't have a job.  
Maybe you can get a job as a motivational speaker.  
 The project must be designed in such a way that it‚Äôs unlikely to affect the rest of the site‚Äôs normal function  Too soon man.... rip ccKufi ;_;  
Could you explain?  
Reddit's april fools thing last year was Reddit Robin. Basically you start off in a chat room of 2 people including you, and if the majority of the chat room votes to GROW (rather than ABANDON), the chat room gets merged with a chat room of the same tier, and all people who voted to ABANDON or didn't vote get kicked out. And there's a time limit, if there isn't a majority within the time limit, the room gets dissolved. If there is a majority GROW, but if there isn't another room of the same tier, you have to wait until a room of the same tier gets created. There was also the option to vote to STAY, if the majority votes STAY a private subreddit gets created with all the people in the room added as approved submitters. The tier number, starting from 1, is determined by the number of times the room has merged with another. The name of the chat room is determined by the first two letters of each person in the list of users in the room. ccKufiPrFaShleWoli0 (ccKufi) was the first a tier 17 room and it had several thousand people in it. There were lots of bots and people chatting so there'd be at least a couple hundred messages per minute. I was there and it was pretty much chaos and shitposting, loads of fun. But ccKufi was too big and was causing increased error rates across the entire website so the admins shut it down before ccKufi's time limit could reach 0. Lots of people were upset because ccKufi took a lot of rooms and more than an entire week to form; also there was only 10-ish minutes left on the time limit and we wanted to vote to STAY to get our special subreddit. The admins gave us the subreddit anyways. RIP ccKufi. Edit: if interested, you can see a tree diagram of most of the rooms here  
Whoops  
Awesome of you to share all of this with us, thanks!  
I'm late, so this will be buried. But, I wanted to say thank you to all the team that brought us r/place. You put in a lot of work building and supporting this gift to us so that we could enjoy it. Very much appreciated.  
Glad you enjoyed it!  
Am I the only CS student who read this blog post and was like wtf how and when do I get to understand this stuff?  
Nope, i answered another one above. The catch is that CS teaches you the fundamentals, but learning how to apply them (and what tools already implement them) changes all the time and just needs research, experience, and asking people who know more in a particular area.  
A lot of the stuff here is less programming, and more higher level structure and tools. For instance, I doubt you'll ever hear of Redis in a university level programming class, but it's one of those ubiquitous tools in the industry that I'm sure you'll have to learn at some point. There's not much algorithmically interesting stuff going on here (and that's what university classes usually focus on). There's a lot of networking though! If you have any networking classes, I would definitely recommend taking some.  
I am graduating this year and I understood pretty much all of it. But I wouldn't say this is because of my academic background, but has more to do with the stuff I do outside of class. Learning real world applications, isn't done in class but.. in the real world. Trying different things, reading up on blogposts exatly like these and in general having a curious mind is the way to learn these kinds of things.  
You understand this stuff by reading posts like this, and then deploying the source code, and then modifying it to do something different (something small) and doing research on everything you don't understand on the way.  
I'd like to work for reddit at some point once I properly learn how to code etc.   
 And if you‚Äôre interested in working on projects like Place in the future,¬†we‚Äôre hiring!  My first thought was what a great job that would be, as a programmer living in the region. Then I realized how my post history was likely to be scrutinized - - possibly even the deleted stuff - - and I gave up on that dream.   
Just FYI as someone who used to work at reddit and has great things to say about it: you never have to share your username during the application process and can create an alt when you join. Many folks have done that for a bunch of different reasons. You should apply!  
Thanks for the encouragement! I like to keep my professional face at work, while the anonymity of my reddit account allows me to be a little more candid than I tend to be in person.  
<3 u/umbrae. We miss you!  
Interesting. Do you think the RabbitMQ management API is worth replacing on a more permanent basis with something else? We also struggle with slow rabbit management calls and are worried about visibility during load.  
I think we're going to try out some newer versions before abandoning it altogether; the changelog notes a lot of performance improvements after the version we're on. But yeah, if it can't keep up we'll probably have to figure something else out.  
Does anyone remember a website from years(10+ years) that was literally /r/place but with large circular canvases?   
[deleted]  
It's pretty brilliant And going from the button to Robin to this seems like a brilliant evolution to understand the limits and anticipate use going into R/place Was it all planned? Or just brilliant chaos  
I wish there was a large and strong international white hat/it security institution that could back this kid up. He did the right thing. Found a flaw, verified it and reported it. We need to throw our weight in and cover each other when someone gets targeted like this, just because some fucking ego was scuffed.  
EFF is about as close as you'll get.   
CCC might be a better choice. It's a German Hacker Institution. So they might be actually in a position to do something.  
I can imagine that conversation. CCC: "Hi, we're with the CCC and wish to set up a meeting about an important policy matter. We are a well-respected eingetragener Verein with great expertise." Office: "Wonderful. Let me just find an open times here. Ah, here we go. What does CCC stand for, now?" CCC: "Chaos Computer Club." CCC: "Hello?"   
I'd think more along the lines. CCC: "hey we got contacts to some great lawyers there regarding the matter. Let's send him some help."  
They are actually on the lobby list of the German parliament  and are advising on it security matters quite regularly. Nice meme though ;)   
Eh, they've received a good bit of media attention in Germany so at least in the industry they're known  
The CCC is quite well respected. Not every politician likes them, but they have an overall good reputation. It's the closest thing Germany has to the EFF. Also, they are becoming economically important, as they host the most important hacking / security conference in Germany. Plus, they have a lot of expertise when it comes to dealing with legal issues after greyhat / whitehat activities.   
They do this kind of stuff and help people with responsible disclosure in Germany (because they have 35 years of experience with this kind of stuff and actually had their members and members of the german hacker community get into serious trouble because there wasn't anybody to turn to in these cases in the past). They are well respected in Germany these days (actually being asked for their opinion on it-security isssues by the german government and all mainstream media) and would probably try to do their best to help out hackers in other countries, if they got the ressources at the time. They at least could tell you the best way to handle it, even if they wouldn't be able to do the disclosure themselves.  
 EFF  They‚Äôre great, hats off to them. But nevertheless, they‚Äôre a focused on the US which makes them less of a choice for Europe. We‚Äôd need an equivalent organization that understands local law and jurisdictions, cooperating on the level of at least the entire EU.  
Maybe fsfe.org?   
Totally unrelated but I accidentally found the EFF's office in San Francisco one time. I was looking for a restaurant nearby and happened to see a ton of EFF signs all over a wall and realized that it was their office. Too bad it was on a Saturday, I might have wandered in to say thanks.

We need laws that cover this shit. If you find and report a vulnerability properly you can't be sued or held liable for damages, on the other hand you are not allowed to disclose your findings to the general public or a 3rd party during a 30 day period.  
I'd go further and have a "pay to delay" schedule that doubles every 30 days.  Want to delay disclosure 30 more days?  No problem: That'll be a $500 fee paid to the discoverer.  30 more days?  $1000.  30 more days?  $2000.  Until they stop paying to avoid disclosure. Multiple parties discovered the same vulnerability?  Well, get ready to pay them all every 30 days after they disclosed it to you according to the fee schedule! People could and should make a living doing this sort of thing.  
Now that would just be an exploit. One needs only secretly share that information with numerous contacts and have them all nail the company with the "pay to delay" charge. Those contacts would of course either pay the original party a cut of what the first payment would be, or they'd agree to pay an increasing cut each 30 days until the vulnerability is disclosed.  
What you're* describing is collusion and is already quite illegal. Wouldn't imagine a law that didn't account for this kind of behavior, including serious penalties/jail time.  Then again, if the company didn't want to go to the length of fighting all these people, could they not - I don't know - fix the exploit? Paying the discoverer(s) aside, these seem like common sense good Samaritan laws that should be on the books.   
That sounds like literal extortion. I can see what you're going for, but that's still extortion. At the very least give companies like 30-60 days for free, FFS.  
That's more or less Google's policy. When they discover a security flaw in another company's product, that company normally gets 90 days to fix it before Google makes a public announcement (although they've been known to give as little as 10 days' warning for issues they consider especially urgent). Of course, Google does not have a policy of letting people buy more time. I can't say for sure it doesn't happen, but if it does, it happens in secret.  
$500 sounds fair. We have to remember that we're competing with criminals here, people who might pay quite a bit more than $500 for an exploit like that.   
Cue startups going bankrupt in a fortnight.  
Nahh.  Startups don't have massive, legacy code bases that are impossible to fix within half a year.  They'll have more than enough time in the initial 30 days to fix the problem.  If not, oh well.  
 just because some fucking ego was scuffed.   Well in this case it's not just ego getting scuffed, the system is so amazingly bad you're looking at gross negligence charges for the T-System Hungary executives and "engineers" and some people at the BKK as well. I assume Hungary has some similar laws regarding this. Not saying it's right, just that I'm not terribly surprised that these sorts of criminals would be willing to throw someone under the bus to save themselves.   
Just like good Samaritan laws but for software.  
Why did he even need to report it?  Is using browser tools to edit values even hacking at all? I'm not sure he did ANYTHING illegal.   
Depending on the letter of the law, there's a significant case to be made for theft, fraud, etc. It doesn't matter that he contacted them and had them cancel his pass; the fact that he obtained the pass in the first place could be considered an illegal act. To use an analogy to brick-and-mortar stores, imagine if a shop had an entry door and an exit door, and only set up anti-theft devices at the exit door. If you grab an item, then walk out the entry door without paying for it, it could legally be considered shoplifting, even if you immediately walk back in to give the item back and tell them their security sucks. It would be a dick move for them to call the police, and even more of a dick move for the police to arrest you and the courts to press charges, but it would all be within the letter of the law (in our hypothetical situation where the law is written that way).  
I think your analogy is flawed. It's more like he checked out told the cashier it was $.50 instead of $30 and the cashier said yup that's correct and let him walk out the front door. It's not his fault they didn't say no it's $30.  
My analogy was intended to be more about the fact that his good-faith effort to let them know about it doesn't necessarily affect the legality of what he did. You're right that it doesn't really work very well for discussing the legality of the initial bug discovery.  
[deleted]  
Yeah, you're right, that's probably a better example. I was just trying to get at the fact that immediately reporting it and making it clear he doesn't want to profit off of it doesn't necessarily make it not illegal.  
 They started to talk about [...] how the society wasn't acting like grown ups [...] that people were using indecent names for registration  Must be this company's first time on the internet, huh?  
Considering they didn't even have an HTTP redirect it sure seems that way.  
I know a similar case in Spain Basically, Sevilla Transport had an APP with schedule's information. The app was awful as hell, so a young student decides create his own app. His app was a complete success, beating the original. Just contrast the difference at the picture of below:  https://i.blogs.es/e9d80e/tumblr_inline_okoz72fiyj1qbxxsf_540/1366_2000.png (left: original, right: made by the student).   Sevilla transport authority was ashamed by a young boy! That couldn't happen, so they sue criminal charges against him: Hacking security measures, plagiarism... These charges didn't have any fucking sense, but the author didn't want take the risk for a free app. So he deleted it of the market place.  
[deleted]  
Given how things work in Spain, I would bet that the government of Sevilla sub-contracted a shitty contractor company (C√°rnicas or Meat Grinders due the high turnover and burnout rates and low prices and salaries) to do the work and they delivered the minimal shitty available app possible. They wouldn't offer him a job  because, first, they probably weren't even hiring on the first place, second, the contracting company most probably finished the contract after delivering (Or maybe after delivering, providing a bit of support and had their contract removed after other shitty contractor company bid less money for the maintenance), and third, either the contracting company wasn't hiring people with no degree or just they weren't interested in someone who actually had technical knowledge. Source: I'm a spaniard and I've been working for one of those contractor companies for a while.  
That's not just Spain, that's software contracting in general, both public and private sectors.  
This doesn't ease my mind at all :( Still, at least for what I read around here it seems our market is flooded even more with shitty contractors than companies that actually deliver a product.   
And the company is probably owned by a member of the PP or their family :P   
Not necessarily. Most part of the private sector does not have blood ties with any political party. Over two years ago, there was an investigation from I-don't-recall-which-competence-organism regarding the biggest companies on Spain agreeing on not compete between them. Also, most of workings towards an actual contract are designed to avoid an actual, real bidding (usually through tailor-made requirements), so you got that. Corruption does not need anyone from the PP to breed. It just needs money and lack of accountability.  
Can't speak about Spanish govt but over here the pay when working in public sector is waaay below private.  
The company responsible is a private company.  
Oh, in Spain is in the other way around. Public jobs are desired against private sector. The labour market here is really shitty, only the public system has "normal" conditions.  
The pay is. The contracts with private companies (because the public sector isn't all powerful) are a different and corrupt matter.  
Fuck that. He should've gave them the finger. That's public information so they can lick my balls and speak to my lawyer.  
I'm not paying a lawyer over a free app. Threats work.  
You will be refunded later when you win. The problem is that you need to pay in advance...  
The structure and organization of public information is copyrighted under EU law, if it is non-trivial. For instance, a collection album of public domain songs.  
I find it hard to believe that public transit information would be illegal to share and that there would be no legal recourse for this developer to follow.  
Whats with all public transport companies?  A friend of mine created the an app for the public transport in Sofia, Bulgaria. The first on the market.  The transport company had only an unusable web interface. When they head about it, they send cease and desist letter. It did not work so they tried to buy the app. It's MIT project on github, so that did not work to.   At the end they just added a captcha to the web interface.   
[deleted]  
My friend did a similar thing in The Netherlands as a young app developer, and then the transport company met with him and paid him good money to develop it.   
Well the Netherlands are on the next level. It's the best public transport experience I've ever had.   
This is what I don't get‚Äîwhy are some bureaucracies so inept/corrupt while others aren't? I see this all over California. There are brilliant, hardworking people all over the place but the administrations I deal with are just awe-inspiringly incompetent. (I should say "faux-competent", because although their actions appear incompetent to experts they're certainly justified with pretty charts, graphs, and strategy documents. Same thing in Chicago.)  
 What's with all public transport companies?  Not all of them üòÅ https://ruter.no/labs/ üá≥üá¥  
Same for the NYC MTA http://datamine.mta.info/  
Was the original app also free?  
Yes.  
Why on earth they would go through the money and effort of pressing charges against this kid, instead of negotiating a deal to acquire his app, is beyond me.   
Actually, they didn't formalize it. Just threat him with pressing charges, that has a cost of zero.  
Probably because the official app is being developed for good money, and those people and their buddies in the administration don't want to lose those contracts.  
I'm using a free Android app named "Offi" developed by a long-time local Android enthusiast here in Berlin. Over the course of several years, he has extended the app from supporting primarily Berlin to a vast amount of networks all over Germany, Europe and the world. It is absolutely comprehensive, and feature-rich, and still, there are several public transportation companies that have contacted him not to include them in the app and not to consume their APIs. So sad.  
If you don't want me to consume your api then you need to secure it with api keys. That's like putting up a billboard that tells people not to read it.   
 That's like putting up a billboard that tells people not to read it  That is a great analogy!  
Fucking dinosaurs. Probably think that if Offi accesses their data, then it'll "have" all their data, and they won't "have it" any more.  
From bash.org: <NES> lol <NES> I download something from Napster <NES> And the same guy I downloaded it from starts      downloading it from me when I'm done <NES> I message him and say "What are you doing?      I just got that from you" <NES> "getting my song back fucker"  (I hope the link is right. bash.org is blocked at my workplace.)  
The link is right. Ohhh bash.org  
I love Offi. I've never tried it in other cities, but I use it every day here in Berlin. The one thing I wish you could do is Google search locations. If I could put a destination as simply "Neue Heimat" or something, then it would be perfect. As it is right now, you need to already know what the nearest train station is.  
I'm grateful we have open data in my city. We can have an unofficial user-friendly (and open source) app made with material design instead of the barely usable official app. We still have to use the official one for tickets tho.  
Happened also in Reykjav√≠k for our bus app. Outsourced some crap for millions, got beat by a student making a free app and sued.  
It doesnt surprise me at all, the spanish government and the public services dont value technology nor developers at all and everything here is arcaic, and in most national companies the people a t the top of IT departments tend to be friends of the company president/director and tend to be old guys who have no idea what they are doing or how to allocate people and budget. Thats mostly a cultural problem and I saw it at 2 companies I used to work for, "why bother improving if we have been the national market leaders for X years" seems to be what these people think. Lucky us it doesnt happen everywhere, 2 years ago I was hired for a 1 year project at an IT consulting firm and my manager who didnt keep up with technological changes acknowledged that and had all of the team members (even new people like me) chip in when decisions needed to be made because he knew that everyone had some expertise in something that the other people lacked, imo that was good leadership and we had good results.  
Hahaha, super secure!  someone found out that the admin password was adminadmin and managed to log in using that.   
I use that as a password for a webapp I'm developing and testing on my laptop.  Maybe they just changed some NAT rules and called it production.  
[deleted]  
admin [tab] adminadmin  
The name's admin. adminadmin.  
That was my high schools password, and the administration got really upset that students knew about it and tried to find the teacher who told the kids.... As if anyone had to tell us such an obvious Password.   
I'm usually in favor of responsible disclosure, but holy shit:  the system stored the passwords in clear text and it emailed it to you if you asked for a password reminder.... someone found out that the admin password was adminadmin and managed to log in using that.... He just used the developer tools in the browser, that everybody has access to, saw that the price was being sent back to the server when he was about to make a purchase, and tried if he could change it....   
There's always one developer on the team who doesn't care about this sort of thing, and the others have to pick up after them and make sure everything is done properly. This must be what happens when everyone on the team is the bad developer.  
I'd guess although they didn't have the understanding to know better, they just implemented what management asked for, including taking the short-cuts management demanded.  
It was T-Systems. A company with millions, if not billions of dollars/euros to spend on experienced developers. They got payed very well for that piece of shit software they created. I'd kind of get it if was an app or webservice developed by one dude in his free time. But these kind of fuckups on this level by an established company like T-Systems is just inexcusable.  
Someone finding the admin password is beyond bad, but that in combination to passwords being plain text? I sincerely hope most people realized how awful that site was quickly and refused to use it.  
Author here: indeed I wanted to see it, but stopped registering upon hearing the news. (At first I abandoned in anger because they have disabled pasting into the password field. Which, you know, makes using random unique passwords a pain.) Still they had something like 5000 subscribers.  
 the system stored the passwords in clear text and it emailed it to you if you asked for a password reminder....  My (very small, local) credit union does this; I just found out. To whom can I report this? I emailed them but I've gotten no response.  
if youve reported the issue to them and they havent acted go to your local newspaper/radio etc. and explain to them what is happening and why this is bad. if youre lucky youll get more exposure amd therefore more preassure for the credit union to fix their shit  
 they earlier talked about how this was not ethical hacking because no one asked the guy to do it  That's not what "ethical hacking" means.  
For some, ethical hacking requires agreement with the target. This is to avoid risking perturbations of the service, etc. during the hacking attempt. As for the law (in most countries), it's a requirement. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security)#Legality_in_the_UK  Edit: playing devil's advocate, here's some reason that are pro-"don't hack if your target doesn't agree to be hacked":  as said, the hacker could disturb the service during his/her hack. And even cause huge damage (like, wiping or corrupting the production database). Even if no actual damage occur, even if the hack failed, the company may spend a large amount of worker-time (thus money) to analyze afterwards the attack and makes sure no damage was done (they will likely not know the attacker was a white hat, nor the extend of the hack) any lawsuit against someone trying to intrude your network would become useless. "I was trying to see if it could be hacked!" said the nephew of your competitor. it could happen at the wrong time, like right before a migration to a safer system. "Ok, you've shown previous system was terrible at security, but we were in the middle of changing it. Now the new system is up and running, we would have prefer this new system to be pen-tested". if a hacker manage to penetrate a system containing sensitive data (like SSN, medical records), you would still have someone getting unauthorized access to sensitive data - which is bad in itself.   Ofc there are good things about having hacker trying to penetrate networks - it forced the hands of bad actors, or at least expose them. But we need to weight the pro and the cons. Or make another law altogether, like "any system that matches those criteria [public sensitive data, yadda yadda] needs to host honey pots that mimics their internals for public target practice" (ofc, problem would be the cost due to additional planning/world/infrastructure).  
Probably in the dictionary there can be room for two distinct phrases "ethical hacking" and "legal hacking".  
I wonder if "ethical hacking" is a legal term.  
In Mexico City, most public transportation APIs are open an citizens encouraged to build things on top of them. http://datos.labcd.mx/apis  
Huh, so we're doing something well for once? I'll take it!   
In Denmark you will might get reported to the police if you find bugs in sites, even if its ssn from the entire population,and no harm was done...  Edit: Basicly a tech guy found a vuln in a gov site(created and maintained by third party) , that allowed ssn lookup (also automated lookup / person and name). The guy reported it to the firm gov, which said it was not a vuln. Basicly dismissing it.  He then contacted the press, which brought the story.  The following days, the firm, which has the bug, contacted the tech guy's boss and told that his employee had hacked them and asked if they were aware. After that, they filed a report for hacking. Poor tech guy.  All he did was finding a severe bug, report it correctly, then gets a report.  So yeah. Atleast theres that.....  Edit2: this is a interview with the tech guy (in danish, use translate.google.com) https://www.version2.dk/artikel/interview-hacker-tiltalt-jeg-totalt-uskyldig-1077581  
Similar to the Facebook response: BBC journalists who were highlighting sexualised images of children to the Facebook admin team were reported to the police.  
Haha omg I hope as journalists they were properly protected...   
Which is why I'd never report bugs to a company without a public bounty program. It means they do not give a fuck about security and will instead try to silence you by any means necessary. Better get that bounty on the dark & high seas.  
I have a couple of rules for things like this that I think are pretty reasonable:  Is it a bug in open source software (free or not)?  Disclose it right away (using secure methods if possible).  Fix it too if possible. Is it a bug in closed, proprietary software?  If they don't have a bounty I just put it in "my file" (I have a special place where I store vulnerabilities and knowledge of them). Is it Sony, Comcast, or Verizon?  They can suck it.  Start with loud, public disclosure because... Fuck them.  I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if it turned out they were funding ISIS, "just to spread the evil."   
I get Comcast and Verizon, but what has Sony done? They make pretty good TVs and have some good games on their console but I don't know much else about them.  
Sony has a long history of bad behavior and there's zero evidence they have changed.  The rootkit scandal started it all for me: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal Consistent evil behavior involving the DMCA, the CFAA, and similar.  Most famous example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment_America,_Inc._v._Hotz Loads of bad behavior lead up to their hack in 2014 and continued afterwards: http://www.vulture.com/2014/12/everything-sony-leaks-scandal.html (loads of great info on the company's behavior in that single incident thanks to the leaks) This year Sony (along with Apple and Samsung) have been accused of using child labor in sourcing of minerals used to manufacture their products.  Apple's response: "If this is true this is unacceptable.  We'll fix it!".  Samsung's response: "We have a zero-tolerance policy for child labor.  We're looking into it."  Sony's response?  "It's the suppliers fault!  We're going to inquire with them..." Apparently they also have a culture of sexism (which is sadly common for big Japanese companies): http://variety.com/2017/music/news/l-a-reid-music-industry-sexual-harassment-1202426743/  There's more but that's all I can remember off the top of my head.  
Look up Sony rootkit drm for a start. Then there's the C&D for Linux on PS3, they tried to make sharing the private boot signing keys illegal. They are scum.   
Is that not the advice given in other countries? Don't report ANYTHING unless you are paid to do so? Thats the advice I got in college, programming boot camp, and at work.  
When you say "dark & high seas", are you suggesting selling the knowledge about the vulnerability to people with less than good intentions?   
Your words, not mine :) What happens after disclosure (for $$$) to said people is none of my concern. Rent isn't gonna pay itself.  
Well, that tears it. If I find a vulnerability in someone's system, I won't even try to warn them about it, I'll just abuse the hell out of it. That way I can go to jail content in that I at least wronged someone with my unauthorized information system access.  
Gonna be interesting in court, but i agree with you.   
 A monthly pass costs 9500HUF (about 30EUR) and he modified the price to 50HUF.   What they don't describe, that it wasn't some evil hack, he only changed the value in the HTML dom.  
I don't mean to be a dick, but how are these people software developers?  
Well, my guess is that they aren't.  They are business man and accountants.  The outsourced the project (or at least parts of it) to the company who was willing to do it the cheapest.  
They outsourced it to T-Systems, subsidiary of T-Mobile. Not a group of idiots‚Ä¶ supposedly.   
If they were competent they'd be working on T-Mobile's own software rather then being farmed out to clients.  
I'm going to bet my left testicle that it got further outsourced at least another 5 times until some high school dropout completed the work on his own for ‚Ç¨4/hour   
T-Systems's  reputation is not very good. They are also known to outsource job. And by the previous comment i was referring to T-Systems , not BKK  
gotta love no server side validation, i wonder what would have happened with negative values, let's charge -1,000,000HUF...  
No server side validation and, more bafflingly, why on earth would you send the price to the server from the client in the first place?  
This has happened before. Or at least I've heard of a story where the price couldn't be changed, but the amount of a product in a webshop could be negative. That way the total price of products could cancel out and become nearly nothing. The people in the warehouse didn't understand why the amount would be negative so they just packed that positive amount of stuff in a box and shipped it.   
[deleted]  
Probably not. My guess is it'd try to charge a negative amount, their payment gateway will throw an exception, and their app will bork.   
With this method they probably also managed to access other accounts  
Yup, the website was a plain text offender, so I guess the payment informations were similarly secured.  
On the subject, they are open to the simplest of social engineering. If you know someones email address, you can get their account deleted.  One journalist, who registered to the website, and after hearing how secure is this thing, emailed the company to delete all of his data that is under x@x.com email address. They did exactly that. The only problem where that he used a different email address to send the request. This is very very bad. Especially , all your existing licences and passes are stored there, so in theory someone could loose a lot of money, if they opt for a yearly pass.  
To those not understanding, he pressed 'F12' in Chrome and changed a number. Then hit 'submit'.  
 What they don't describe, that it wasn't some evil hack, he only changed the value in the HTML dom.  They described it in the sentence immediately preceding the one you quoted:  He just used the developer tools in the browser, that everybody has access to, saw that the price was being sent back to the server when he was about to make a purchase, and tried if he could change it.    
This dumpster fire took them 4 years and 9 million EUR??? What. The. Fuck.

T-Systems AT work. Ayyy lmao  
I see this all of the time in the us. I know that these websites that they charge millions for, I know a couple good devs could get it done in a few months. I really wonder how these contracts are given out sometimes.  
two entirely different things, the NFC card based e-ticket system has been in "development" for 4 years the online store was developed in a matter of days/weeks as an afterthought for the Aquatics Championship in Budapest.  
Hey, noob programmer here: I'll take the 9 million and produce a better app. I'll have it done when I'm finished with my degree in 3 years.  
You're probably far along enough now to do it in a weekend or two  
Give me 20 min.  
storing and mailing passwords in plain text alone is such an amateur mistake and they got paid 9 million for this train wreck   
Step 1: Throw out a seemingly high bid. Step 2: Win bid Step 3: Panic and get a 2 year programming degree Step 4: ???? Step 5: Profit 8,998,000‚Ç¨  
That was my exact reaction. I could build the system myself in 4-6 months.  Give me a few engineers and I'll have a beta in one. ...And I would have a system much more hardened than theirs...  
I built my web development business up a few years ago and started pitching for a few small government RFPs; most of the time I couldn't come up with quotes high enough to be considered!  Like, I was gonna go in with ¬£10k, making a healthy profit, and the budget range they were asking for was ¬£50k-¬£150k.  Most of the jobs went to big companies who then immediately sub-contracted it out after pocketing the majority of the cash.  
I think that's just how the cookie crumbles.  Any cheaper and you don't appear legitimate. I worked for a small contracting company and learned, as I left, that the CEO was pitching astronomical figures for quotes.  She was giving me advice since I was starting up my own dev firm and told me to ask her anything... so I did. Solely because of me, we were able to get a huge contract with a very well-known tech company.  I did 80% of the work on this contract, from admin to graphics to full-stack work.  After all the POs were summed up, we had been paid $2,300,000 (USD).  This included planning, development, hardware, and a maintenance package. That project in particular took me four months, for which I was compensated a measly $17,000. Fuck that place; glad I'm out.  
My brother in law got into a similar situation, when he reported numerous vulnerabilities that his high school network had. But that was a long time ago, social networks were not in place to ridicule the administration.  
In my city a student found a vulnerability on the bus tickets (they use NFC)  that basically let you go for unlimited travels, he was awarded a prize.  
Was that prize unlimited travel?  
I don't remember, but that would make sense.  
The people responsible for the ticket system should be arrested. Releasing such a insecure leaky cobbled together program shows the disrespect for consumers, they should've known better.   
This just in: disrespect is now illegal. This is one of the cases where even I think the market will solve it.  
There is no free market on public transport. At worst you end up with a monopoly, at best with a oligopoly. Very few companies in this world have the scope and capital to disrupt existing public transportation networks of busses, trams, and possibly underground trains.  
Transportation is usually publicly run because it is run at a loss with public subsidy making up the gap. That's not exactly something private companies are clamoring to get into.  
I dunno, I'm in Belgrade and public transportation companies here are killing it. Of course, the citizens are complaining about ridiculously high prices that are unavoidable because they have a fucking monopoly, but hey, who gives a fuck what citizens want?  
too busy making different kinds of fidget spinners  
Market will not solve it, a city bus system is a monopoly run by the state or delegated by the state to one company (which probably acquired it via corruption). Lowest and highest bidders get thrown out and then this happens.  
then they wonder why people just exploit their shitty systems instead of 'reporting' the bugs to them   
This is how black hats are born.  
[deleted]  
Lesson to be learned here: don't report the security holes to the people who can fix them; go dark instead, and share them with the world to maximize damage. Find a mechanism by which you could cripple the country's transportation infrastructure? Sure, you could notify BKK and go to jail, but then again, ISIS or another agent would pay good money for such an exploit... At least, that's what BKK is apparently suggesting, by their actions.  
That will teach him not to do the right thing. Next time I'm sure he'll sell the info to the highest bidders.  Seriously though, there really needs to be some sort of international organization that could be used to pass bugs/exploits to the correct parties anonymously and shame them publicly if they don't act in an appropriate amount of time.   
link to hacker news discussion  
 the system stored the passwords in clear text and it emailed it to you if you asked for a password reminder  this is such an amazingly stupid idea. how do people not code their pw DBs with salted hashes nowadays its just amazing   
This is why I always recommand people to not report security issues unless the service has detailed information about reporting these things. It doesn't have to be a bug bounty program, just some form of proof that they actually understand the whole thing about security issues. There is also the option of disclosing the issue anonymously (via respectable outlets or on hacker boards, that's your choice). But this way you won't get credit for finding the issue so personally I feel ripped off.  
I wanted to see if they were still vulnerable so I googled Budapest e-ticket and I came across this site: http://budapestblog.luxuryhotelsbudapest.com/how-to-buy-hungarian-train-tickets/  First of all, your browser may find the official online train purchase system of the Hungarian MAV untrustworthy and you may get a warning  ...  Apparently they had a non-working certificate long enough for travel blogs to start warning people about it.  
This encourages otherwise ethical hackers to report any found exploits to less-than-ethical parties. Punished for doing the right thing vs. paid for doing the wrong thing.  
The issue here is that it's handled by people who don't understand. In the link he found a way to pay a different price, and we all know that's due to the companies incompetence. They were doing verification client side. But the business side will think he's hacked their site, and trying to spread how to hack them.  
9M‚Ç¨, isn't there a corruption issue in this country, i vaguely remember having read something about this, and even at very high levels like Europe money that disappear.  
[deleted]  
Well, i can even give you an example. Right now, the FINA water sports world championship is taking place in Budapest. They build the tower jumping platform from 10M‚Ç¨. As for a reference, that is more then 8 times as much as the last one cost, on the previous world championship. The whole thing cost us 420M‚Ç¨. The original estimate for the cost was an order of magnitude less. Now tell me there is no rampant corruption here.  
This is why you don't report bugs, you sell them.   
Okay, what the FUCK is with scrolling on that site?  
That's all you. Don't look like that for me  
The guy didn't even have illegal access to a system -- he didn't touch anything that wasn't given to his own machine!

Reminds me of this  It is more important that innocence be protected than it is that guilt be punished, for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished. But if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned, perhaps to die, then the citizen will say, ‚Äúwhether I do good or whether I do evil is immaterial, for innocence itself is no protection,‚Äù and if such an idea as that were to take hold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end of security whatsoever. -John Adams   
In developer culture this is considered a d*** move.  
Shit load of public money, to develop city infrastructure software that was hacked by a citizen, exploding a bug introduced by an non skilled software developer. This screams public found embezzlement. This is a corruption case.  
Is it just me (or rather, my version of Firefox), or is the site's eye-candy scroll effect broken enough to render parts of the article unreadable?

This was my nightmare about 10 years ago when I found (and accidentally exploited) a bug in a US cellular provider that let you do the same thing (name your own price), and I remarked that even then this type of bug was ancient and should not be happening. I was paranoid for months that the cops were going to show up, because I didn't mean to exploit it (but I did, got a couple months of service for $2, and their billing department insisted that no this is correct when I tried to arrange to pay the difference), their system went out of it's way to help me exploit it by storing the poisoned price data to a fucking cookie that kept it even after I restarted the process legitimately!  
And even after all this, the Budapest transit system doesn't have automated turnstiles or anything. You get a printout that you show to a guy standing by the escalator who tries to glance at it while you and hundreds of other people are pushing into the station. Often there's nobody there. On line M1 it's surprising if you get checked once a week.  
The title is completely overblown. What actually happened is much, much simpler:  And a week later the news broke out that he was taken from his home by the police in the early morning and taken to custody. (He was released after a few hours.)  Literally, the police came to question him because there was a massive public outcry and they wanted to ensure that there wasn't anything nefarious going on. He wasn't "arrested", he wasn't even detained, and he certainly hasn't been charged with a crime.  Are we really getting up in arms over completely non-technically literate police officers doing their basic due diligence?   
 He wasn't "arrested", he wasn't even detained  I don't want to argue right or wrong, but "taken to custody" is definitely at least detention, assuming that description is accurate to what happened.  
How is "taken to custody" by the police not an arrest or being detained? I do agree that the police didn't really do much wrong here.  They were told that this person hacked a government site, they arrested him, questioned him and then released him once they realized the story they were given was a load of BS.  
Hungarian here. He was detained, as a suspect for a crime ("violation of an IT system or data"), for hearing. Some consider that what he did wasn't even a crime since he only exposed a vulnerability of the system, reported it instantly, didn't use the pass (he lives some 300km from Budapest), therefore there was no harm done and no ill intent on his part either. But that's only part of the problem. If the police wants you for hearing (as a witness, perhaps, more appropriate in this situation, but even as a suspect), they can send you a letter or call you and say "come on down to the police station 2pm Tuesday, we want to talk to you". They don't normally knock on your door early morning, as well they can't -- the use any coercive measure (including taking you to the police station from your home right now ) must be in accordance with the "crime" and the danger you pose to society; and can only be done if the police thinks there's a danger of you fleeing, hiding, repeating the crime or influencing witnesses. Since obviously none of those conditions were met for this 18yo guy, yes, many do think it was just an act of intimidation on the part of the police.  
Actually that whole paragraph says a lot more    And a week later the news broke out that he was taken from his home by the police in the early morning and taken to custody. (He was released after a few hours.) Now, of course, in a normal country, in a well functioning democracy whoever reports a suspected crime is not responsible for whatever the police does afterwards. (Even if that's totally assholish and amateurish from their part to do so, instead of saying thank you and maybe giving a small bounty.) But in such a country the police doesn't raid the house to catch someone who is not dangerous to the society. Especially if it's not legal. And in Hungary, according to the law, this was pretty much illegal. The only reason they did this is to threaten.  They did this to threaten. I think the intentions were pretty clear here.  
Being taken against your will is being arrested.  
I picture this individual getting back home from a full day of work at a boutique furniture store, putting a vinyl of Earth Wind and Fire on, pouring themselves a full glass of wine, and just fucking going at answering SQL questions until the early hours.  
The man is the head of an analytics department at the New York Times, a professor at Columbia, and owns an analytics consulting company. He fits that profile to a tee.  
He also literally wrote a book on SQL. Several of them, actually. And on datamining as well. https://www.amazon.com/s?rh=p_27%3AGordon+S.+Linoff&ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1  
I mean it sounds like his contributions to SO basically comprise a couple books by themselves.  
Sometimes I think about publishing the teachings I give to coworkers on SQL into a book. I think I'd call the book  "Stop using UPPER/TRIM functions in the query, this prevents indexes from being utilized and the data is already sanitized so it's completely useless. I tell you this 18 times a week why do you keep doing it: Practical examples from every day life" Or maybe: "Sql: Use a goddamn explain plan before you run shit like this" (Put down your pitchforks, just having fun. My coworkers aren't very technical people, and by and large the queries they write are fine, but sometimes they come to me with like "this query has been running for 2 hours????" lol)  
Did he write any sequels?  
I didn't get this joke at first, because I pronounce "SQL" like "squirrel".

But this post is about how this author is not like that, instead, keeping himself sharp as a razor on a topic by answering questions regularly on Stack Overflow.  
The pay is so poor for writing an O'Reilly book that the only people who do it are doing it to self-promote or are fools.  
You forgot to mention his name: His name is Gordon S. Linoff.  
Figured it was apparent given the original link directed to a SO page of all his answers signed on the corner, but yes, his name is Gordon Linoff.

No no, it was.  The teacher was Gordon S. Linoff.  The student?  Albert Einstein.  
His name is Gordon S. Linoff.  
I'm surprised he still has the time to answer so many questions.  
It's probably like social media for him, as easy as retelling happy stories from college, and as intrinsically rewarding

At least StackOverflow gives you a box of stuff when you reach a certain point.  
And some amount of geek cred that's semi-useful for work.  
As someone in the top 2% who has been interviewing for jobs recently, I can say it's really worthless. The best I got was a "that's impressive! Good for you man" from an interviewer. Most of the other ones didn't even check my profile I think, although I promote it in my resume. But the worst is when the interviewer asks during 30 minutes the most basic shits about the language for which I answered 400 questions. Makes me feel like I just wasted my time.  
It‚Äôs not something I bring up in interviews. It does, however, tie to their job board, and I‚Äôve had some good offers come in from there, usually quite targeted to the tech I care about (because it goes with the answers I posted), and I have worked for a company who recruited me through there. At any rate ‚Äúsemi-useful‚Äù is not a terribly high bar :)  
Have you tried marking the interviewer's question as a duplicate and redirecting them to an existing question/answer?  
Conversely, too high an amount of karma probably indicates you're not that useful at work.  
That probably just depends on the active hours when the person is making posts.  If they held a job and we're mostly posting outside those work hours, it's nothing but cred, IMO.  
What kind of stuff?  
General swag...a mug, a shirt, some stickers, might be missing something but those are the main ones.  
Also privileges. Things like closing questions and marking questions as duplicates whenever you want.  
Yeah sadly they forgot the "ability to stop idiots closing your questions and deleting your comments" privilege.  
So like being a contributor on Maps, you get socks.  
You can use those to put bounties on your own questions so they do have some value.  
Here is his blog post on his StackOverflow activity: http://blog.data-miners.com/2014/08/an-achievement-on-stack-overflow.html "For a few months, I sporadically answered questions.  Then, in the first week of May, my Mom's younger brother passed away.  That meant lots of time hanging around family, planning the funeral, and the like.  Answering questions on Stack Overflow turned out to be a good way to get away from things.  So, I became more intent."  
 So, I became more intent.  There's something about this that hits me just right. I want to put it in the mouth of a Big Bad in a dnd campaign or something

Most of What You Read on the Internet is Written by Insane People  The largest subs see from 1% to 3% of uniques comment per month. So Reddit consists of 97-99% of users rarely contributing to the discussion, just passively consuming the content generated by the other 1-3%. This is a pretty consistent trend in Internet communities and is known as the 1% rule. But there's more, because not all the users who post do so with the same frequency. The 1% rule is of course just another way of saying that the distribution of contributions follows a Power Law Distribution, which means that the level of inequality gets more drastic as you look at smaller subsets of users.  Inequalities are also found on Wikipedia, where more than 99% of users are lurkers. According to Wikipedia's "about" page, it has only 68,000 active contributors, which is 0.2% of the 32 million unique visitors it has in the U.S. alone. Wikipedia's most active 1,000 people ‚Äî 0.003% of its users ‚Äî contribute about two-thirds of the site's edits. Wikipedia is thus even more skewed than blogs, with a 99.8‚Äì0.2‚Äì0.003 rule.    I found one [Amazon] reviewer with 20.8k reviews since 2011. That's just under 3,000 reviews per year, which comes out to around 8 per day. This man has written an average of 8 reviews on Amazon per day, all of the ones I see about books, every day for seven years. I thought it might be some bot account writing fake reviews in exchange for money, but if it is then it's a really good bot because Grady Harp is a real person whose job matches that account's description. And my skimming of some reviews looked like they were all relevant to the book, and he has the "verified purchase" tag on all of them, which also means he's probably actually reading them. The only explanation for this behavior is that he is insane. I mean, normal people don't do that. We read maybe 20 books a year, tops, and we probably don't write reviews on Amazon for all of them. There has to be something wrong with this guy. He's less prominent now, but YouTube power-user Justin Y. had a top comment on pretty much every video you clicked on for like a year. He says he spends 1-3 hours per day commenting on YouTube, finds videos by looking at the statistics section of the site to see which are spiking in popularity, and comments on a lot of videos without watching them. Maybe he's not quite insane, but he's clearly interacting the site in a way that's different than most people, essentially optimizing for comment likes. If you read reviews on Amazon, you're mostly reading reviews written by people like Grady Harp. If you read Wikipedia, you're mostly reading articles written by people like Justin Knapp. If you watch Twitch streamers, you're mostly watching people like Tyler Blevins. And if you read YouTube comments, you're mostly reading comments written by people like Justin Young. If you consume any content on the Internet, you're mostly consuming content created by people who for some reason spend most of their time and energy creating content on the Internet. And those people clearly differ from the general population in important ways.   
If you posted this comment does that make you an insane person?  
...moderately? :D  
So, that's what makes a moderator?  
I mean, there's plenty of evidence of insane moderators lol  
TIL reddit is just an insane asylum to keep us away from the normies  
 If you read Wikipedia, you're mostly reading articles written by people like..  One note on Wikipedia is that a lot of edits are semi-automated and samey, like someone reverting vandalism, fixing grammar or renaming categories. So it looks way more disproportionate than it is. You could revert 1000 vandals in a day and contribute "0 content" by that measure.  
Apparently theres (sort of) "official" bots.  Met a guy who was making one to look for some specific kind of formatting  error.  Apparently there's some kind of vetting process before such bots are allowed join the ranks.  
Yes, there a "bots" that are separate accounts that make all sorts of automated edits. But they all have one or more human maintainers/operators. To make sure they function correctly and within established guidelines, there are community approval processes in most major language Wikipedias and other sister projects. But they are not "official" and are coded and maintained by the same volunteers. They can easily make millions of edits, but the above studies did exclude them from the statistics.  
Many articles have "lords", who see an article as theirs. They will mark many things as vandalism that are not, or revert legitimate edits. Whenever you see an article that appears particularly one-sided or not very objective, check the edits and you'll see the crazy fanatic that revokes thousands of edits.  
Wikipedia, especially political topics, are very skewed towards the US though.  
That‚Äôs the English internet in general though.  
I'm sorry but no one can read 8 books a day. May  be Star Trek's Data can, but no human. It'd be physically impossible. I'm reminded of Woody Allen's joke, "I took a speed reading course and read War and Peace in an hour. It was... about Russia."  
SO has a system setup that discourages contribution from new users; not directly, not explicitly, but it's there. If you can get yourself a few thousand "points" without attracting the attention of mods or "trusted users" then you might be okay, but even then you're still on thin ice until you reach 20K. I've never tried contributing to Wikipedia, so can't speak to their system, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's similarly discouraging for new contributors.  
 I've never tried contributing to Wikipedia, so can't speak to their system, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's similarly discouraging for new contributors.  Oh, it has to be infinitely worse. Here's an actual quote from one of the Wiki admins:  ‚Äú‚Ä¶inclusionism generally is toxic. It lets a huge volume of garbage pile up. Deletionism just takes out the trash. We did it with damn Pokemon, and we‚Äôll eventually do it with junk football ‚Äòbiographies‚Äô, with ‚Äòfootball‚Äô in the sense of American and otherwise. We‚Äôll sooner or later get it done with ‚Äòpopulated places‚Äô and the like too.‚Äù   Here's a text by former admin (different one), In Defense of Inclusionism:  Wikipedia is declining, fundamentally, because of its increasingly narrow attitude as to what are acceptable topics and to what depth those topics can be explored, combined with a narrowed attitude as to what are acceptable sources, where academic & media coverage trumps any consideration of other factors. This discourages contributors‚Äîthe prerequisite for any content whatsoever‚Äîand cuts off growth; perversely, the lack of contributors becomes its own excuse for discouraging more contribution (since who will maintain it?), a self-fulfilling norm (we focus on quality over quantity here!) and drives away those with dissenting views, since unsurprisingly those who advocate more content tend to also contribute content and be driven away when their content is. One bad editor can destroy in seconds what took many years to create. The inclusionists founded Wikipedia, but the deletionists froze it. in the early days you could have things like articles on each chapter of Atlas Shrugged or each Pokemon. Even if you personally did not like Objectivism or Pokemon, you knew that you could go into just as much detail about the topics you liked best‚ÄîWikipedia was not paper! We talked idealistically about how Wikipedia could become an encyclopedia of specialist encyclopedias, the superset of encyclopedias. ‚Äúwould you expect to see a Bulbasaur article in a Pokemon encyclopedia? yes? then let‚Äôs have a Bulbasaur article‚Äù. The potential was that Wikipedia would be the summary of the Internet and books/‚Äãmedia. But now Wikipedia‚Äôs narrowing focus means, only some of what is worth knowing, about some topics. Respectable topics. Mainstream topics. Unimpeachably Encyclopedic topics.    I am not excited or interested in such a parochial project which excludes so many of my interests, which does not want me to go into great depth about even the interests it deems meritorious‚Äîand a great many other people are not excited either, especially as they begin to realize that even if you navigate the culture correctly and get your material into Wikipedia, there is far from any guarantee that your contributions will be respected, not deleted, and improved. For the amateurs and also experts who wrote wikipedia, why would they want to contribute to some place that doesn‚Äôt want them? But who really cares about what some nerds like? What matters is Notability with a capital N, and the fact that our feelings were hurt by some Wikigroaning! After all, clearly the proper way to respond to the observation that Lightsaber combat was longer than Sabre is to delete its contents and have people read the short, scrawny‚Äîbut serious!‚ÄîLightsaber article instead. If it doesn‚Äôt appear in Encarta or Encyclopedia Britannica, or isn‚Äôt treated at the same (proportional) length, then it must go!   
 inclusionism generally is toxic. It lets a huge volume of garbage pile up. Deletionism just takes out the trash. We did it with damn Pokemon, and we‚Äôll eventually do it with junk football ‚Äòbiographies‚Äô, with ‚Äòfootball‚Äô in the sense of American and otherwise. We‚Äôll sooner or later get it done with ‚Äòpopulated places‚Äô and the like too.‚Äù  Wrestling articles has to be on that list to pare down, too.  
They already did. Wikipedia used to be the foremost resources for moves and themes and then they just nuked them all.  
Ah yeah back in the day I contributed massively to Zoids entries on Wikipedia, cleaning them up, adding photos etc. Then one day the notability police came in a set them all up for deletion. The various fan wikis are way more wild west, I miss when Wikipedia could have an article for every proper noun  
Contribute to Everything2 instead.  
I had to look at Grady Harp's profile since reading and reviewing 8 books per day on average seems unsustainable. Some of his reviews feel fairly boilerplate and feel like he's selling them (they are nearly all five stars) but the sheer volume is impressive.  
Yeah, there's no way "he" is reading any of those books. Looks to me more like a business selling reviews built using a standard template. A couple of people using a template and a few blurbs about the author and the book could easily get this done. One person could as well but I feel like getting though the "Hi, I wanna buy a review on my book" emails needs more than one person and involves more work than the actual reviews.  
This makes sense. Internet content follows a pareto distribution. Although that is a very skewed one.  
that is extremely interesting and good to know about. For the content that is just for entertainment, it doesnt worry me, but for the content that is educational or for reference, it seems precarious

spent more time answering questions about SQL than USING SQL.  
SQL Error: syntax error at or near "USING"  
Sorry, USING (SQL)  
Probably a DBA at a massive company, and only has work to do a few times a year when things go wrong.  
I was offered a SQL developer job last year, and I considered just taking it, spending 6 months converting everything to EF without anybody knowing, and then just sitting back, collecting a paycheck. But they required being in office. During a pandemic. A guy on my LinkedIn was offered the job after me and left after like 3 months.  
I feel like when I wrote sql it's about getting specific data for a report. Sometimes with numerous tables and steps. Doing it in pure ef might actually make me throw up.  
Never used EF but it's just an ORM right? How would that let you not work? In my experience writing complex queries for analytics purposes (or any complex query really) is often more difficult using the ORM query abstraction that generates some SQL rather than just writing the raw SQL itself. I would think having a dedicated SQL dev position requires some more tricky tasks than just stuff like fetching some rows based on a couple of where clauses. And besides, using an ORM or not those queries won't write themselves, so there is still some work to be done, no?  
whats EF?  
Entity Framework  
"Why are all of our queries so slow?"  
According to another comment on this thread  The man is the head of an analytics department at the New York Times, a professor at Columbia, and owns an analytics consulting company. He fits that profile to a tee.  Also has written a number of sql books  
Damn - I haven't even reached 22.8 answers in 10 years there!!!  
I only have one answer but it got me a Necromancer achievement or something so I have that going for me at least.  
I have a question like that which gets me a steady stream of rep and always gives me a chuckle. It's a stupid question, but is so popular.  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19670061/bash-if-false-returns-true-instead-of-false-why  
It's so crazy that something better has not replaced sh and bash. I know why, there are a million shell scripts that need to continue working, but the best we've got is zsh, which is merely more of the same with some added features.  
I personally like fish, it breaks some compatibility with bash but has a lot of great features.  
There's https://www.nushell.sh/ which is looking pretty good. And I think actual scripting Deno/Typescript is going to be a very solid option. But yeah... I have enough trouble convincing people at work to use type annotations in Python. A lot of people are still stuck in the "If it vaguely sort of works some of the time, don't fix it. At all." zone.  
They're out there, zsh and fish, but there's a fuckload of inertia on bash. So much stuff would have to be fixed and ported.  
Arise! Arise and be answered! <tesla coils sparking> Good for you! Glad to see older questions getting some love. Especially if it happened to be one of my unanswered questions. :)  
I‚Äôve tried a few times to contribute but always give up when they ask me to get verified or whatever it is.  
Can they center a div tho?  
Horizontally or vertically? One of these centering methods tells only truth, the other will barge into your house at night, eat all your ice cream, shit on the floor and leave a note that says "fuck you" Choose carefully.

I'm wondering if it's actually a single person, or a group all using the same login. That seems more realistic.  
Nope, it's one guy. He wrote this book: https://www.amazon.com/dp/0470099518  
Great, I‚Äôm going to have nightmares now about being this guy. SQL and Excel and Data Analysis‚Ä¶ eugh  
He's owns a consulting firm and wrote a book. He most likely just tells people how they're bad at their job and collects massive cheques.

Plot twist: the algorithm was copied verbatim from SO.  
From an answer by the applicant, no doubt.  
Unfortunately, every answer was "This question has already been answered, do we have to do all the work for you?"  
I hate it so much. No the answer from 8 years ago on an old ass version is no longer relevant, and no just because they are similar doesn‚Äôt mean they are the same. I love but hate stackoverflow.  
Starting this month they're testing promoting newer answers over older accepted answers, when the newer answers start to collect a number of votes. Should make better and more modern answers more visible !  
Or make people to post the same old answer trying to get reputation.  
 I think only one answer is applicable here, really. Welcome to the club, Gordon. It was getting lonely here.     Jon Skeet   
I didn't know there were 76,000 questions that could be asked about SQL.  
There are 1000 questions and 75 000 repeats of those questions.  
The person is Gordon Linoff, a literal fucking legend!!! He saved my ass several times mainly with window functions and table expressions.  
Maybe some database became self aware, and instead of wanting to rule the world, it just wants to help answer questions.  
This guy is single-handedly propping up the entire industry.  Seriously though, he clearly has a head for data analytics and SQL. It's pretty cool of him to commit to teaching others on his own time the way he has.  
And he still has to interview  
That puts him in truly select company.  
This person is keeping the world afloat right now and nobody knows who it is - utter brilliance

I've spent a bit of time looking up SQL issues on SO over the years. I knew who the post was about without having to click into the link.

It got to the point where I once answered a question before he did, and had my answer accepted by the poster, and I felt like it should have come with a special achievement.  
 A single person answered 76k questions about SQL on StackOverflow. Averaging 22.8 answers per day, every day, for the past 8.6 years. (stackoverflow.com)  No wonder they're single.  
Why tie  yourself down when you are fighting off all the SQL groupies?  
One question. How?  
Answering questions on stackoverflow is probably as therapeutic as replying to comments on reddit for him.  
I answer questions as a bit of a warm-up exercise in the morning. My favorite questions are simply stated but that I don't immediately know how to solve (good opportunity to learn something new). I've learned a lot after a couple thousand questions.  
Dedication.  
Honestly, it sounds exhausting. I don't have the capacity in me to help people to that extent even if I wanted to.  
I ask the same question to Wikipedia editors. You see a disaster happening, you can be 100% sure somebody already created an article on Wikipedia. I just don't have that capacity.  
The only reason SQL works  
This guy has helped me so much üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è  
This is my main beef with crowd sourcing. Its is amazing that we collectively put together something to learn from but there are clearly individuals who have done more than others. I just checked mine and I am right at the threshold for 1k questions.  This person should get more for the effort they put in and it should come from stackoverflow the company. As they have directly created value for this company by doing this.  
he's got a book and a blog and probably other social media stuff that brings him money. probably a MVP too. he's promoting himself

Whenever this happens (like with heartbleed), I always wonder how long someone else has known and taken advantage of it.  
 Whenever this happens (like with heartbleed), I always wonder how long someone else has known and taken advantage of it.  Given the vast amount of mathematicians & security researchers employed by the NSA, it's hard to imagine they haven't known it for quite some time. The same probably applies to russian & chinese agencies...  
Absolutely this has been known by at least one global intelligence agency. However, using it carelessly poses the risk of an extremely valuable resource being burnt. It would likely be handled with the utmost‚Äôs of care and not in situations where the value of data it could glean would outweigh the risk of it being detected and burnt. In other words, it‚Äôs entirely unlikely that it was used to spy on your Yahoo Answers replies at the airport.  
Especially when they could probably just ask the people who run the airport wifi to let them spy on your Yahoo Answers replies.

This attitude frustrates me. Do they employ vastly more mathematicians and security researchers than the open research community? I doubt it.  While it is very likely that they know about many vulnerabilities that we don‚Äôt, it is much less likely that they have advance knowledge of any particular vulnerability. There are going to be ones they already knew about, but there are also going for be ones that they didn‚Äôt.  Now, maybe you can make a case for why this particular vulnerability probably would have been discovered by these agencies prior to now. But what you‚Äôre saying now amounts to spooky NSA with their spooky mathematicians knows everything. It‚Äôs not helpful.   
There's a reason people have this attitude...  There's a number of examples where the NSA and similar agencies have been years, if not decades, ahead of academic research.  The NSA had knowledge of an entire area of cryptanalysis for ~20 years before researchers discovered it.  They actually used it to make DES stronger against attacks.  So for 20 years people assumed the NSA did things to make it easier to crack until one day they noticed this new shiny cryptanalysis wasn't very good on the algorithm. So, yeah, I honestly wouldn't be surprised if they knew about this vulnerability.  You should expect them to be years ahead of outside research.  Mainly because they've proven themselves to be so a number of times in the past.  Since WPA is a widely used standard, they would've had eyes all over the protocol.  It's not conspiracy "spooky" mathematicians.  Just common sense.  They're good at what they do, and finding these flaws is exactly what they do. A real conspiracy would be to try and say the NSA didn't just know about it, they were the ones that introduced the flaw.  
Another factor is that government agencies have vastly more resources to commit than any single hacking group, with a continually rising budget. If they can't find the specific resource or zero-day exploit they need, they can also just buy them from the black-hat research community.  
Not only do they hire a huge number of mathematicians, they hire he best that they can find. There is also a large difference between NSA researchers and lab researchers: the NSA pays better. These NSA researchers exist solely to crack common systems and build exploit programs. From some of the program leaks, we know that they devise 0-day attacks long before anyone knows that there's a problem  
Somebody read Digital Fortress... No but actually the federal pay scales don't go high enough to pay truly top flight mathematicians. Any that actually are working for the NSA are doing so for other reasons.  
You've got it the wrong way round there. Lab researchers make way more than what the NSA pays, which is essentially just civil service wages. Large corporations have pockets dozens of times deeper than intelligence agencies.  
Tinfoil spoiler: There's even the idea that flaws were put intentionally. Or even more subtle, by suggesting a certain feature, hoping for an anticipated flaw.  
That's not just an idea. It's proven fact with some tech and app 'features' like with Skype once MS bought it.   
what exactly are you referring to with skype? I know once MS bought it it turned into a centralized system rather than decentralized, but that had a lot to do with the fact that at around the same time cell phone usage of skype went way up, and phones aren't exactly good decentralized nodes.  
and discord is the new skype  
I don't see anyone making any statements Discord is very secure. For business and more official things, Skype is still the new Skype.  
That's more than an idea, it was confirmed by the Snowden papers. Look up Dual_EC_DRBG  
I guarantee state actors have had the ability to bypass wpa2 for a lonnnnnnng time.  The return of cc jacking from big box businesses is about to return in a major way tho.  
 The return of cc jacking from big box businesses is about to return in a major way tho.  ... elaborate?  
Big credit card breaches from wardriving.. aka driving around with a laptop and wifi toolkits. Back when WEP first became vulnerable a lot of retailers were targeted and tons of credit cards were compromised.  All that cooled down quite a bit when everyone switched to wpa2.. With this coming out and PCI compliance still a joke I'll bet we see a return to the days of massive cc dumps.  
Well, we have largely migrated payment infrastructure to HTTPS nowadays, so I suspect this is less an issue.  
That would only work at retailers which haven't switched to EMV yet would be only useful for a few more years as the last of them switch over.   
Will be interesting to see the complexity required to perform this attack. A hole this wide in WPA2 would have serious security ramifications for almost all of us who connect to home and many commercial WiFi routers.   
The paper paints a pretty straight forward description of 'how' to implement all the various key re-installation attacks, including flow diagrams of the steps involved. The biggest 'hurdle' is intercepting wifi messages intended for clients s.t. you can respond, preventing them from doing so - this requires specialised equipment (or some good positioning / timing). To quote their conclusion section (emphasis mine):  These attacks do not violate the security properties of the formal proofs, but highlight limitations of the models employed by them. In particular, the models do not specify when a key should be installed for usage by the data-confidentiality protocol. Additionally, we showed that the PeerKey and fast BSS transition handshake are vulnerable to key reinstallation attacks. All Wi-Fi clients we tested were vulnerable to our attack against the group key handshake. This enables an adversary to replay broadcast and multicast frames. When the 4-way or fast BSS transition handshake is attacked, the precise impact depends on the data-confidentiality protocol being used. In all cases though, it is possible to decrypt frames and thus hijack TCP connections. This enables the injection of data into unencrypted HTTP connections. Moreover, against Android 6.0 our attack triggered the installation of an all-zero key, completely voiding any security guarantees. Rather worryingly, our key reinstallation attack even occurs spontaneously if certain handshake messages are lost due to background noise. This means that under certain conditions, implementations are reusing nonces without an adversary being present.   
I'd have emphasised the following passage, that suggests that by flooding the target's device so that it misses handshake messages, the attacker could "brute force" his way into having the attack trigger. IIRC, you can arbitrarily disconnect a client from an AP, making this even more feasible.  Rather worryingly, our key reinstallation attack even occurs spontaneously if certain handshake messages are lost due to background noise. This means that under certain conditions, implementations are reusing nonces without an adversary being present.   
Yup, you could simply target a client with deauthentication packets and knock them off of the network. It‚Äôs trivial to do.

Doesn't HSTS solve this?  
Personal gripe with HSTS: when using hotel/airport wifi, frequently what is required is that you access any webpage (e.g. google), it then redirects you to a login page, and then after you login you can then use the hotel wifi (android handles this better than windows - it automatically prompts you to the login page). With HSTS, I can no longer access any webpage - I have to find one without HSTS (moved from google to cnn, and then cnn to aljazeera). As HSTS becomes more commonplace, finding a login page will be harder. Someone with more tech chops than me recommended that I visit 1.1.1.1, which should always redirect to the portal as captive portal setup should redirect anything that's not in the client's dns resolver cache. So far that has solved my problem.  
http://neverssl.com/ was explicitly created for this purpose.  
You could also use http://example.com  
I always use http://html5zombo.com for this purpose. I can do anything.   
iOS uses captive.apple.com I use it for any device to test for captive portals now.   
Yes for the initial request problem, but even then only for those sites which take advantage of it.   
 The HTTPS mess of browsers (majority of users does not use HTTPS everywhere) causes an initial HTTP-request and waits for a redirect, instead of requesting HTTPS first and falling back.  The issue is that you often can't do this. If you try a https site and lock the user to it in some cases they'll just be stuck on some hosting provider's generic "domain taken" pake or something, or you'll end up locking the user on a completely unrelated website. Sure it's better today, especially since http2 is supposed to work only with SSL, but it's not like that's completely usable either.  
 After the WPA side-channel attacks I decided to go without Wi-Fi.  Do you honestly think the odds of someone with the necessary skills targeting your Wi-Fi signal are that high?  What would they even have to gain?  You can buy stolen identities online by the hundreds. 99% of the reason to secure home Wi-Fi is to keep your neighbors from freeloading.  No one is driving around cracking home Wi-Fi signals, there's just too little to gain.  
Except people were totally doing that during the WEP heydays. If the WPA exploit is easy and fast to execute, there will be a resurgence here  
[deleted]  
It's not about them targeting his wifi. It's about them having the potential to target anyone's wifi. From an individual perspective, he's better off staying ahead of the pack, security-wise. If the exploit gains widespread use, he'll be safe. It's generally easier to exploit older security, and there's generally a better return on targeting the status quo, rather than the bleeding edge. From a communal perspective, the people who do have things to hide are better off if they're not the only ones practicing good security. Otherwise good security only serves to draw attention to dissidents. Perhaps most importantly, people enjoy optimising. Some people optimise athleticism and others optimise material possessions. Others optimise their wifi connections. The journey is the destination.  
 It's not about them targeting his wifi. It's about them having the potential to target anyone's wifi.  His choice to "go without Wi-Fi" is 100% about the possibility it could be targeted.  Cracking someone's home wireless requires specific targeting and physical presence. I agree it's better to be "ahead of the pack" but he's chosen not to be in the pack at all.    
 A hole this wide in WPA2 would have serious security ramifications for almost all of us who connect to home and many commercial WiFi routers  I may be obtuse here, but what security ramifications are there? Modern Internet users generally are using protocols that have already assumed the lower-layer protocols are completely insecure. HTTPS, ssh, IMAPS, etc., none of them would be affected. There may still be some people there using HTTP, but that's becoming rarer, and no one's using it for anything serious. DNS is about all I can think of that's not secure any more, but again, the application layers are already assuming that DNS is insecure.  
[deleted]  
I think you might be overestimating people.  
Is there any alternative methods we can use now? Instead of WPA?  
Nope. Also the other responses to you are misunderstanding the impact of this.  Compromising WPA2 might be considered the equivalent of compromising your Ethernet cable.   It‚Äôs already game over in that case - maybe you‚Äôre safe if you stick to using a well-implemented VPN, but you still have a bad guy on your network, a bad guy capable of spoofing ARP, manipulating your DNS, and MITMing everything you do, not to mention whatever he‚Äôs using your connectivity for.  
Sorry for being stupid but... this only applies to wireless networks, right? Like, it's okay if you use an ethernet cable?  
Yes, but bear in mind that any wireless access to your network potentially compromised you even if you‚Äôre personally using a cable.  
And if it's that bad and can't be patched in software we are in for a world of hurt. The Wi-Fi Alliance would have to release a successor, which in itself could take quite some time and then every single WiFi appliance would have to be replaced. And the upgrade from WEP to WPA was easy in comparison to what we would have to do today. In 2004 the only things who would exclusively use WEP would be Laptops, some Desktops, a few PDAs and a single mobile gaming console, and at least Laptops and Desktops were easy to upgrade. Today everything but the kitchen sink has Wi-Fi built-in and it can't be upgraded in nearly all of those devices   
Think about all those millions of embedded/IoT devices that never get updated and have cheap and crappy wifi controllers. Hopefully there‚Äôll be a backwards compatible solution that requires no action by clients.  
Yes, that would be best, although millions of Wi-Fi routers would probably still run unpatched for all eternity (or until they become obsolete) Edit: From the official website:  No, luckily¬†implementations can be patched in a backwards-compatible manner.  But it sounds like routers and clients have to be patched, so we are going to have billions of unpatched devices on the market and especially IoT devices will probably never receive any patches  
Rely on secure protocols: https or as said in the article use a vpn provider (a secure one). Therefore the data sent is encrypted anyway and your wifi security doens't matter much. Bigger problem for home use is that your network could be abused for malicious purposes and you get blamed for them. It' snot like a hacker cares about your family photos.  
But there's no alternative to WPA? As far as routers go  
ethernet cables, unfortunately  
unfortunately I use android devices and chromecast more often then my laptop or desktop. I think 90% + of my home traffic goes through wifi so patching or upgrading my router will be necessary.  
Yeah, run a cat5 cable to your laptop like an insane person.  
let's be sensible here, you need at LEASt cat6 to be secure.  
Gotta have that shielding.  
Thanks. I'm not that insane.  
 Is there any alternative methods we can use now?  Cables.  
make sure you are using https there are also vpns, but know your vpn well, don't just grab anything there are "vpn"s out there that are which are scammy/ outright malicious/ fake/ misconfigured  
Bad advice. There are soooooo many other TCP and UDP protocols that don't have a HTTP equivalent. So saying "just use HTTPS" is like saying "Just always drive with a tank". But people also drive a roller, bike, surf board, bus, train, airplane and whatnot.  
this is the average user we're talking about the issue is banking, identity-heavy sites like facebook, etc. yeah you have to encrypt SMTP too but a lot of people are just doing email through the browser and who really cares if someone is messing with your gaming sessions (in terms of life-destroying intrusions)  
The "average" user still uses DNS, for example. And even if someone would use only HTTPS (without DNS, how'd you do that?), than the published information makes clear that you're still prone to DoS attacks.  
From the FAQs on https://www.krackattacks.com/  What if there are no security updates for my router? Our main attack is against the 4-way handshake, and does not exploit access points, but instead targets clients. So it might be that your router does not require security updates. We strongly advise you to contact your vendor for more details. In general though, you can try to mitigate attacks against routers and access points by disabling client functionality (which is for example used in repeater modes) and disabling 802.11r (fast roaming). For ordinary home users, your priority should be updating clients such as laptops and smartphones.  So it looks like patching only the clients (laptops/smartphones) could be enough?  
Yes, my impression is that the fix to the router is to prevent unpatched clients from being exploited. Presumably many of us have already installed the fix to our phones and laptops.   
Not just eavesdropping:  The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities includes decryption, packet replay, TCP connection hijacking, HTTP content injection, and others.   Basically WPA is just as 'bad' as WEP now.  These are the CVE-2017-identifiers registered for the exploits 13077, 13078, 13079, 13080, 13081, 13082, 13084, 13086, 13087, 13088. Yes. 10 of them. It looks like this is actually a pretty big deal. WPA-2 is vulnerable at the protocol level so it doesn't really matter if you use WPA Enterprise; it's just as vulnerable.  So yeah. "Oops" describes this mess pretty well.  If anything this shows the importance of end-to-end encryption and that now in 2017 there is no excuse at all anymore to not offer https to your customers.  Edit: Fortunately it can also be patched client-side so the world isn't coming to an end just yet (thanks /u/Chee5e) Edit 2: To all the people in this thread correcting others: please keep in mind that when this was posted the site explaining the exploit was not live yet and it seemed a LOT more severe.   
 Do we now need WPA3? No, luckily implementations can be patched in a backwards-compatible manner. This means a patched client can still communicate with an unpatched access point, and vice versa. In other words, a patched client or access points sends exactly the same handshake messages as before, and at exactly the same moments in time. However, the security updates will assure a key is only installed once, preventing our attacks. So again, update all your devices once security updates are available.  https://www.krackattacks.com/  
Thanks, added a reference to your comment to my TL reply.   
So what are the chances we will see patches for 5-year old devices? TP-Link? D-Link? Netgear? Linksys? Belkin? Asus? Android and iOS? I assume Windows 10 and OSX devices will get updated shortly.  
The patches you'll be looking for are client-side patches - patching the servers does nothing in this case.  The client needs to refuse to do something the spec says it should do and you'll be protected from this protocol vulnerability.  
Of course this still becomes a good reason to replace old equipment. Highly doubt that every AP out there will be receiving patched firmware, especially consumer-level stuff.  Maybe in DD-WRT or one of its variants, but even that's a fairly tall order.  
It's "broken" in a very different way to WEP - to be the same it would have to be a vulnerability in AES. The problem is actually a mistake in the mechanism for negotiating security parameters between the client and AP. It can be predictable - which means an eavesdropper could possibly intercept that negotiation and calculate the security parameters it needs to receive data from the client unencrypted at Layer 1/2.  People are reporting this as a "fundamental" flaw - but it isn't. It's a poorly implemented handshake process. Because of that, it is fixable through patching.  
Good to hear. Unfortunately it will take a LONG time until access points are patched though. So we should still consider access points to be insecure by default.   
Routers from ISPs will surely be updated. Surely...  
This is supposedly why Verizon backdoors their routers, so they better fucking be on top of it.   
Vodafone is actually quite fast to update their EasyBox, at least with the newer models.  
Apparently, the vuln is client-side so routers and APs should remain unaffected IIUC EDIT: should read ¬´ patchable client side, so routers and APs could remain unaffected ¬ª  
[deleted]  
 Basically WPA is just as 'bad' as WEP now.  Almost, but I'm still missing the part where the key could be recovered. Which would just be the plot twist to change that disaster into ubiqitous available Wifi everywhere in the world. I loved WEP for that. EDIT: There's no ubiquitous wifi:  Note that our attacks do not recover the password of the Wi-Fi network.   
How hard was it to crack WEP? Like how much time did it take?  
Couple seconds  
Ahh the good ol' days.  
It took about 4 years. Once the exploit was found it wasn't hard to fully open. In any security protocol, it takes a monumental amount of effort to close all the holes but it only takes one to destroy all that effort. The PS3 was a prime example of this, it lasted years until a key was found and then it was open season. WEP was the same and as it was embedded it was impossible to close the exploit. So this is a pretty serious problem and really can only be solved by end to end encryption on top of the standard network/wifi encryption.  
The ps3 is a bad example - the reason it stayed unhacked for so long was for social reasons.  Skilled console hackers are generally only interested in having access to the hardware for homebrew, not piracy, and Sony provided a sanctioned linux system which gave that to them. It's only when Sony decided to revoke OtherOS for everybody that those people were motivated to break the security out of spite, and they did it practically instantly.    
Minutes with kali's built in tools. So easy that there is a lifehacker article on it.   
Damn. If for some reason I find a WEP network somewhere, I might try that haha. Just to experiment of course Edit: I'd try that on my friend's or family member's network, with consent of course. Don't want to get in trouble for a bit of fun  
Wifi password can still easily be cracked via capturing the handshake and creating a fake access point with one of the pop-ups that you usually see at restaurants to social engineer their WiFi password. https://github.com/FluxionNetwork/fluxion  
HTTPS doesn't stop an eavesdropper from knowing which sites you visit - e.g. knowing which niche fetish sites a neighbour is on.

Is there any conceivable way to change the protocol and roll out a patch/update to every device? I could be entirely misunderstanding this, but it seems like WPA-2 is now fundamentally flawed with no clear solution.  
 but it seems like WPA-2 is now fundamentally flawed with no clear solution.  Yup. I did read some manufacturers are 'rolling out patches' but I frankly think that that is rather optimistic. There will be tons of devices that can't or won't be patched and at this moment we don't even know if it's even possible.  For now WPA2 should be regarded as insecure as WEP.   
laughs in cat-5  
That's scary. Really scary. - Sent from my laptop  
Probably from a WLAN that uses WPA2.  
I wonder how this may impact German wifi laws that holds the Internet subscriber 100% liable for all illegal activity that occurs through their internet subscription. Many people who have open or insecure wifi are still held liable for damages because of their negligence to secure their network.  
It's been changed recently, it's a bit less bad now  
Great point. It's an issue that might even require laws to be changed if it's as serious as they're suggesting. You can't require a non-technical person to have more knowledge than "you need to set a password on your wifi access point" IMHO. It's a huge mess.   
Precisely. WPA2 is now default insecure. We may eventually get to a point where a client (cellphone, laptop, etc) may be able to run a test exploit and warn the user "this AP is unpatched and you may be leaking info to an attacker", but that's not coming along for a long time, if ever, especially since it's of grey-legality (since it technically violates CFAA and similar). Not to mention that there are plenty of routers in sales channels that were manufactured before the exploit was announced or patched, and will thus be delivered to customers "new" who statistically speaking are unlikely to patch - "don't fix what isn't broken" and all that. The sad news is that there's no longer such a thing as secure WiFi, since even if you know you patched your equipment, your users can't really verify that.  
 "this AP is unpatched and you may be leaking info to an attacker"  The most likely way of exploiting this is to attack the client. And it is enough to just patch the client without patching the access point to be secure.  What if there are no security updates for my router? Our main attack is against the 4-way handshake, and does not exploit access points, but instead targets clients. So it might be that your router does not require security updates. We strongly advise you to contact your vendor for more details. In general though, you can try to mitigate attacks against routers and access points by disabling client functionality (which is for example used in repeater modes) and disabling 802.11r (fast roaming). For ordinary home users, your priority should be updating clients such as laptops and smartphones.

Unless your router was made in the past 3 - 5 years it probably doesn't autoupdate.  And it probably isn't supported anyway.  
Maybe OpenWrt or DD-WRT will be an option.  
 Basically WPA is just as 'bad' as WEP now.  ... unless one changes the APs to not accept several handshake 3-of-4 packets, or?  
 there is no excuse at all anymore  Except it turns out that it is quite difficult to set up. We've have been working on it for a year and still aren't there. The last piece is getting all the caching servers working nicely with it (and having to pay extra for the privilege of using https on the caching servers), but we are almost there. But, I wouldn't say there is no excuse since it is so difficult to rebuild a site that has been around forever to work with it.

 So we can get free wifi everywhere now? Great!  I hoped the same, but I couldn't read anywhere that recovering the key would be possible. Let's wait until there are more details about KRACK available.

The big question is: is wpa_supplicant and/or hostapd vulnerable?  
wpa_supplicant is vulnerable. Linux and Android 6+.  
https://w1.fi/security/2017-1/wpa-packet-number-reuse-with-replayed-messages.txt  
Yes, but there are already patches.  
Suddenly that $40 I spent on a VPN after a scary letter from my ISP about downloading something is looking better.  
If you were worried about scary letters from your ISP, then having a proven exploit in wireless security would actually help your case.  Also, a VPN doesn't help you too much for this exploit. You shouldn't be sending anything important unencrypted, anyways. VPN or not, if I can access your network, you've got trouble.  
But with VPN (or SSL) at least your stuff is encrypted in transit (until they manage a MITM attack that is). With this WPA 'krack' it isn't.   
Traffic snooping is the least of the problems introduced by this flaw. Local network access is where the gold is.  
Unprotected file shares FTW! /s   Many (most?) power-users out there run share folders via Windows so other machines on their local network can use them.  They have all figured that because their wi-fi traffic is encrypted, that the shares themselves needed no further protection.  It doesn't matter if those archives are your backups on a SAN, your porn stash, or just a collection of pictures from Christmas; they're all basically easily compromised once this gets industrialized at the script-kiddie level. Pretty much the ONLY thing keeping this from being a huge immediate disaster is the challenge of geographic access.  You have to be near a specific WAP to compromise the devices on it.  That said, it wouldn't take a genius to start sniffing around businesses at the very least to get their QuickBooks, POS data, etc. to make a payday with this.  
Ouch.  I'm using WPA2 with only AES. That's also vulnerable? Yes, that network configuration is also vulnerable. The attack works against both WPA1 and WPA2, against personal and enterprise networks, and against any cipher suite being used (WPA-TKIP, AES-CCMP, and GCMP). So everyone should update their devices to prevent the attack!

There's already a beta update that fixes this posted on the forums. Vendors we're warned about this vulnerability back in August.  
This is a client side issue. For Unifi gear the patches are only useful if they‚Äôre operating as a client, like as a bridge or point to point link. Your devices are still vulnerable.  
This is the best tl;dr I could make, original reduced by 85%. (I'm a bot)   An air of unease set into the security circles on Sunday as they prepared for the disclosure of high-severe vulnerabilities in the Wi-Fi Protected Access II protocol that make it possible for attackers to eavesdrop Wi-Fi traffic passing between computers and access points. US-CERT has become aware of several key management vulnerabilities in the 4-way handshake of the Wi-Fi Protected Access II security protocol. If initial reports are accurate that encryption bypass exploits are easy and reliable in the WPA2 protocol, it's likely attackers will be able to eavesdrop on nearby Wi-Fi traffic as it passes between computers and access points.

Please, have a look at the impact table in the paper before screaming it is the end of WiFi and we are all doomed to see our bank accounts emptied and whatnot. It is bad, it will have impact, but it is not the apocalypse.  
ELI5? This just means someone could hack into my wifi? Or does this affect general security when I browse assuming no one gets into my wifi?  
This has been so blown out of proportion.  The man in the middle attack has been viable on all untrusted networks always.  This was the point of https/ssl, to let us use untrusted public gateways. Now we just have to treat every network as untrusted, which further imparts the importance of https. With the rampant recommendations on using https for trust, secure information has been passed in this format for the better part of a decade, now we have evidence to kill unencrypted web resources. We should rejoice in our forethought in creating a more secure protocol.  It just further establishes the need for cryptographically sercure transmissions.  
People used to ask why I still use a hardwired network in my house ...  
Yikes, this could low-key be gigantic. If WPA is relegated to equal status as WEP, prepare for a world of hurt.  
"Low-key" is pretty much the opposite of "gigantic", so what does that sentence even mean? EDIT: Also, it's WPA2 we're talking about. WPA has been declared unsafe for more than 10 years.  
Security Updates available for Debian:  https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3999  
If my understanding is correct, this attack requires an attacker to be in relatively close PHYSICAL proximity.  This attach works by spooking handshake packets TO the wireless device.  This means crafted packets must be transmitted wirelessly, and must beat the AP response packets back (there may be ways around this latter part).  In short, unless I‚Äôm a high profile target or in a densely populated area, likelihood of attack is minimal.  More of an enterprise issue than an Average Joe issue.  I could be wrong (this is the Internet folks and I ain‚Äôt no expert).  
So is there anything that can be done to check my home wifi? Can I tell if there is unwanted traffic when I visit the router settings through my browser? Will allowing only specified MAC addresses prevent this from happening at home?  
Is this the time for WPA3? I'd like to see public wifi networks being encrypted now...  
Encrypting public networks is close to useless. You never know whether the person providing the access point is evil or not (they could easily be pretending to be any legit access point), so you kind of have to assume that they are. For example, if there was free $mycity Wi-Fi, I could set up an access point called "$mycity Free Wi-Fi" and grab all the data that comes through. Since I as the access point operator have to be able to decrypt the data (otherwise I couldn't forward it to the right place), I know the key, and all the data is mine if I want it. To secure this, you'd have to have a way for the access point to prove that it's legit, e.g. by publishing certificates in a place that's hard for an evil person to manipulate or fake. And then people have to actually check against the certificate, else all of this is a complete waste of time.  
 Encrypting public networks is close to useless.   No, it isn't. It was with WEP, where every client had the same en-/decryption key. But with WPA and WPA2 people use a session key. This is actually what the 4-way handshake is about: setting up a session key. That means also that client A has a different session key than client B. And so client A has a little bit of difficulty (would WPA/WPA2 be secure) to eavesdrop on client B.  
Yes, there are big improvements when you assume that the operator of the access point is trustworthy, but you really can't assume that unless you know the access point. It's extremely easy to run a fake access point on a notebook or whatever. I stand by my point.  
Asking without googling first. But why is wifi less secure than 3G. Both are wireless, I guess the sim card holds encryption keys, but couldn't your router exchange the same keys when you do the wps/whatever setup when you press the button? At least why isn't this another security protocol along wep and the rest?  
 3G  3G, e.g. GSM, was never secure. It has flaws known since 2009 and never was fixed.  I guess the sim card holds encryption keys  If you think this, then probably it's much better to send you off so that you buy yourself a book of "Applied Cryptography" from Bruce Schneier. This is a very readable book, you don't need to be a Ph.D. on maths for it. Sorry if this sounds like a snide remark, but I really have the feeling that you need first to get the basics. A reddit post / answer isn't really for way to teach this.  
Yes, thanks for the book recommendation. I do know the basics, how far was I off? I'd presumed the sim card has the public key of the operator and the operator has the public key of the card. But you're right, I'll do my research first before asking on reddit.   
The SIM card (and chip based credit cards) does keep the private key inside and it cannot be extracted, and it is also signed with the carrier's public keys, so this is a much more secure approach to storing and encrypting data than you may be used to. However, key storage is only one of the many factors and layers in the security of cellular networks. For one, this asymmetric encryption is generally only used in the initial key exchange, and generally a significantly faster symmetric key encryption is used, with varying levels of security. Thus, while one component may be solid the devil is in the details. There are also other backdoors by design on the carrier level, and security flaws out of communication practicalities, where if one layer is compromised it damages the security of the whole system.  
How long has this exploit been possible? Since we're only hearing about it now does that mean it hasn't really been used up until now?  
So... Any ideas for a secure successor to WPA2?  
Cell phone networking. (just kidding ... the protocols for cell phone networks are insecure in themselves. Already a decade ago the CCC exposed this, and not much changed).  
What a great way for the developer to learn that compiling for 64 bit doesn't increases the size of integers to 64 bits.  
I think the biggest issue is the implicit assumption that sizeof(long) > sizeof(int), which is not true in the LLP64 model used by the MS compiler. It's a bit sad that people seem so reluctant to use explicitly-sized types.  
I think the biggest issue here is to translate a date string into an integer "as-is". The MS ecosystem had future proof date values for a long time now.  
Storing sequences of ints as ints instead of strings is a pet peeve of mine. Always goes well when you then have a leading zero for some reason. Oh and this overflow issue.  
I‚Äôm not a coder, but I work with data occasionally. Why would you store something as an int when you can‚Äôt do math on it as is? I.e., adding 1 to the int 20211231 gives 20211232, but you actually wanted 20220101? It might naively seem like more work to make it a string, but there‚Äôs libraries to work with dates, no?  
 It's a bit sad that people seem so reluctant to use explicitly-sized types.   It's mind-boggling to me that this wasn't standardized in every language ever.  
It's a hold over from when people were writing C with the assumption that their library code might run on a wide range of cpus, like back in the day when windows did run on 16-bit cpus. They were relying on the compiler to size the types appropriately for the platform they were compiling for, so it would run no matter if the cpu was 8, 16, 32, or 64 bit. PoRtaBilItY It's a terrible idea, a terrible habit, and it doesn't apply in lots of situations like date math code. But the habit is hard to break, and there's a lot of legacy code out there. Im glad that newer languages (C# in particular) only has explicitly sized types. An int is always 32 bit.  
Or even on 36-bit CPUs, like the PDP-10... I'm actually kind of glad I don't have to deal with code that requires uint36_t.  
 Im glad that newer languages (C# in particular) only has explicitly sized types. An int is always 32 bit.  Rust goes even further and doesn't give you an easy way out... There isn't an "int" or "float" type; instead you have to consciously choose size and signedness between u32, i16, f32, etc, with the exception of pointer-sized usize and isize Edit: This not quite right; while explicit types are more often unsigned than signed, the default type of things like integer literals (ex: let x = 100) is i32. In fact, the rust book even writes the following:  So how do you know which type of integer to use? If you‚Äôre unsure, Rust‚Äôs defaults are generally good places to start: integer types default to i32   
COBOL lets you say how big you want the integers in terms of number of digits before and after, and Ada lets you say what the range is. In Ada, you can say "this variable holds numbers between 0 and 4095" and you'll actually get a 12-bit number. It isn't "new" languages only.  
Indeed.  And in fifty years it will be mind-boggling how we missed tricks now that will be so obvious then.  
!RemindMe 50 years  
In C, explicitly sized types (int64_t etc) aren‚Äôt actually guaranteed to exist. I mean, they WILL exist on any platform you or I ever actually target, and I think historically have existed on any platform that MSVC has supported, but if you‚Äôre a mediocre developer (or, especially, a mediocre dev promoted to management) you‚Äôre going to read ‚Äúnot guaranteed by the standard to exist on all platforms‚Äù and issue guidelines saying not to use them.  
That‚Äôs only true if you‚Äôre using really old C compilers. Explicitly sized types have been standardized for literally decades.  
Explicitly sized types are not actually required by the standard to exist.  Only int_fast32_t, int_least32_t, etc.  
 In C, explicitly sized types (int64_t etc) aren‚Äôt actually guaranteed to exist.   Aren't they standard as of C99?  
They are standard, but optional. There could in theory be a valid reason not to have such types - namely platforms which have weird word sizes. One such architecture is the PDP-11, which was an 18-bit architecture and also the original platform for which the C language was developed.  
Would you be willing to expound on that? A quick explanation of why?  
I think it breaks too many x86 software if the integer size was raised, so it was left at 32 bits. https://stackoverflow.com/a/7180344/1642933 EDIT: To clarify, this is an artificial limit and nothing stops you from writing a compiler that actually uses 64 bit integers as the default int type and have it work perfectly fine by itself. It's when you interact with the operating system that expects 32 bit integers as API values where everything goes wrong. EDIT2: Additionally you actually lose 16 or 32 bit integers unless you added some compiler specific integer type. Because between char and int is only short (or short int for the full name). char on x86 must be a single byte (C dictates that sizeof(char)==1) so if you define int as 64 bit (sizeof(int)==8), you only have the "short" type left for smaller integers. Do you pick 16 or 32 bits? This may actually be a much bigger reason to have int still as 32 bits.  
[deleted]  
 long long  It's astounding to me that at some point in time someone actually thought that would be a suitable name for a type.  
Because making integers bigger would unnecessarily take more memory for the same code. One of the goals of higher architectures is larger address space (more houses per road) not necessarily just larger data bus size (bigger houses possible on the road). If it takes 1 GB of memory to run an application and 50% of that application is integers, you just increased the memory footprint by 0.5 GB, even if you don't need bigger integer sizes.  
We did see exactly this sort of effect with pointer-heavy applications. It's not just about the memory use, either -- if the CPU cache doesn't increase, then the program might run slower, because more memory use means less of it fits in cache. There are some clever tricks for getting around this, especially for managed languages -- for example, JavaScript apps tend to use (implicit) pointers absolutely everywhere, but modern browser engines will use 32-bit offsets instead of pointers to avoid storing the full 64 bits in most places.  
On windows, even longs stay 32bit but Linux longs are 64bit, just to give you some nice cross platform compatibility issues  
When I was doing multi-platform lib development in c++, I mostly used the explicit types, e.g. uint64_t.  The real oddity here is someone is reading input into an integer when it's clearly not. You could easily imagine a new format that allows seconds, ms, etc that would exceed the length of a 64bit int as well. Pretty sloppy honestly.  
This only affects C and C++. And they supply a standard header with sized integer types to avoid pitfalls like that.  
Dear Twitter @MSexChangeTeam, there are times when capitalization makes a difference Edit: formatting

Microsoft has a sex change team?  
It's always a great Idea to convert strings to numbers without any fallback... This bug is pure gold!  
Who the fuck stores dates like that?  
microsoft, apparently  
I wonder if this is why my work scanner (that uses Microsoft software) was giving me shit today. Every time I accept an order it tells me that I'm accepting an order for a year outside of our current year, despite the date on the scanner showing 2022 and the date of the invoice being 2022. Edit: I have just overheard my bosses discussing that  Microsoft office has shut down entirely, and they "dont know why, but it went down some time before this morning." HMMMMMMMMM.  
 HMMMMMMMM    now if they had used that date format they wouldn't have this problem!  
It's not HMMMMMMMMM, it's  YYMMDDhhmm.  
Hmmmmm? Don‚Äôt you mean HHMM? Edit: jokes already been made.  
For being a company that does nothing but software, Microsoft is a terrible software company. Their Xbox app is one of the worst apps I‚Äôve ever had to deal with.  
It's actually kind of entertaining. Windows is basically built on a few decades of garbage implementations and workarounds, their C++ headers are terrifyingly bad. Any app they create that is included with windows, especially the Xbox app as you mentioned is just a travesty. The photos app doesn't even work properly in Win11... the fucking PHOTOS app. Yet they have .NET, C#, VSCode, Visual Studio, and a whole bunch of other incredible software tools that are very well designed. Like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
Some of it is the price of decades of legacy/backward compatibility support IMO, but not all of it.  
Almost like they have different teams working on different things, thus different levels of quality on each product  
 Their Xbox app is one of the worst apps I‚Äôve ever had to deal with.  There doesn't seem to be a steady relationship between what you click on or want to happen and what happens.  
It's the software equivalent of using an unfamiliar remote in the dark to control things without a screen. And even then, those things won't turn on for 2-3 minutes if you get it right.  
In the 90s and 00s the phrase "Microsoft are a marketing company that sell technology" was a pretty apt description. They marginally improved when Balmer got fired left, and pivoted to trying to appeal to technologists but it seems old habits die hard and the mask is slipping again.  
To be fair, some of the tools they create by developers for developers are not bad.  VS Code is perhaps held back by electron, but it is pretty well designed apart from that.  
They actually produce keyboards and mice... Which are superior compared to their software... üòâ  
you haven't lived until you've seen phone numbers stored as number fields  
How about storing them as floats???  
That's what the parent comment said, integers.  Sincerely, JavaScript.  
Oh man, I wonder how many JS pages died when people started entering international phone codes on the reg.  
Ah yes, called the wrong number because of a floating point error.  
I worked with middleware that insisted that ip addresses were supplied as four strings of three ANSI characters, including the leading zeroes in one context and then as four integers in another (took me a while to track down that bug and put a wrapper in place to account for it). Phone numbers as numbers wouldn't surprise me at all.  
Ironically a case where 32-bit ints actually would have been pretty appropriate.  
Or zip codes. Which are allowed to start with zero.  
And also are non-numeric in many other countries. EDIT: another fun fact, 'zip codes' are not actually geographic areas.  
I've done it myself. As a junior programmer and was proud of how clever I was. Nobody put there international numbers so I've been OK. But please don't.  
I know right? Need to store time as not a string? time_t. Need to store dates as a string? There's a standard format for that. Microsoft: "Let's do neither!" Funny story from a long time ago when I was just a call center monkey. This guy writes in that he's trying to use OS/2 to control a satellite. The docs say he can set time in milliseconds with some function call or other, but it doesn't seem to be working. So I dig out the assembly language timing driver which was available with one of the dev kits IBM sold at the time. OS/2 was a joint IBM/Microsoft collaboration in the OS/2 1.0 days. So anyway, what the driver is doing is every 22 ms or so an interrupt it's listening for fires and it increments an internal counter by 22. Now here's the fun part, if the OS is busy, that 22 ms interrupt  can get missed. Their clever solution for that is that there was a periodic 1 second interrupt, and if they saw the 1 second interrupt they would just zero out the ms counter and increment seconds by 1. The API call the guy was using adjusted the ms counter, so every second his adjustment would be clobbered. I submitted this as an APAR and almost immediately got back a "Working as designed." Wrote the thing up for the customer and pointed him at the dev material if he wanted to build his own timing driver. I don't know what he did after that.  
At my work you can find all of this in the same code 202108 082021 31082021 20210831 Ago2021 31,08,2021  I always have to add a comment at the beginning of the code detailing all the date formats the code use and how many times expect any of them to appear so I know what to expect next month I need to update the dates before running.  
I've interoperated with mainframe programs that used this. I probably chunked with substr instead of toint and then dividing, ut who knows. It was in java so integers are signed 32 bits.

Great, that‚Äôs all I can see now‚Ä¶  
But muh sTAtE oF tHe ArT aI!!  
Old COBOL guy here, veteran of the the Y2K programming push that turned the bug into a non-event. Damn near every language has a Datetime object. Fucking use it. Rolling your own using yyyymmddhhmmss or whatever is eventually going to cause some kind of problem.  
Theres a reason datetime libraries come packaged with almost every language, its to avoid reinventing the already well defined wheel. Its pretty embarrasing to go through this issue now a days  
Every line in datetime libraries are written in blood. Use them.  
A lot of languages' time libraries suck, to be fair. Not as bad as this bizarre hand-rolled format, but still pretty bad. For example, in Java the situation has much improved in recent years, but for many years if you used either of the two(!) time libraries included with the JDK you were just begging for trouble. Now the third (yes, really) bundled time library is finally good. As I understand it Python's built-in tools are pretty dreadful to this day, and it is not the only language in this position. So, yes, use someone's date/time library, because date/time is impossible and someone has thought about it more than you have. But not necessarily the one bundled with the language.  
Current Java's date-time library is probably the best one among all programming languages. Strongly typed, distinguishes all important date/time concepts, has all necessary features, extensible, uses correct grammar when formatting. In other languages, you need a third-party library. (In case of some languages, having date/time support beyond basic timestamps is not in the scope, so this is understandable, but in "batteries included" languages it's at least very disappointing.)  
 COBOL guy here, veteran of the the Y2K programming push  I literally had to fix a Y2K fix two days ago. We still get two-digit years from the mainframe, and we have to convert them to four-digit years in our (Java) code. In one particular program this was done like:   if (yy.compareTo("20") > 0) {     year = "19" + yy; } else {     year = "20" + yy; }  This particular program was working with dates mostly from the previous year. So now that we're getting into 2022, it was starting to get 2021 years. And since "21".compareTo("20") > 0 is true, the two-digit year "21" became the four digit year "1921"...  
Imagine the programmer back in 1999 optimistically thinking - no way we'll be using this ancient mainframe 20 years from now! We'll all be using quantum computers in our flying cars!  
And this must have been invented after Y2K: older dates won't fit either. To print something sane with %d (which I presume is the motivation), it also needs a date after 2010, when 64-bit systems are becoming mainstream. Lesson learned: we need to stop using designs that are outdated at the time of design. I swear I'll stop using Python 2.7 for my next script.  
Why did it need to be after 2010? Why would 2005 print any different  
Because it‚Äôs a two-digit year. It would have to be single-digit or zero-prefixed. Both of which looks silly.  
At least in Python you can do "{num:06d}" to format a number that is padded with zeros only if necessary. >>> x = 220101 >>> f"20{x:06d}" '20220101' >>> x = 50101 >>> f"20{x:06d}" '20050101'  Edit: not sure about other languages that actually use proper number representation, lol.  
%06d will do it for printf style functions.  
if it's an integer type then there's no difference between single-digit and zero-prefixed  
 I swear I'll stop using Python 2.7 for my next script.  Why would you use Python 2.7 for a new script? It makes nothing easier. Use at least 3.6  
No, use 3.9. There's already some packages that don't have 3.7 wheels anymore (and some that don't have 3.10 wheels yet), and there's no reason to use something old. Except maybe the culture shock of all the good things. Pathlib, typing, the hundreds of small things.  
PyTorch doesn‚Äôt support Python 3.9.  
So let me get this straight, python packages are not compatible with different MINOR version numbers of the language? wtf  
Python does not follow semantic versioning, at least in the way you are expecting. Every point release (3.7, 3.8, ...) is comparable to a major release.  
They're not minor versions. 3.10 added structural pattern matching with the match statement. 3.9 added a new parser, and a lot of stdlib improvements  
 To print something sane with %d (which I presume is the motivation), it also needs a date after 2010, when 64-bit systems are becoming mainstream.  Or someone able to read printf documentation to add a leading ‚Äò0‚Äô to the number using, I guess, %010d. That said, stuffing the formatted date in the integer doesn‚Äôt indicate a lot of understanding‚Ä¶  
Python 3 is much better anyway. Fight me.  
Wasn't this what everyone was worried about for Y2K? Here we are 22 years later fighting off a plague, and "oh yeah the date rollover buggered our computers lol" A bit of dark comedy for you  
Dates are a very common pitfall in programming. They seem simple but as soon as you actually start to work with them, you realize how complex they are. There's the normal stuff like getting the number of days per month right, then leap years, fitting weeks and days and months all together correctly, and then you get into the really tough things like time zones and daylight saving (oh, you assumed each day was 24 hours? twice a year it isn't!) and leap seconds and moving across borders (if you liked daylight saving, good news, you can do it as much as you want in some places!) and bad hardware clocks (hope your software still functions when suddenly it's 1970, or when time stops entirely).  Then add in a penchant for "doing it more efficiently" or "only using what we need" and you get things like this, where whether you know it or not, you've put an expiration date on your software and hopefully it can be noticed and fixed before problems happen.  
Yup, see falsehoods programmers believe about time  
[deleted]  
Might have to do with historic dates, shit gets crazy the farther you go back.  Daylight savings moves, whole years disappear, it's madness  
Yup. Tom Scott did an episode on this.  
I wonder what the impact of the 2025 problem, a.k.a. Showa 100 problem, will be. Some Japanese computers systems written in the 80s use Japanese calendar for dates, which works in eras tied to reigns of the emperors, but were not designed for switching to a new era, so they keep counting as if the guy whose army bombed Pearl Harbor were still alive. Showa era ended in 1989, but if it never did, 2025 would be Showa 100. And if you have only two digits for the year... You know where it's going.  
I'm reminded of a perl date builtin that returns the year minus 1900.  You're supposed to add 1900 for it for display, but a lot of people just did a string concat of "19" and the year.  It's currently year 19121 to those poor programs.  
So Y22K bug ?  
Y2K bug, Service Pack 22  
Y2.022K bug, really. Which just means typing an additional "." and "K"  
Call it Y2Ki - only off by a tiny factor, and near enough is good enough  
that's 2048, which is even less accurate than Y2K  
22000, sure  
Pretty much the pinnacle of the Dark Age of Technology. Good place to be.  
The Y2K38 issue looks like it's actually going to cause serious issues.  
I'm hoping to make 2037 my retirement year.  
We already ran into a Y2K38 issue in 2013 with some code looking 25 years ahead. And this was in the video game industry. I‚Äôll just recommend not flying or driving on January 18-19, 2038.  
In fact just a simple Y22 bug. Fails for 1922 as well.  
How did anything pre-2000 work then?  
It didn't, software was invented on January 3rd, 2001. Anyone who says otherwise is lying to you.  
You need to make a lot of dumb decisions before storing a date this way. I would expect this wouldn't occur often. The parser code for it would look... Interesting. Lots of zeroes and modulo.  
 The parser code for it would look... Interesting. Lots of zeroes and modulo.  I would figuratively eat my shorts if the parser code was anything other than calling toString or whatever and cutting up the result.  
Stuff like that is infuriating. Climate and weather data in myriad online repos everywhere, especially from government met agencies-- I'll generously say about a 6th of my time something in my scripts might fall over because of weird date-parsing. Either it's just a number, or it includes some sort of meta information like time zone or units (e.g. "seconds since HMS"), maybe it's a satellite that uses a special format for "leap seconds." Don't forget the classic: is 20200809, September 8th, or August 9th? Edit: forgot to whine about strange delimiters. If you store 20200809 so it somehow dumps out as 20,200,809.... A comma delimited text file is pretty... Special.  
As someone who has spent a decade writing drivers and parsers for met and air data, I think I've seen just about everything. No two devices used the same date format. Some devices used different formats for getting the clock, setting the clock, sending a data request, and timestamping the data. Infuriating. When my turn came to write one, it was 100% ISO8601 on the wire. Internally I used .Net's "ticks" in a long int for database timestamps.  
 ISO8601  The one, true, date format -- our lord and savior.  
I remember when researchers reported fraud in Bolivian elections based on timestamps in AM/PM format sorted lexicographically: https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ig27qo/sorting_error_caused_oas_to_report_bolivian/

No, that's called a DateTime. Don't store dates in strings when your programming language and your database have perfectly fine data types for them.. If you need a string later on you just format the data.  
This is why we need to abandon petty concepts like primitive and advanced data types and return to the purity of working with everything as an arbitrarily formatted binary blob. That way we'll never know when something is broken for stupid reasons, because everything will be broken for very good reasons!  
Yes, I am aware classes for dates and times exist. This doesn't mean that YYMMDDhhmm isn't a string. The argument for turning YYMMDDhhmm into unix time and storing it properly is an entirely separate one.  
Could someone explain this bug in simpler terms? I work as a developer but I don't understand what this means  
They were storing times formatted like this: 2 digits for the year, 2 digits for the month, 2 digits for the day, 2 digits for the hour, 2 digits for the minute. So 2021-09-13 14:37 becomes 2109131437. ... except then, instead of storing it as a string like a sane person, they tried to store it as an integer. 4-byte signed integers can go from -231 to +231 - 1, so -2147483648 to 2147483647. With New Years 2022 the time ticked over from 2112312359 (2021-12-31 23:59) to 2201010000 (2022-01-01 00:00), which all of a sudden is outside the bounds of a 4-byte integer, thus throwing some form of type error on the conversion to integer.  
This is very funny. I was having a bad day but now I had a good laugh and feel better. Thanks, Microsoft!  
thanks for explaining. I read all the comments and still didn't understand, because my brain just wouldn't compute that anyone would choose to store a date like that. why?  
Maybe to save space? A date stored as an integer would take 4 bytes vs 10 bytes as a string (or 12 bytes if you want to store the 4-digit year and prepare for the years up to 9999). Even then, if we‚Äôre still around in the year 10000, I bet you the Y10K problem will be much worse and widespread!  
Microsoft apparently stores the current date in a format like YYMMDDhhmm So yesterday (2021-12-31T23:59:00) would be stored as: 2112312359 or with thousand separators: 2,112,312,359  This is lower than the maximum unsigned integer value: 2147483647 or with thousand separators: 2,147,483,647  Today the year incremented, so Microsoft exchange tries to parse this date as an integer (2022-01-01T00:00:00) 2201010000 or with thousand separators: 2,201, 010,000  This number it higher than what an unsigned int can store, so the date parsing fails, which crashes the Exhange server... EDIT: Mixed up signed and unsigned... Thanks for pointing it out /u/alphaatom  
How does that handle dates before 2000  
It probably doesn't...  
So the whole system is capable of handling only around 20 years?  
Small correction, it‚Äôs lower than the maximum signed integer. Unsigned 32 bit integer has a maximum value of 4,294,967,295.  
We use a similar format at work to index all of our sales data for clients (we don't is hhmm yet at least). There are some benefits when you need to aggregate for reporting, and we use int too... Maybe for reducing index sizes? Don't quote me on that. The point being that this is probably not being converted back and forth to a proper date like many comments are suggesting  
... SIGNED!?!?!?! Why would you use signed for something that can never be negative?  
I mean that just gives them extra 20 years (2043)  
Technically with 0 being 2000-01-01 00:00 negatives are useful to represent dates like 1990-01-01 00:00 as -1001010000  
laughs in B.C.

How can it be that msoft's QA department isn't running test servers with clocks set a month, a year, and maybe even 20 years (hi, 2038!) in the future? How can that be? If they were, they would have known this was going to happen and remediated it. What are the rich corporations who buy and use their own Exchange rigs paying for, anyway?  
Yeah, these kind of time based errors have happened more than once. It's one of the reasons Linux has added a time namespace, it makes easier testing these corner cases.  
 How can it be that msoft's QA department isn't  It would be unfair to ask their end-users to set their clocks decades into the future.  
It's interesting how the hack occured https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/06/intel_nda_source_code_leak/ It was an attack to an Akamai server at the beginning of the year, I suspect this was a file server right when people were figuring out how to do remote work.  
[deleted]  
Oh yeah, this exploit in particular is from this and I think he hasn't leaked more stuff from this exploit. Most of other things are misconfigured network on SonarQube instances that exposed them to Internet. This is sad because I imagine development teams were proud of having continuous integration but did not used something like a Nexus (Sonatype) to proxy/store the packages in the intranet, and instead relied on getting things from Maven and such directly. But most dumps don't document how they were gotten. I guess people exploit a flaw for some months before leaking what was downloaded so the person doesn't figure out and fix the flaw quickly. Edit: a statement from sonar devs https://blog.sonarsource.com/public-response-code-leaks  
Ya I mean journalists do this to. Release tiny bits so to get politicians/companies to respond with limited hang outs then just keep making them look deceitful by releasing more they held back.  
As well as bored, unemployed people with the technical knowledge to carry them out.  
I just got hired at a young but promising tech company. I had to sign an NDA just to interview with them, mandatory badge if I'm ever onsite, etc. Every onboarding powerpoint, schedule, memo, and article I see is marked confidential in the corner. And my team collaborates all day long on Zoom, sharing information that would let the competition size us up pretty easily.  
Because everything they made you do was about compliance box checking for audit controls, not actual security. Some elements (such as the badge) help against basic social engineering and physical access, but they're just a minimal layer of what should be a more comprehensive plan.  
Nothing actually says what you have to do for compliance, only that you do something and can prove you did.  
There are certain things you have to do for compliance, clearly spelled out, such as level of password security. Then there are other bits which are commonly interpreted by auditors as having a specific meaning - if you don't follow their meaning then you won't pass the audit, plain and simple.  
There‚Äôs lots of industry-specific regulation that‚Äôs quite detailed. E.g. in finance/banking.  
Intel said this: https://www.tomshardware.com/news/massive-20gb-intel-data-breach-floods-the-internet-mentions-backdoors "We are investigating this situation. The information appears to come from the Intel Resource and Design Center, which hosts information for use by our customers, partners and other external parties who have registered for access. We believe an individual with access downloaded and shared this data." Hardly a hack.... Just a violation of an NDA. Not really shocking or amazing or sneaky or all these things everyone makes it out to be. The notorious hacker 4chan isn't at it again.  
I guess you haven't seen the other dumps or downloaded the files. While this is a possibility the dude of leaks has source and info on a ton of chips and things that have been verified in the past. Remember, he isn't the one who hacks, he leaks and publishes hacks people send his way. Judging from his history it started when people send him docs on the inner workings of Widevine. The Intel content is a ton of files, so it's hard to parse everything now. At the beginning of the year most source hacks he received were misconfigured SonarQube instances in CI systems. The dude with the leaks says his source has more things, I would wait a bit to see what this turns out to be. Edit: also there's a possibility that it is a hack to a third party so not an intentional NDA breach.  
Not sure if you have ever worked under an NDA, but it's not super secret society kind of stuff. You just get access to stuff easily, under the promise that if you leak it you will be held legally accountable. It's way more likely an intern or dumbass is the cause. Calling any of this "hacks" is like calling a guy who walks in your open door and takes your milk a secret agent spy.  
There's no way for us to know, Intel will claim it was an internal leak to save face and the hacker could claim he is external to avoid suspicion. The explanation for the hack seemed reasonable at least.  
Idk what do you think they are going to say, ‚Äúyup, we got hacked and it was real important stuff‚Äù?  
Wow, finally some documentation..  
Probably the emulator guys did it better anyway  
‚ÄúIntel ME bringup guide‚Äù <3  
 If you find password protected zips in the release the password is probably either "Intel123" or "intel123". This was not set by me or my source, this is how it was aquired from Intel.  lol  
It is probably for sharing zip files over email. If you set a password on a zip that contains an executable then outlook won't block it.  
Yeah we did that too.  Password wasn't for security, it was so it didn't get eaten  
I dunno, you can literally just change the file extension to .txt or something and outlook won't block an executable, but maybe this was their solution  
That depends on what‚Äôs doing the blocking. Outlook itself doesn‚Äôt really block anything, that‚Äôs done on either the Exchange server or another hardware/software set.  
Other more competent (but still totally inconvenient and user hostile) email providers still block the file. I'm looking at you, GMail. I cannot attach a self-extracting exe to my email, even if all my personal devices are Linux or Android based, and the destination is myself. That's ridiculous, really.  
They block sending to yourself because that prevents password stuffing attack or session hijack from escalating to local access  
Its easier to explain to middle management people a password than how/why to change the extension. Those probably didn't even switch on seeing them in Windows. (what a shitty idea to hide extensions)  
In fairness outlook blocks non-password zips with executables in them  
This is the correct answer for why that password is used on .zip files  
It's funny, but you don't use zip passwords to protect data; you use other things like permissions on file shares. These likely have passwords on them to let them through Outlook, since Outlook usually blocks zip files that have no password.  
This is the third company I know that uses company name + "123" as a password.  
The secret to good security is to add some punctuation on the end, like "123?" or even "123!"  
123‚ÄΩ  
Secure and sarcastic. I like it.  
One of my customers, a large chain of stores uses the domain admin password of Test123!  
Nice, a mix of upper and lower case, alpha characters and numeric characters, and even punctuation characters. Hack that, hackers!  
Oh for fuck sake.... Good thing I'm not in college for Security. I'd probably want to kill anyone using easy guess passwords like that.  
It's common to intentionally use weak passwords on resources you don't care about. Like dev environments and such.  
Exactly. Imagine having a VM or something you distribute as a dev env and not a company wide dummy password for root on them. Sometimes stuff has to have a password for the sake of having it.  
Systems without authentication by default make a lot of sense: prometheus or mongodb for example.  Keeping default passwords or simple known ones is useful to automate a lot of stuff in dev environment. Unfortunately, this practice often find its way to production.  
True, but at that point why even encrypt.  
Maybe there's a password that you set to Intel123 in dev environment, and set to something else in production.  
To keep the AV away from it sometimes, especially email that will sometimes just block any exe or script it detects  
Idk, to make sure your encryption works? If you develop an app with an account system, you‚Äôll probably have some accounts associated with fake emails and with short passwords just to make repeated logins less tedious.  
Because the exchange servers bounce your emails that have un-encrypted zip or exe files attached.  So they zip them up with a simple password.  Problem solved!  
Having a password does not mean anything is encrypted, it just means something is password protected. One example might be that you're developing a web service that has an authentication component, and in a dev environment you just use a weak password out of the box, which might be a lot more straightforward than putting in all kinds of branches in your code to turn authentication on or off. For a password protected file, maybe there's a standard password in dev or test mode, and then in the prod environment it's got a real password that is managed with some production-level infrastructure.  
Wait till you figure out how management feels towards security. You'll start drinking before you even get out of college...  
Always managements fault. Oh I know this well. 99% of the time, its correct.  
Also "I accept" LMAO!

Instructions unclear, violated my neighbor and infected quarantine law.  
This is going to be interesting. I'm curious about what they meant by "backdoor". Could it be a technical term? Or does it really mean a backdoor for intruders?  
Christopher Domas talks about stuff like this.  Pretty sure he has more videos covering the topic of looking for undocumented instructions on x86 chips.  
Christopher domas is an absolute god in this subject. his hadwork should've earned him a matrix character name at this point  
Absolutely. I saw his talk at Defcon 2 years ago, and talking to him after it was the closest I've ever come to being starstruck.  
AFAIK Intel hired him  
They did! I used to work with him. He's as amazing as you think.

Yeah, but https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ppKzNTP2vQ

Domas makes me insecure about my knowledge of computers. He's so damn bright. His mov-only C compiler is a modern wonder.

Did he ever release information on that hardware bug that he was being secretive about at the end?

I have been a software engineer in corporate environments for 25 years and I have never heard the term "backdoor" used to mean anything other than a way to access a resource with a weaker security check (or to circumvent a security check).  It might not be intended for "intruders," it might be for employees to debug issues, or admins of a company to get access to other data, etc. But there isn't a standard technical meaning beyond the common one.  
I am 5 years /u/FunkyPete 's junior, but I concur.  It only has one meaning, an intentional security vulnerability that it's used out of convenience (or perhaps malice) to gain access to something ostensibly well secured.  
Intel VP here, you conspiracy guys are always taking things the wrong way. Back door, is the opposite of front door. In case of fire you can exit through either the front or back door. Now move along, nothing to see here. I said MOVE ALONG!!!  
Where do I sign up for the six figure NSA bonus check?  
It really depends how high up the stack you are. I write software models of CPUs and GPUs, working closely with hardware teams and firmware developers.  At this level, the term 'backdoor' can and does have a variety of meanings; we could elide a DMA memory transfer by using a 'backdoor' debug function to write in a way that, architecturally speaking, isn't possible - but makes sense in the software environment the model has created. We can 'backdoor' dynamic stimulus to the core for fault injection during testing, we can 'backdoor' a poke of a general purpose register rather than write ASM and boot the processor at a mov instruction.  Granted, these examples are for pre-silicon verification. It must also be stated that 'backdoors' can be used for patching Errata via other mechanisms on silicon, a general purpose housekeeping CPU on board could patch data in an internal cache if under certain, driver driven circumstances, it can be known it is invalid - the list goes on.  This thread reeks of misinformation. There very well may be security backdoors in Intel SW/HW. It is a fool who believes it would be exposed in shared, vendor level board/chip support packages.  
Without giving away too much I work on Intel platform bios. The backdoor example in the link isn't a security. It's someone using a backdoor internally to access functionality.  
The only "backdoor" in the code that was leaked for was for reliability enigne and seems like it is used for determining memory errors within any memory address. This function is protected behind other authentication methods and functionally doesn't return any data other than that it detected a memory error. It cannot be used to read memory from an unauthenticated state, nor can it give you authentication like what traditionally a backdoor means. IMO, its more bad naming convention than a backdoor.  
From The Register's article:  A spokesperson for Intel said the information was likely taken from its Resource and Design Center, which is a private library of resources for computer manufacturers and the like to build systems using Intel's silicon. Access to this center is not open to the public as its content is intended to be used, for instance, to craft firmware and design motherboards compatible with [Intel]'s microprocessors.  If the leak is from resources they give to a bunch of manufacturers I seriously doubt it's referring to an actual backdoor. I'm pretty sure Intel would not be sharing information of backdoors in a US product with manufacturers in Taiwan and Hong Kong. (Note that the leaker also says this is where the data came from)  
stop saying backdoor.  The proper term is "management engine" IMHO anyone who doubts there's an entire complex autonomous system inside of every single chipset for the past decade+ with ring -3 access that hasn't been fucked sideways by AT LEAST the NSA and CCP is a certifiable idiot.  
Carry on the fight. I'm old and tired and nobody ever listens anyway. Anybody who can rub two bytes together should have the intelligence to figure that any hardware device that's completely un-auditable would have more holes than swiss cheese. I'm sure there are holes for our government, Intel and probably other governments. Nothing that passes through a network or computer can be considered safe.  
This is exactly why I'm hoping RISC-V starts getting more traction. We really need to have open source hardware that we can actually trust.  
RISCV is only a common ISA baseline. An implementation of RISCV can have many extra instructions for auditing, backdoor, etc.  
A man can dream about a computer that has no magic hidden cpu doing god knows what.  
You must be referring to Minix... I'm going to need to search for references to that too.  
I don't get how there apparently isn't a single dev there who didn't leak it completely. How the hell does one work on cancer like this, knowing it's going into everyone's computers & not realize how evil it is? Not only that, also dangerous. There were vulnerabilities. What if someone spreads malware to a significant majority of machines and then bricks them? Because it's definitively possible. Sure, re-flashing the BIOS might fix it. Who will do that with a billion machines? NSA might one day "protect" the "free world" so much some rogue state will fucking literally turn it off. And then there's random comments here saying they work on BIOSes / whatever. Malignant forcibly-properiary dangerous shit. Also crappy. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15p4E9WD7j0 Apparently modern machines don't necessarily need to take half a minute to reach the goddamn bootloader. But they do.  That's not even mentioning the pissing on consumers by making the physical, purchased product protects itself FROM THEM. I'm talking about DRM here. Through also ME, I guess, since you can't disable it, for your own good apparently, despite not using any of the "features" - and if you try the chip might SHAMELESSLY BRICK ITSELF by turning off 30m after booting it. Leaking Intel's "confidential" documents should be considered self-defense.

Someone‚Äôs been rooting for them Intel now....  
OK, while I too have been rooting for AMD, and Intels shady ass business practices for the last couple decades certainly seem to be coming home to roost with a fucking vengence now, in the interest of fairness I need to point out AMD also has shady backdoors (aka "Management Engines").  
Children think of the world in black and white.  
I know there is absolutely two sides to this. But allowing that leak, plus firing an exec, delaying 7nm to 2023, years delay in 10nm, and a class action lawsuit for hiding incompetence. Intel has had a very bad year.  
Plus AMD has been curb stomping intel with their chips on performance/price and flat out performance  
Another case of unexpected technical support.  
Hopefully they'll leak the Intel DX79SI bios source so I can fix the shoddy support Intel gave their X79 range of motherboards.  
Not a good year for Intel.  
Well considering rest of year, they really should have expected it to happen.  
They're going to have a field day over at /r/ayyMD  
I've been long on AMD for a while but healthy competition is always best. Hope Intel can get their shit together somewhat  
To anyone who thinks this is new, it is not. About 7 years ago I started working on software sold to Synovous ans Chase Bank. I was a typical full stack developer. The guy next to me wrote backdoors into the software, he worked under an NDA, as did I at the time. The backdoors were not for employees but for regulators to use at will because some new legislation at the time had made it a requirement for us to provide the government with their own access which was beyond normal monitoring of the bank.  That always rubbed me wrong that regulators had the power to search without  a warrant but they do now.  
And thats why ME direct access to your machine is a bad idea.  Get ready for the zero days, folks.  
SMM code too, perhaps? Fritz chip internals?  
r/datahoarder get on it  
Maybe opensource devs can use this data as documentation for opensource firmware.  
Unfortunately not, this is still proprietary unlicensed code owned by intel - you can't use knowledge gained from studying it as the basis for open source reverse engineering efforts.  For example, WINE (a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Linux) won't accept contributions from anyone who has seen windows code.  
Leaks have been previously used as a basis for documenting previously undocumented hardware; this is supposedly court-tested for cases where the documenting people and the implementing people never mix except via unidirectional documentation. Similarly, cryptographic signing keys (such as for firmware upgrades) have been judged uncopyrightable; though as a practical matter a court couldn't put that genie back in the bottle anyway. So you're right in the trivial sense, which isn't what happens in the real world. And I wish I could've had your username.  
You have to take care that it‚Äôs ‚Äúclean room‚Äù The issue isn‚Äôt whether you‚Äôll win the court cases. It‚Äôs whether you‚Äôll have to pay for protracted legal proceedings and if doing so will bankrupt you.  It‚Äôs best to just avoid this like the plague if you work on such projects or plan on doing so.  Here‚Äôs a tweet from the Dolphin project about the recent Nintendo Leaks https://mobile.twitter.com/Dolphin_Emu/status/1257051968045899776  We cannot use anything of any sort from a leak. In fact, we can't even look at it. Dolphin is only legal because we are clean room reverse engineering the GameCube and Wii. If we use anything from a leak, Dolphin is no longer legal and Nintendo will shut us down.   
Emulation is quite different from utilization of actual hardware.  If you're just using hardware that's sitting right there, you don't have to worry about keeping a 'clean room' mindset.  If you are planning on writing an Intel processor emulator, on the other hand - hands off!  
Reverse engineering is legal, and it would be hard to prove whether the information was reverse engineered or gleaned from the leaks.  
couldn't they clean-room it though? like what happened to IBM?  
Wine team does clean-room everything, that's why they don't accept contributions from people who have seen Windows code.  
I don't think you understand what that term means. Clean room implementations are specifically ones where someone looks at the thing you want to implement and gains intimate knowledge of how it works. This might be by studying source code, reverse engineering, whatever. Then they document the interfaces in terms that do not include any copyrighted material (e.g. just APIs and such). Then a second group work from that specification. So what /u/QuerulousPanda was asking was whether a team could document the interfaces in this code and then open source developers could work from that documented interface. The only problem here is that they are almost certainly going to claim trade secret status. That gets murkier, but there are still ways to deal with it.  
I think the whole idea of a clean room implementation is specifically avoiding referencing the original code. A hypothetical "Dirty room" implementation would be copy/pasting  
You have one team look at the code and write down some non-copyrightable facts about the hardware, like "you must set this register to this value before setting this other register", and then the other team uses the non-copyrightable facts to write their whatever.

 WINE (a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Linux) won't accept contributions from anyone who has seen windows code.  What if someone just lied and said they hadn't seen the code? How would they know?  
They probably wouldn't.   But they want to stay safe so MS doesn't sue. Or in case they do, so that they can claim that it was an accident or that they didn't know person x did copy code.  
"yes my name is bob and I've never seen intel source code before" at this point the community of computing hardware/software producers is owed this by intel for their immoral cooperation with various state actors.  
There's a weird cult-like worship of copyright laws in America. People think that big corporations can magically own forbidden knowledge. It's very bootlicky.  
In this case it‚Äôs more just not wanting to get sued, like in Oracle v Google.

Devs of drivers? No. Security researchers? Hackers? Christmas came early.

This. Anyone who wants to have open source firmware absolutely cannot ever look at these files. It's the same boat that console emulator devs are in.

Annoying that these leaks are always reported without linking to actual leaks. Hint: there's a magnet link mentioned on 4chan. Saying this much can't be disallowed. If it is so then it might as well be wrong to mention existence of the leak.  
SPECTRE 2.O BABYYYYY  
Apparently the person who runs that Twitter is in the habit of doings leaks and stuff. Makes me wonder how they, and others who do this stuff a lot, aren't constantly getting arrested and stuff.  
Actually leaking stuff or ‚Äújust‚Äù making it public are two different things - that person is basically a journalist  
An oft overlooked benefit of being open source: not having to worry about this.  
Honestly, i feel bad for Intel. They were such a great company back in the days...  
A lot of complacency in recent years though. Lots of quality issues, broken 10nm process, now broken 7nm process. Looks like things systematically went wrong after some point.  
About the point that marketing became their core competency. Maybe after the success of  ‚Äúintel inside‚Äù.  
I think that the turning point was Skylake(as Apple confirmed).  
A bit before Linus' walk in the rain video. They still had a chance to turn the ship around with each subsequent launches. Didn't tho.  
25 years ago?  Intel inside was the marketing strategy for the original Pentium processor IIRC.  
I mean, pentium 4 was broken to the core and Intel was engaging in extensive and illegal anti-competitive practices (fined $1B for it) at the time. They only got saved because their small Israeli team happened to have a mobile architecture with a new paradigm that had some legs (strip everything back down, build back up with a focus on performance per watt, and cut features that do not fit the guidelines even if they boost performance), and said architecture  happened to scale up extremely cleanly into the desktop power space/Core processors. Intel coasted on that for a very long time.  When you consider that during this time NVIDIA went from a 10B company to a 250B company by capturing stream compute and now ML compute, AMD leapfrogged Intel with a solid chiplet architecture using Jim Keller, a dirt shed, and some monopoly money, ARM continued to dominate the entire ultra-low-power space... the list goes on... Intel starts to look like Microsoft when they missed the wave of dotcom innovation. Really, given Intel's dominant position, Intel should have been expected to nail a lot of those markets, and go above and beyond that by innovating and doing some market making through innovation. The only thing sadder than Intel's total miss on so many valuable spaces is Intel's horrific failures with Larrabbee, mobile processors, and aimless wandering in IOT. There are some notable exceptions like 3D Xpoint but not enough.  
That particular mobile architecture (Banias and later Dothan) that formed the core of all following architectures ultimately was a tweaked Pentium 3 core with more instructions, more L2 cache, and Pentium 4's FSB. It's successor, Yonah (Core Solo/Duo), added SSE3, tweaked SSE/SSE2 implementations, NX bit support, and native dual-core. Conroe, Kentsfield, Merom, Allendale, and their Xeon and Low power equivalents would all form the Core 2 line, and aside from some tweaks and more L2 cache, introduced native 64-bit instructions. Penryn, Wolfdale, and Yorkfield would form the second gen Core 2 chips, which were fabbed on 45nm, would add more tweaks, and a ton more L2 cache and clocks. Interestingly enough, while the quad core was a pair of dual-core dies on the same package, intel's Dunnington Xeon was a native 6-core CPU. Didn't last too long because... Nehalem showed up, and started the Intel Core lineage. Lots of changes, a good chunk of the architecture got reworked, monolithic quad-cores with an integrated triple channel memory controller, turbo boost, the return of Hyperthreading, and the switch away from FSB to Quick Path Interconnect, Nehalem was a beast that still, to some degree, holds up today. Nehalem 1.5 (Westmere/Gulftown) would form the basis of all of the first-gen 32nm CPUs, and would introduce the architecture in the form of Arrandale to mobile. Interestingly, for the dual-core CPUs, they used a chiplet design: a die built on the 32nm node would host the 2 CPU cores, while another die built on the 45nm node would host the IMC, graphics cores, and other external connections. Sandy Bridge would come next, merging everything into a monolithic die and adding a great number of tweaks and optimizations, creating the beast we all know and love. It would also be the last of the classic planar transistors, as Ivy Bridge would shift over to 3D-Trigate finFETs. Everyone else shit the bed during this transfer over as they thought ~20nm planar transistors would work. NOOOOOOOOOOOOPE. Everyone else got stuck on 28nm planar transistors while their relevant fabs and foundries worked out how to make finFETs. From here the Tick-Tock cycle would start in earnest, with a proven architecture getting tweaked and then put on a new node, before that node, now refined, is used to host a new architecture. It started breaking down with Broadwell's release because 14nm at the time was a pain in the ass. Once Intel got Skylake going they were doing good, but then their fabs completely and utterly dropped the ball, and we've been getting -Lake revisions for 5 product cycles now, which have been increasingly irrelevant tweaks and instruction sets driven by ever higher clocks.  
Probably when they started putting marketing folks in charge of engineering decisions.  
And finance guys in charge of the company.  
Yeah, one of the best companies at bribing the industry to push AMD to near bankruptcy.  
How far back are we talking? I've heard some stories even as far back as the late 90s/early 00s where they treated their engineers pretty poorly.  
I was talking about the 8088/8086 days...when the x86 came out. When Moore was still there.  
I don't and neither should you. They've been price gouging the market for years after they worked with manufacturers to force AMD out of the market. Intel gets what they deserve.

Makes you wonder if Apple decided to cut ties with Intel knowing some of this stuff.  
There was a former Intel dev a while back mentioning that Apple was by far the biggest contributor of bug reports on some of the later platforms.  
Apple basically tried making an ARM laptop with the iPad pro. Turns out it's great, and an ARM Mac is just the obvious next step.  
And the hits just keep coming for Intel.  
What does this mean regarding Intel ME, does this have the potential to make libreboot possible with newer CPUs?  
Hard to believe the top comments aren't re: the backdoors. I'm both astounded and unsurprised they exist.  
This is a mature and intelligent commentary on the leak, https://twitter.com/juliorcorzom/status/1291488516778541056  
I like how the person's response sums up to, "not my problem".  
Hmm 90 days before Intel voting booth machines get shoved down our throats because "pApEr mAIl vOtInG is InSeCuRe"  
If I know my old coworkers at Intel, most of this 20GB was made by 12 people while 40,000 people got credit for it  
I‚Äôm so happy I own AMD stock  
That's a pretty over-the-top soundtrack for the F12 key  
You wouldn't F12 a car!  
Dude I was trying to turn down my brightness the other day and accidentally F12ed a federal government website... I'm so scared, never closed out of a window faster in my life.  
First you F12ed and then you Alt+F4ed  
You wouldn't F12 a baby!  
You wouldn't F12 a policeman and then F12 his helmet. You wouldn't go to the toilet in his helmet and then F12 it to the policeman's grieving widow. And then F12 it again!  
To be fair the SSNs were encoded with base64.  So basically 1% more secure than plain text  
It's not obfuscation at that point, it's just encoding. Base64 is not a secret.  The people that should be charged are the people trying to raise criminal charges in the first place, for wrongful prosecution. That, and the developers that created this and the project managers that accepted the work should all be investigated for squandering taxpayer funds.  Maybe we the people should press charges of gross incompetence towards the governor.  
 It's not obfuscation at that point, it's just encoding. Base64 is not a secret.   Seriously. Plaintext to Base64 is like changing ASCII to UTF-8 and saying, "it's now more secure".  
Remember when Adobe used ROT-13 as hyper secure cryptography? And then tried to prosecute someone who "cracked" ROT-13?  
In fact it's almost the opposite of obfuscation, as it is easily recognisable and screams 'Check me! Someone might be doing something insecure!'  
To me that's actually worse, since it indicates that at some point someone knew that the application could leak sensitive data then went about trying to mitigate that in the absolute stupidest way possible.  
Fun story: I once was asked to track down a bug in an in-house HR application for people to check their paystubs. It was related to login stuff, so I was tracing through the login code, only to see that your session was maintained by writing out a cookie containing a base64 encoded user-ID. There was no validation beyond that- if you set the cookie yourself, you wouldn't get prompted for a password.  
Was there a lesson people got taught at some point that base64 was some kind of magic encryption that didn't require keys and so it could be used for this kind of thing? I've come across so many instances in my career where base64 has been used in this way. The most recent was a password reset token that was essentially a base64 encoding of the username you wanted to reset the password for. Anyone could reset any password knowing only the username. That code even had a class called Base64EncryptionManager. Checking where it was used though I found it wasn't, they had switched all usages over to the PlainTextEncryptionManager that just returned the input. There was also an unreferenced AesEncryptionManager where the key was just hardcoded.  I don't work there anymore.  
What happened after that? Did you tell anyone? Did it get fixed?  
That's not the reason it was encoded. The reason it was encoded was that someone stored the data in a general purpose user side data store, which automatically uses base64 to avoid string handling problems.  
I haven't followed the analysis but your comment has me curious. Are you saying the SSN data was delivered to the client side in plain text then encoded for local storage?  
[deleted]  
Oui, vous avez raison.  
Is this the elusive hacker Four Chan?!?! Get him!!!  
 To be fair the SSNs were encoded with base64.  Holy cow.  Can you imagine the level of dysfunction during development?  Not only did none of the programmers raise the alarm*, but neither did anyone reviewing the design.  And there was obviously no independent security review...  all for a government website. I bet this was outsourced.  In other countries, government ID numbers aren't considered a secret or sensitive like the SSN is in the US.  When immigrants come to the US, they have to be warned not to give anyone their SSN. It would be interesting to know who did the work. * Maybe someone did and they were ignored, which is just as bad.  
The problem with big, well funded projects like this is that the project manager will often keep a "risk register" of things discovered during development that in any rational and sane world would require them to go back around and address after a development cycle. I can almost guarantee there's a risk register somewhere for this, with this on it alongside a bunch of other vulnerabilities and the signature of the "responsible client manager" of some government crony who is supposed to be the "liason officer" for the project right next to all of them to signify it's not a big deal or "within acceptable risk profiles", which is code for most of them to say "I do not know what this is, or why it's a big deal, but it will stop my project and the only thing that matters to me is signing this project off on time so I can take the money and leave this company while putting a success on my CV." I've been around many project managers and only a very small percentage of them were worth the paper their "risk registers" were printed on, responsible client liason managers even less so.  
This made me laugh so hard. You think a government website is a big, well funded project. Let me tell you. I am a web developer for a government in the US and our 4 person team isn‚Äôt very big or well funded. I have been the sole developer on all my projects and there is no such thing as a project manager or code reviews. If I have a question, like what to do with employee SSN, (real life example I had to deal with), I ask my boss or just do what I think is good.  
[deleted]  
One way is that the client might have asked for a view in the application that wasn‚Äôt in the original scope so to not extend the project out another 2 months they duplicated the code for the closest existing view an removed the all parts they thought had private data.  
You are making me cringe, yet my experience tells me me that the probability of this approach is far to common.  
It's the anti-technology and anti-science agenda that is behind this nonsense.  As a Republican, he has bills to pay and this is the way you can cash those checks.  
I cannot believe someone paid money to make this video.  
It looks like the video is the same quality as the site: they didn‚Äôt even change match the grading for the background image and the superimposed video.    They really should stop hiring family memhers.  
Someone in the YouTube comments even pointed out that the power outlet on the left of the TV is not North American. They couldn't even be bothered to use american stock images!  
You mean to say that somebody in the YouTube comments hacked the video by noticing a detail that wasn't meant to be seen.  
He looked at the mp4 and hacked it to see that the outlet wasnt american. A normal person will not be able to see it because it just flies by so he had to hack it to pause the TV!  
You need to up your cynicism level: * Denying the truth and doubling down is now a viable path when facing criticism * This kind of video moves the Overton Window, making a similar response in the future more socially acceptable * At least some people will be convinced by this kind of content * This plays perfectly well into the narrative of ‚ÄúBig Media is fake news‚Äù and systematically continues to dismantle objective truth while reinforcing the existing paradigm his supporters live within This is blatant disinformation. Edit: Given how effective the impact has been I imagine the return on investment is pretty good. You can even get the content amplified, have external actors fan the flames of the controversy and have your point of view shared widely for free.  
Overton window   The Overton window is the range of policies politically acceptable to the mainstream population at a given time. It is also known as the window of discourse.  [ F.A.Q | Opt Out | Opt Out Of Subreddit | GitHub ] Downvote to remove | v1.5  
Is this satire? I can't tell anymore.  
Unfortunately, no.  He held a press conference to announce he was pursuing prosecution.  https://youtu.be/YBqw5sqa9q4  
Any sane jury or judge would end this quickly. If there's a conviction I sincerely weep for the future of our people because the pure stupidity of this is mind blowing.  
There actually has to actually be prosecution first which is unlikely to happen. This wasn't produced by the governor but rather a PAC.  
Yeah but this is also Missouri, I have a feeling they could pretty well manage to bring and convict this case It would absolutely be turned over, but not before destroying some poor dudes life followed by paying him a ridiculous sum of taxpayer money for this idiocy  
Doesn't matter. The purpose is for the Republican governor to be able to shout to the hicks that the wicked DemonRats and their Fake News Media are trying to steal your private information. Truth and reality don't matter. Either he's going to just let it fade into the background noise after he's gotten his boost, or he's planning a second wave of outrage when the judge inevitably throws out the case or the prosecutor refuses to bring it forward. Then he can have a rant about wicked DemonRat judges and prosecutors protecting pedophile data thieves so vote for him and he'll stop them. ‚Äã Even if he was dumb enough to believe what he's saying, and I don't think he is, he'd have plenty of advisors who know what actually happened. Therefore the only reason for him to be doing this is propaganda. The fact that he's already got a commercial about the evil Fake News shows that it is, and always has been, just an opportunity to attack a newspaper that didn't give him fawning favorable coverage.  
 sane   You see, there's your problem right there  
That part I knew, but you're telling me the ad is actually real? I'm so glad I'm not an American right now. Scary stuff.  
Yep. Even Government Cybersecurity Experts are encouraging him to back down.  
I'm trying to figure out if he somehow thinks this could be a way to get votes from an uneducated base?  Like, this guy is off his rocker  
 Even Government Cybersecurity Experts are encouraging him to back down.  Thank fuck for that. Imagine how concerning it would be if they agreed with him.  
In germany a whitehat is beeing sued by Merkels Party because she made them aware of a potential weakness in their System, so theres that...  
That was withdrawn, after a huge outcry of at least the CCC and not that favourable coverege in the media.  
Anyone can buy ad time. It's not illegal to view the publicly available source of a webpage.  
I'm a front end web developer and he's my governor. I'm expecting the secret police to come seize the HTML decoding hacker technology on my computer at any moment.  
Surely the only thing that will happen is the judge will write a sternly written letter explaining the 1st Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  You can't prosecute journalists for lawfully exposing government incompetence.  
The most telling thing for me was when this first made the news a bunch of Twitter people started talking about how we needed understanding for the governor, and we should educate him politely. Meanwhile, this Maniac is attempting to file charges against someone for looking at the source to a web page. I can't help but get the feeling that there are a lot of people attempting to pull cover for this guy. It's insane to think that he could speak to a prosecutor for more than 2 seconds and still walk away with the thought that charges are ever going to be filed.  
There‚Äôs Rs in this very sub stating that the dude pushing some of the most massive education cuts ever seen by any state ever in the history of the USA is somehow now ‚Äústanding up for educators‚Äù. You can‚Äôt make this shit up. The journalist is the one standing up for educators by revealing security flaws that exposed sensitive information.  
This is why satire is in trouble. Satire is clever people thinking up the stupidest thing they can. Stupid people can delve way deeper than that.  
The Onion almost went under when Trump was president. Satire can't compete with that level of batshit crazy. No writer of satire could come up with the president changing a weather map with a Sharpie.  
The Four Seasons fiasco will sit in history alongside the people of Hartlepool hanging a monkey because they thought it was a French spy.  
‚ÄúOh I‚Äôve got it, ‚Äòwild fires are caused by space lasers!‚Äô‚Äù ‚ÄúThe fuck do you mean someone said that?‚Äù ‚ÄúJEWISH space lasers?‚Äù ‚ÄúLike are the lasers jewish, or ‚Ä¶ fuck it, I quit.‚Äù  
Never argue with an idiot, they‚Äôll drag you down to their level then beat you with experience.  
The channel is seemingly owned by the same-named PAC that supports the idiotic governor. This ad is real because it's from his own idiotic supporters.  
That‚Äôs kind of the point. I see this as a conscious means of continuing to move the Overton Window in regards to what is acceptable behavior and a blatant attack on truth. Take a look at this DHS report about disinformation and see how many alarm bells go off with this kind of content.  
Is that report on a website? I don't want to dig around in html code. Can you post it to Facebook for us?  
 I don't want to dig around in html code.  Good to see that some people on this sub still live by a standard of ethics.  
Even though I know this comment is sarcastic the truth of it makes my heart hurt.  
I think that's getting too clever... this guy is trying to turn around an embarrassing report in the newspaper by accusing the reporter of hacking.  
What is really sad is how effective this ad will be with the older generation. If you use the word ‚Äúhacker‚Äù and any technical sounding words following that, they shut down and just agree.  
You know what would be even worse? Creating some sort of hacking software that automatically parses the "HTML code" and displays the results in graphical form for easier reading of the contained info! It's a good thing no one has done that!  
They say Microsoft has been working on it for around 30 years without much success.  
lmao  
Very Edge-y  
Whoa whoa whoa! "parsing"? You mean DIGGING?!  
Street slang for doing the parse includes "navigating", "exploring", and "firing the fox".  
Wow. They actually decoded the HTML? Sounds very serious. Did they also put a timer on the website warning about doomsday? Quick! Let's lock them up before this gets out of hand!  Is there no one to talk some sense into these morons?  
To talk sense into someone, they first have to be willing to listen to sense.  
G...guys I accidently hit f12 on my keyboard???? Is the FBI going to come after me?!  
Sorry, I've been listening in on the radios, and they're coming after you. RUN  
You mean you've been digging around in openly broadcasted radio signals?!!  
Not just the HTML, he also decoded the CSS and the JavaScript code too! This menace must be stopped!  
Did he use the pretty-print button in Chrome? The maniac!  
If we let this stand, we could be seeing an epidemic of cross compiling CSS into ARM64 microcode.  
 They actually decoded the HTML? Sounds very serious.  I just decoded the english in your comment, am I gonna go to jail now?  
You give someone a Word document of your Resume. At the bottom of the document, you put your password to your login on a job portal, text colored white on a white background, so it's hidden - just so you don't lose it. That recruiter accidentally highlights the password while reviewing the document and says "hey, I noticed what looks like a password. I'm not going to use it, but I wanted to let you know that it's a bad idea to do this." And you make it your life mission to sue the living shit out of that company for hacking your text document with this hacker's feature that lets you select text with your cursor. It's just as insane  
I was trying to think through how I‚Äôm going to explain this to my 70+ year old aunts and uncles; This is the perfect metaphor to get the idea across, thanks  
Lucky. My parents don't know what a word document is or that you can color text. Might have better luck saying they left a password under the keyboard at a public library hoping no one would pick it up for any reason.  
Or if you need an old timer analogy, say you wrote the code to your personal savings safe using lemon ink, and the HR person accidentally left your resume next to the window, where it's sunny, revealing it.  
Another good analogy: Imagine a stranger shows up at your door with your wallet, says "I think you may have lost this. I just found it on the sidewalk over there, took a look at your ID and realized you were right around the corner so I wanted to drop this off right away before you panic." The wallet is just as you lost it, no money taken, all your cards and IDs safe and sound.  And your reply is "I am calling the police, how dare you steal my wallet and home address!"  
[deleted]  
Yes. But only the ones that return it to you get sued. The people who kept the wallet for themselves are fine.  
Here from /r/all with basically no programming knowledge. Thank you for this analogy, I thought it was something like this, but then I thought surely the governor of Missouri isn‚Äôt smearing someone for viewing publicly available information. Guess they are.

I could scroll all the archives of the internet and not find a reaction face expressive enough for this stupidity  
If this is the case, I've broken the so called law a couple hundred times by now.  
üö®üö®üö®üö®üö®üö®  
The state broke the law when they failed to protect teachers PII with this piece of shit website.  The gov is trying to spin this as politics to avoid legal accountability.  
Shame on you.  
This guy right here officer  
As a web developer, I break that law for a living.  
I accidentally hit F12. Should I even bother with a lawyer or just go on the lam now?  
Well it says "digging around" so I'd say as long as your not looking around you should be fine. AVERT YOUR EYES!  
I don't only decode html... I edit it too, I even use a tool to run custom scripts and scripts on pages (greasemonkey/tampermonkey) I'm going straight to jail

[deleted]  
I think "highway patrol" is just what they call "state police."  
Yeah, this is the case in many states.  Kinda silly looking at first glance though  
So.the state published ssn numbers of teachers on a public website and wants to go after people for looking at them? Is that the gist?  
This is one of the worst like-to-dislike ratios I've ever seen on YouTube. I have to wonder how 6 people hit "Like" on this video. Was it accidental? Internal employees? People who legitimately are concerned about <F12> and its dangerous implications? Crazy stuff going on.  
honestly, I didn't realize this wasn't satire so I was about to click it because it was hilarious.  
The count of "likes" isn't very precise on youtube.  The value shown kinda floats around the actual value.  
Yeah, my first thought was vote-fuzzing like on Reddit.  
He was voted in, which means he has supporters that share the same level of tech literacy. Someone out there is looking at this and thinking "thank God for Gov Parsons protecting us from the hackers!"  
It's ok to not know how something works. There's simply too many things in the world for everyone to know everything about all of it. Which is why you surround yourself with experts who can fill you in on things.   This guy is actually just a moron for ignoring his advisors. Anyone browsing this sub is fully aware, but the governor is basically saying it's a crime to read a book at the library, that the library made available for you.  If you don't want people looking at teacher's SSN, then don't hand that data out to everyone browsing your site. Or just retire, you absolute dinosaur.  
If ahything we should be suing him for failing to protect his employees.  His incompetence cauzed the leak in the first place.  
how is this even real....  
Republicans.  
I hate this fucking timeline. These literal scum get to just make shit up an lie about everything with absolutely zero consequence, but can potentially, and gleefully try to ruin other peoples lives. This governor should be the one facing charges for lying, abusing the court system, harassment, starting a witch hunt, let‚Äôs throw negligence in there for the website maybe even doxxing since it had these teachers PII in it basically in plain fucking view for the WORLD to see, etc. the list goes on. But no this simpering little shit isn‚Äôt gonna face any negative consequences and that‚Äôs the most disgusting part about all of this.  
We should be suing keyboard manufacturers for providing an F12 button in the first place!  
At the beginning I thought he was dumb, now clearly it's been explained to him so now he's just spiteful. Get over it you loser.  
Shit. I'm an official old timer, but I remember looking at website code while learning html. This is messed up.  
The F12 key literally brings up the page source in modern browsers. Its insanely messed up  
Thanks for all the reports!  The mods reserve the right to make exceptions, and in this case an exception is being made. No, this is not programming, it's more politics. These exceptions are rare, and I want to personally thank you all for the high quality reporting in this sub.  
Thanks! To help make it a little more relevant to programming I'll provide some organizations that help programmers report security issues anonymously and without fear of prosecution:  https://docs.hackerone.com/hackers/disclosure-assistance.html https://www.ccc.de/en/home  
[deleted]  
Can we get some smarter people in power? Thanks.  
HTML Isn't code. It's a markup language. It says so right in the name - HyperText Markup Language. Furthermore, is the governor implying that the only authorized and legal way to access that website is with a modern GUI-based browser? what about lynx? where do we draw the line? Arguably, the client computer is not property of the state and any data intentionally sent by the server is considered authorized data (as the state sent it) and it is the responsibility for the client to render that data in whatever way it sees fit. Some lawyer is going to destroy this guy's entire career.  
[deleted]  
Be a cynic all you want, but it's not going to look good for that dude's career when something comes out along the lines of  "social security numbers were leaked because I hired my teenage nephew to code the website and I tried to destroy a man's life to cover it up." In politics, they call that "bad optics."  
[deleted]  
Well, something fishy has to be going on. There's no way a professional would have coded-in this kind of security flaw, and there's no way a politician would go full scorched-earth like this unless there was a pretty juicy skeleton on the other side of the door.  
I mean, for a Republican politician, it's great optics: there's a witchhunt to discredit him and liberals are protecting hackers. He might not get elected, but he'll get a nice stipend doing the talking head circuit on Fox News, conferences, etc.  
And how is this message going to get to anyone? This is all already obvious public information, and yet you see in OP‚Äôs video they can dominate the narrative with something else they fabricated. Losing the case is not going to change the narrative for anyone who listens to them.  
Yep. If you don't want people routing around in your HTML stop making your HTML publicly available. It's (kinda) like posting up your diary entries around town and being annoyed when people read them. (Can't think of a real world analogy for a markup language.)  
Here's an analogy: you check a book out from the public library. The appendix contains an entry with the author's credit card information that she accidentally typed in while trying to order something off Amazon. Someone finds it and notifies the publisher. The author decides to sue that person for identity theft, claiming that only a criminal would read the appendix.  
The word "code" isn't that well defined. I would consider HTML to be code.  But I'm not sure why that is in any way relevant.  
ASCII is also a "code"  
Yeah HTML is definitely code. The term people commonly misuse for it is programming language, which it is definitely not.  
Even if we assume F12 is hacking, how is that "fake news"? If the guy actually hacked your shit website and got the Social Security numbers, then reporting that it's possible to hack the website and obtain the SSNs isn't "fake news" it's accurate news. Is it possible for this Governor to be this clueless, or is this just cynical posturing?  
 Is it possible for this Governor to be this clueless, or is this just cynical posturing?  Yes.  
This is insane. Apparently now you are a hacker if you can read.  
Oh no, I just hacked you, I'm so sorry!  
Why aren‚Äôt the devs of that gov website being criminally charged for having ssn numbers in html ?  
Wait, am I understanding it correctly that this is basically "We sent social security numbers to every client of our website, and you found out. That makes you a criminal!"  
[deleted]  
Imagine being the developer that implemented this. You want to quietly fix it and just bury your head in the sand, but this asshole just won‚Äôt shut up about it and now your colossal fuck up won‚Äôt leave the international news cycle.  
[deleted]  
if reading html code is criminal, are all the web developers criminals?  Why is reading html from the web supported by every single web browser?  This dude needs to reel it back, and quick.  He knows about as much about computers as Mozart.  
 This dude needs to reel it back  He seems to be ready to start executing people.  I wouldn't put any money on this stopping.  
We live in a post truth world.  
This kind of security breach is the result of complete incompetence by the people who developed the website. The governor of Missouri should sue the fuck out of the contractors who built this website, he would get a NICE settlement. Would 100% win too. Also might get a court order to fix the website.  
It‚Äôs tricky, however, if the Web Developer is a friend of the Governor who has also built several dozen other Missouri Government sites.  
This is like, if they left their SSN inside the glass case of the fire extinguisher in their lobby.  Like, sure, the average person isn‚Äôt gonna look there, but it‚Äôs certainly not secure.  
Hell, it's not even that. It's like they wrote those SSNs in a letter, put it in an envelope, mailed it out to people, and told people not to read past the first page.  
I don‚Äôt think they even told people not to read it.. Just like, hoped they wouldn‚Äôt?  
That's exactly the analogy I was thinking of. Except they mail you a list, tell you what row yours is in, and expect you not to look at the others. Even better would be to have a space cut out on another sheet, you're supposed to look through.  
And then prosecuting someone for the act of opening the fire extinguisher case, finding the SSN, and warning them that the fire extinguisher case is not a secure place to store personal information.  
‚ÄúWar is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.‚Äù  
Anyone who uses the term ‚Äúfake news media‚Äù should be disbarred from ever holding office.  
Press F12 to pay respects.  
Wait what? SSN in HTML code? What was it like, <!--comments-->?  That's not a security breache! that's literally posting it online.  
Wait...this isn't a parody? This is a serious video? What world are we living in?  
It is truly fucking embarrassing being from Missouri. They are wasting tens of MILLIONS on this bullshit but god forbid they extend Medicare that was VOTED on by the people. This shit makes me livid. Edit: whoops thought this was a politics sunreddit haha.  
 The paper says it delayed publishing the news to give the department time to take steps to protect the information.  https://fox2now.com/news/missouri/missouri-education-department-website-hacked-teachers-data-exposed/ So the paper did everything right except that the governor didn‚Äôt want to be embarrassed? What a joke.   The governor said not only will the state hold the person behind the hack accountable but also those who aided the person and the media corporation that employs him or her.  (Sorry, governor, but the person behind the hack is whoever hired a web development company that doesn‚Äôt understand the first thing about security. Reminds me of the time I worked for a federal contractor and I had to explain to them why we must require the passwords to go over HTTPS instead of HTTP like they‚Äôd been doing‚Ä¶)  Gov. Parson said this incident alone may cost the state $50 million. He said the incident is also diverting workers and resources from other agencies.  If it cost them $50m to remove social security numbers from a website, they have bigger problems. I wonder how much they paid for the site in the first place! /s  He also said the Cole County prosecutor has been made aware of the hack and the Missouri Highway Patrol‚Äôs digital forensic unit is also involved.  What a buffoon.  
Adobe:  Adobe is planning to end-of-life Flash. Specifically, we will stop updating and distributing the Flash Player at the end of 2020 and encourage content creators to migrate any existing Flash content to these new open formats.  Google:  Chrome will continue phasing out Flash over the next few years, first by asking for your permission to run Flash in more situations, and eventually disabling it by default. We will remove Flash completely from Chrome toward the end of 2020.  Mozilla:   Starting next month, users will choose which websites are able to run the Flash plugin. Flash will be disabled by default for most users in 2019, and only users running the Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR) will be able to continue using Flash through the final end-of-life at the end of 2020. In order to preserve user security, once Flash is no longer supported by Adobe security patches, no version of Firefox will load the plugin.  Microsoft:   In mid to late 2018, we will update Microsoft Edge to require permission for Flash to be run each session. Internet Explorer will continue to allow Flash for all sites in 2018. In mid to late 2019, we will disable Flash by default in both Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer. Users will be able to re-enable Flash in both browsers. When re-enabled, Microsoft Edge will continue to require approval for Flash on a site-by-site basis. By the end of 2020, we will remove the ability to run Adobe Flash in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer across all supported versions of Microsoft Windows. Users will no longer have any ability to enable or run Flash.   Looks like Flash will be completely dead by the end of 2020.  
 Looks like Flash will be completely dead by the end of 2020.  Kongregate :'(((((((  
Aw damn, I gotta get my adventurequest fix in before its too late

IKR? I almost audibly went "oh shit" when I heard the name. Even though it's "only" been 4 months since seeing some people at GDC working on some project. Guardian upgrade was probably the first "microtransaction"  I ever bought. EDIT: heh, still even remember my old login after all these years.  
Oh man, I had like one really fun day on that when my Runescape membership ran out. That takes me back...  
I've been visiting their games forums for a while now, it seems like Artix is gonna try porting over their games http://forums2.battleon.com/f/tm.asp?m=22278120  
They'll probably switch to Shumway.  
"Latest commit 16451d8  on Mar 29, 2016"  
Maybe there's not much point doing it in ASM.js when WebAsm is coming "soon."  
Still painfully slow, after how many years of development? It's not really a viable drop-in replacement.  
Visiting their site made my phone come to a crawl.  I recommend flash developers start learning haxe. It codes practically the same but compiles to html5  
We'll have a few more years of progress to throw at it.   
I just get the "Oh, Snap" Chrome error halfway through loading that page every time. Am I doing something wrong?  
Nope, I literally cannot load that page on Chrome. Looks like the work's coming along?  
This is, in all seriousness, kinda depressing. There's lots of old flash games I love to go back and play from time to time, that I'm fairly sure the creators have long since abandoned and have no interest in porting. I'm sure you could download them, run them on an old browser version in a VM or something, but it's kind of a pain in the ass, and definitely beyond what most casual players would be willing or able to do. I hope they build some kind of legacy sandbox to allow you to still enjoy old content in.  
There's a standalone Flash player available on the Adobe website somewhere. It's buried in the developer downloads. You're looking for a filename like flashplayer_sa.exe. It plays Flash files completely standalone, in its own window, no browser required. However I'm not sure if it supports Flash files that try to download from an internet URL and certainly won't work with Flash widgets that rely on accompanying JavaScript to run them. However I've used it with a number of Flash games and Flash animations and it generally works fine. http://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html Click "Download the Flash Player projector"  
Homestar :'(((((((((((  
Some of them are on youtube. But :'((((((((  
Easter eggs though Edit: And the games  
THE GOOD TIMES ARE OVER!!!  
A lot of developers on Kongregate are already using Unity so no worries.   
[deleted]  
Unity player isn't supported anymore by Unity itself either. It's moved on to HTML5  
Ahhh. I didn't know they both stopped supporting it. That sucks badly. Unity is a great tool.   
I wonder if Microsoft will do the same for ActiveX.  It's been a while so I'm not even sure ActiveX is alive any more.  
[deleted]  
Oh man that's definitely still alive :-/  It's been a notorious security risk in the past at least.  
[deleted]  
Go look at Korea .. their official government websites, and any site that uses banking info, or any personal info whatsoever, by law has to be an activex "secured" mess. Plus flash is everywhere, and Unicode as well as any form of accessibility are constant problems. ActiveX refuses to die haha  
Edge doesn't support ActiveX already. The problem is in corpo drones who jumped on the bandwagon when it was the next shiniest thing and now they don't want to lose all the bucks they invested into that garbage.  
The use of WinXP past EOL shows that they won't give up even when the product is dead.  I'm not sure what else can be done  
The botnets that infect old, unpatched computers will eventually help take care of it.  
 they don't want to lose all the bucks they invested into that garbage.       From business perspective, they don't want to reinvest piles of money for new tool that will satisfy business need that was already dealt with just because there are new shinier things.  
Lots of misinformation in this thread, so I'm hijacking the top comment. Adobe will only end support for the Flash Player. The animation software that used to be called Adobe Flash Professional was rebranded to Adobe Animate, and will continue to be developed and supported by Adobe.  
What does that mean for users of that software?  Will it render to HTML5?  
It has for a while now. Even before they rebranded it.  
Not well.  
it has done that for what? 2 years now? I'm sure that at least for 1 year  
Which was an awesome move. Flash - the software - has been a pretty awesome authoring tool for anything from cartoons to infographics to spliced up PowerPoint presentations for a while. It's great that we can get rid of the bad (Flash Player/SWF Files) and improve the good (authoring software). I've recently looked around for similar animation tools, and wow, the choice is between mediocre free apps (think GIMPs UI, but for animation), some online cloud subscription HTML5 apps (the majority it seems) and Flash Pro/Animate. If someone wanted to pay e.g., $150 for a good Windows application for animations, it seems that none exist. It's Adobe Animate or Suffering, it seems.  
  Flash will be disabled by default for most users in 2019, and only users running the Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR) will be able to continue using Flash through the final end-of-life at the end of 2020. In order to preserve user security, once Flash is no longer supported by Adobe security patches, no version of Firefox will load the plugin.   So what happens to all those Flash games on Newgrounds etc? I just don't get to play them anymore?  
Sadly 10 years too late.  
Yeah, no joke.   I started in the industry with flash, and even earned quite a lot from it. But it's way waaaay overdue to die.  
Kinda better this way, honestly. Wouldn't want to be a dev in it 10 years ago when it started dwindling and get the rug pulled out from beneath me.  
Kind of sad really... the technology was pretty cool, but it just had no future on mobile without a ton of re-work that Adobe wasn't willing to do.  That, and the ridiculous number of vulns :/  
Oh no, BARRY!  
Apple: See?! We fucking told you so!  
[deleted]  
 played a role in pushing companies away from using it.  if we don't count the multiple vulnerabilities found every month, multiple updates every month to fix those vulnerabilities and the countless articles on how flash is used to infect computers, take control of them, etc... Apple's decision was because of these security issues and not because they were visionaries, I think that flash had great potential and did what it was supposed to do when it came out, now it's obsolete  
 Apple's decision was because of these security issues and not because they were visionaries,  Not really. Security issues related to Flash maybe contributed to 5% of Apples reason to not use flash since everything is sandboxed the effect a virus can have is essentially meaningless. The primary reasons are as follows.   The main reason bar none is that it's a third party development layer and Adobe had been pushing developers to create apps with it's technology. This creates a barrier between the platform and  devloper and Apple believed that would lead to substandard apps and hinders the enhancement and progress of the platform. Developers would not be able to take advantage of the latest platform enhancements until Adobe makes it available. So with that, Apple simply did not want their product to be at the mercy of a third party.   ¬†  Flash is a closed standard, not open as Adobe would like people to believe. While Apple has many proprietary products, when it comes to the web though Apple believed all technology should be open.   ¬†  Performance was also a key reason. The number 1 reason for Mac crashes was due to Flash. Apple had tried to work with Adobe for many years but with no real resolution. Apple has asked Adobe to prove to them that Flash could perform well on mobile devices, which Adobe was never able to do.   ¬†  Battery life was known to be a problem with flash, and this went against Apples efforts to get as much battery life out of their phones.   ¬†  Flash was designed for mouse, not for touch. For example, many flash sotes relied on a cursor "rollover" and with touch, the concept of a cursor is no longer applicable leaving users not able to see or use parts of many flash sites.   
 Apple's decision was because of these security issues and not because they were visionaries  I still believe that Apple's decision was mostly to cut off access to free online games/apps and make their App Store walled-garden model seem more necessary. Flash was huge at the time, with large corporations making games and other software to target it, I just think it would have been hard for Apple to sell anything themselves with all that free content competing on the same platform. And that's fine, history has shown that to be a great business decision, but I don't like seeing it spun as some benevolent/selfless act.  
You're right. Apple's decision 10 years ago was obvious and met with no controversy. Flash's demise was clear to all at the time, which is why this is a headline in 2017 with companies talking about ramping it down by 2020. So obvious.   
I wonder what will happen to all the games and animations of Newgrounds. I really love that site, and I confess I spent a lot of my time watching the superb animations from so many amazing creators in there.   
[deleted]  
It's Adobe, I feel that's a good reason.   
They've done it before with the Flex framework  
They may feel there's IP in there which they still want to protect. Though they are probably wrong and should. But it's Adobe...  
Might not even be about wanting to protect IP.  There might be code in it that was written by contractors/consultants many years ago that they actually do not have the right to open source. That's one of the reasons the CDDL is incompatible with the GPL, despite what whiny Linux nerds will tell you‚Äîthere were a lot of drivers and other code that absolutely needed to ship with Solaris, but that code could not be open-sourced because Sun did not own the rights to the code and didn't even necessarily have a way to contact the original creator(s). IP laws are complicated, especially when the rights span multiple countries.  
I didn't know contractors/consultants got to dictate the licensing of their work.  
Open sourcing proprietary programs is more complicated than simply sticking it on your Github instance with a GPL license.  When you open source the code, you have to go through each module to check to see if you're using those modules with any of your other applications.  You also have to ensure that all of the code you publish is code you actually have the right to relicense.  It's very common for one companies' code to include libraries or modules from other places that you might be allowed to use internally to your own code, but that you can't relicense. Basically, it's a pain, it gets lawyers in a twist, and when you already have 'open' versions like Pepper Flash around it doesn't necessarily make sense to spend the dev time working on it.  
Pepper Flash isn't open and little is known about it. There is a high chance that it is a version of Adobe Flash to support Chromes Plugin API because if it didn't contain IP Google would probably have wanted to open source it.  
 there's no reason not to  Correction, no good reason not to. They could not release it just to be assholes.  
The animations aren't a problem. A while ago (long before Flash was phasing out) they made Swivel, which converts SWF to MP4 pretty flawlessly. Currently any animations you watch on NG are being played on an HTML5 player. It's actually lighter weight and has more functionality than SWF did, but that's sorta Adobe's fault for "slow-burn" deprecating their own format. Games are a bit different though. I think NG now accepts Unity and HTML5 games, but there's no way to convert the previously-made games into those formats (afaik). Until there's a solution for that, it means a LOT of the old Flash games on NG won't be functional in your browser. Maybe Adobe will make some sort of format interactive SWF's can be converted to without losing their functionality? I'm doubtful tbh. Sidenote: Adobe Animate is pretty fantastic on a lot of levels, but I do know some animators are still working in Flash. And also the video/frame timeline in Photoshop CC is pretty tolerable for fbf animations.  
I was surprised to see that a Newgrounds comment was so far down. Am I that old, that the majority of reddit users probably don't even know what Newgrounds is? Or was Newgrounds never that popular to begin with...  
I hear flash is dying and my mind jumps to things like Newgrounds and I think surely this is The End of The World. And Australia was like, wtf mate?  
Lol nice. You're dating yourself though. But who cares...FIRE ZE MISSILES  
But I am le tired.  
yeah, its like everyone forgot about the ultimate showdown  
Of ultimate destiny  
Good guys, bad guys, and explosions  
Newgrounds was my first experience to porn. I remember the choice of games quite fondly. I think I still remember the speedrun strats to get to the better scenes.   
Meet n fuck babyyyyy  
Oh God. I remember those... H-how well do they hold up? Asking for a friend of course.   
Yes! HBO's lazy ass will finally be forced to get rid of their horrible Flash web player  
And crunchyroll... Some of the biggest platforms are such dinosaur...  
Crunchyroll content is available on VRV which uses HTML5.   
VRV isn't available in all the regions Crunchyroll is.  
Crunchyroll has has a "beta" html5 player for a few years now I think.  
Only for premium plus members... Complete rubbish and I dropped my subscription when they lowered the bitrate recently.  
HBO is light-years ahead of the competition in terms of content creation. HBO is also light-years behind the competition in terms of content distribution. They have the slowest, clunkiest, most unintuitive streaming platform out there. It's even worse than Crackle and I've never even used Crackle.  
I've used Crackle. It's worse than Crackle.  
The stupid HBO GO app doesn't even show you the programs you watch. Every time I want to watch Last Week Tonight, I have to use the search function because there's no other way to find it.  
Hopefully the MLBAM team is working on a new solution for this since they handle the streaming component for HBO.  
The only thing I want from that god-awful player is for the cursor to be hidden after being still for a few seconds. I hate expanding the screen on the newest GoT episode only to sit down on the couch, see the cursor, and get up again to swipe it to the side.  
Press the comma key to hide the cursor :)  
They can safely replace it thanks to the DRM integration of the "open" standards promoted by W3C.  
Oh shit is that why I can hardly watch anything with them?  It's crazy frustrating for any video to buffer every 30 seconds these days.  
Who is going to migrate Homestar Runner?  
Or all of the content on Newgrounds?  
How active is newgrounds these days? I have a lot of fond memories of it's earlier days but haven't been back in probably close to a decade. I wish there was a website or community that better served amateur/Indy animators.  
Youtube and Vimeo took over online distribution of most of the indie animation content out there, although recently Youtube fucked over a ton of indie animators by changing their ad revenue algorithms and content guidelines for monetized videos. There's tons of artists that post there. And Patreon is finally a decent platform for funding them for their projects. The Tales of Alethrion series is one of my darling favorites. Gotta love Sexual Lobster, Harry Patridge, Oney, FlashGitz.  
The good times are over!  
So Homestar will be Baleted? No more Cheat light switch raves?  
Goddamn, I was not prepared for the feels trip in this thread.   
Se√±or Cardgage, at your swivels, good Belinda.  
The Brothers Chaps should create on-demand Linux VM's running never-updated browsers with Flash. Spin one up at the viewer's expense. (Old-Timey Homestar appears: "Insert a quarter to see the show, Mister.") There's a whitelist so you can only visit homestarrunner.com.  
But what about all the old Flash games?  
[deleted]  
But will websites still host them?  
RIP Newgrounds :'(  
So I get that people hate Flash now, but for a long time, Flash WAS the cutting edge of interactive design, and it was awesome. Honestly, I don't see that level of experimentation or creativity in interactive stuff these days (either on desktop, web, or mobile).  
Agreed. I'm not a fan of Flash anymore, but back in the day, I remembered the endless amount of Flash games available on the web that kept me entertained for hours. I think, now with the rise of Steam and other game distributors, the appeal to use Flash for animations and games has dropped. JavaScript could replace Flash entirely with new libraries and implementations, but I don't think anyone is interested in web games. I still think, though, JavaScript/CSS animation will continue to be a big part of the web.  
I agree with all of that, but remember that most people (but not most people on this sub) primarily use smartphones and iPads for this sort of thing now. Phone games replaced web games. Desktop computing has really fallen off.  
[deleted]  
Not just you. But you're part of an increasingly small number of casual gamers who feel that way. A lot of people probably haven't even touched a mouse in years.  
I don't think anyone is choosing to play video games on their phone OVER playing on their desktop: actual gamers are still going to be playing on pc/console. All of the phone gamers are people that either wouldn't play games otherwise, or people who are playing when they are not able to play on their home systems.   
Ah, I forgot about mobile gaming. Yes, that's probably the biggest factor. I know a couple of my friends who built small Flash games moved to learning Swift, Unity, and Java to build mobile games to get into the expanding market.  
 Phone games replaced web games.  But they are nowhere near as good. The amount of amazing free content on Kongregate is still above what you can find in app stores, even including paid ones.  
Flash ads were always annoying but apps developed in Flex (basically Flash with a decent UI toolkit) just worked without a lot of the tweaks and browser-specific code.   Plus you had javascript with type safety so you could build large applications and refactor them confidently with solid tooling. HTML5 is here to stay of course but it in many ways is still a lot of steps backwards when you're trying to develop business apps.  
Not to mention that you could write complex web apps using Flash/Flex without having to spend days trying to figure out how to center something.   
Ehh... It was still pretty loathed in its prime in tech and poweruser circles. It made the processors then cry for the sweet release of melting.  
[deleted]  
Yeah I was running a full version of flash on my phone in 2010  
won't anyone think of the hentai games?  
Someone has to migrate SuperDeepthroat!  
And Liru...  
Ironically it outlived Steve Jobs...

 Where a format didn‚Äôt exist, we invented one ‚Äì such as with Flash and Shockwave.  Adobe, you didn't invent shit. You bought Flash from Macromedia.  
Who bought it from Shockwave. Hence the extension swf - shockwave flash   
[deleted]  
I said it back then, and I still think I'm right. Adobe did the wrong thing with sticking to Flash. Flash wasn't what was valuable to them, their creation tools were. Flash, the piece that ran as a plugin, was dreadful in every possible way. Adobe should have built the best HTML 5 authoring tools as soon as they could have, and been very active on every single standards board related to it. HTML5 could easily have been a stand in for the flash runtime if they had done that. Think about how we use png and jpeg in web browsers, but Adobe makes Photoshop. The insecurity of it all was enough for me to abandon Flash a long time ago. No software is so good as to make up for it being that insecure. (Also changing the user-agent sometimes makes it possible to view mobile versions of web pages on the desktop, thus ignoring flash:))  
The problem is 'Flash' is actually a bunch of different parts and people naively associate it with obnoxious banner ads from the early days of internet (or are just repeating stuff without any understanding of what Flash was). Flash was an amazing animation tool Flash was an awesome development ide (AS3) that could cross compile in order to make solid desktop and mobile apps Flash was a browser plugin meant to play the output of the other above two tools and pushed the capabilities of what you could do in the browser for a long time. Unfortunately that also means it often had security issues, turns out when you have to access the OS instead of just displaying very limited html that it is harder to secure. Also since it ran in a browser for most of its life it did not have access to hardware acceleration which meant you were running graphics and games on pure CPU. Surprise! That is of course not going be good performance. AND the majority of our experience with Flash was on much slower computers where even AAA games built in C++ had limited graphics.. so I'd say it did a pretty fucking good job. But of course most of the top comments are "har har I haven't used flash since __ ", "derp flash is trash" because hating on Flash makes idiot programmers feel part of the herd.  
No, flash was a great technology for the reasons you described, yet used mostly by terrible programmers to create terrible sites that took ages to load, were unparsable by search engines, without ability to link to inner pages, with poor security and heavy on you computer's resources. I still remember fondly the time I used to play flush games, but nowadays the same can be achieved with html, and in a few years much greater would be achievable by WebGL and such. Besides, at a certain point support for Firefox on Linux started to suck major cock. Flash was the best we could wish for 5 years ago. But today it is obsolete, and good riddance.  
Yeah also, remember web video before Flash? Exactly. There basically wasn't any. Flash was the only solution that even vaguely worked. It was shit in a lot of ways but it did have some positive effects.  
I actually do. Embedded realplayer and quicktime videos, and downloadable wmvs. It was even more disgusting than it sounds.  
You must upgrade your version of realplayer in order to play this video.   
[deleted]  
Yeah, seriously. I see people in here crowing about the death of an evil obsolete technology and it's like they just don't care about the giant cultural trove of work made with that platform. There was a really good Lego flash game, years ago, called The Nightfall Incident. It was on a really old version of Flash, so old it was still called Macromedia Shockwave, and to play it these days step 1 is 'set up a Windows 7 VM'. Pretty soon step 2 is going to be 'download old versions of the browser and Flash from whatever dodgy website comes up on Google'. Pretty soon a decade and a half of glorious variety of Flash games and animations are going to follow suit. That's pretty sad, especially when so many people seem aggressively keen to accelerate the process.  
That's what I keep thinking about, too. However people feel about them now, places like Newgrounds were a huge part of early internet culture. Flash going away without necessary exports will turn all of that content into a locked museum with the lights turned off.  
You're correct, for historical purposes it would be a shame to see all the Flash content of the internet become unreadable.   
One option is to download the SWF and run Flash Player outside of the browser. If push comes to shove, you can run a VM and install Flash and a version of Firefox which is compatible with it. Heck, that's probably safer than running Flash natively. In addition, Mozilla developed shumway, a Flash VM and runtime written in JavaScript. I don't know how well it works, though. Once Adobe finishes killing off Flash, I'm sure we'll see an electron+shumway alternative to Flash Player, if there isn't one already. Sadly, this is one of the risks of depending on a closed source plugin. Adobe could gain some good will from the tech community if they open sourced Flash once it's EOL'd.  
 Adobe could gain some good will from the tech community if they open sourced Flash once it's EOL'd.  Yeah, like Python 2's EOL is 2020 as well, but there is no way that an organization like Anaconda won't maintain a fork.  
oh fuck, someone save all the e621 flashes  
deleted    What is this?  
Flash studio has been dead for a release or two and is now known as Adobe Animate, transitioning away from Flash.  
Flash (the editor) exports HTML5 now. It doesn't support everything Flash Player did, but it's enough to create content. We have SVG, we have HTML5 2D and 3D transforms and other effect filters, most importantly we have WebGL which allows unprecedented performance and control over graphics. Plus, the web needed Flash for cartoons because bandwidth was scarce and video standards on the web were non-existent. In the MPEG4, Netflix and YouTube age, that's no longer an issue. So you can use any professional animation packages, or draw on napkins and take photos, doesn't matter, as long as you can make a video out of it, you're good to go and publish your work on the web today.  
The problem isn't creating new content, it's playing the existing content. There's a lot of flash content out there that come 2020 will be unplayable unless you setup workarounds. If there's a way to convert content then sure, I'm all for killing flash, but until then there needs to be at least some way to play flash, even if it's just a desktop application that you drop SWF's in to.  
Does this mean my knowledge of ActionScript 3 is worthless in 2020?  
Adobe AIR roadmap was updated today and is not a part of this end of life cycle. Adobe plans to continue supporting AIR. https://forum.starling-framework.org/topic/air-roadmap-update  
Good thing they bought out Macromedia.  
Is JavaScript the new Flash?  
No. Flash success was the combination of the plugin and the IDE. There isn't such a popular well-known combination today.  
Pretty much yeah.  What with WebGL and all that it pretty much replaced flash entirely.  
Sooo... where are all the cool WebGL / HTML5 games.  
good luck with that one  
Former Flash animator here...There isn't even a remotely usable animation tool for html5 out right now. They killed flash without a working successor. Flash is now animate cc which creates some javascript crap that's not remotely as performant as flash. Also html5 never was ment to be a successor, it's not as good for those things. And companies don't like to hear that it's 10 times more complicated and will cost a lot more to produce.  
I'm with you.  Everyone says "oh you can do everything you did in flash with JavaScript and html5." Nope sorry you can't. People who say that didn't use flash.  Where is the html5 alpha transparency for video? And don't hand me some crap canvas hack that only works on chrome.   
There's a lot out there?  At least the potential, here's a procedural RPG I made: http://myonlyfriend.azurewebsites.net  
We have the equivalent of Flash runtime, but we don't really have anything that comes close to the simplicity and power of Flash editor.  
WHAT ABOUT MY FLASH GAMES?!?!  
I like that, now-a-days, you can easily disable Flash on websites. I see this as a feature of Flash :).  However, the same is not true of HTML5 autoplaying videos. Even with browser extensions, certain websites keep retrying to play and these retries sometimes succeed if you scroll.  
Have you tried NoScript(for FF) or uMatrix(for FF & Chrome)? They can block video/media requests from reaching your network in the first place.  
Adobe should open source the compiler and format (swf).  
Way ahead of them.  I already end-of-lifed Flash in 2014.  
Former Flash Artist here. The most important thing about early flash was that it allowed a Graphic Interface for artists like me to create animations and motion graphics without code. Without Code.  The important thing about flash was it allowed Graphic Artists to maintain control of their art and animation. It was the early days when artists still had a voice in the game. As flash progressed, it was overtaken by web coders, because the BigBusiness machine needed more power, and they hired coders to corrupt flash and make it more and more code based, and discounting the graphic interface that made it so great in the early days. Since then, web creation has moved from art and design, over to coders. Coders won the war, which is why every website on my iPhone looks nearly identical: Divs, Columns, Boxes. This is what coders wanted, not what artists wanted. It went from being something really cool and fluid, to something boxy and boring.  I am sad it will go, but maybe it's like Photography: when black and white photography, developed on film and printed in high grain on Ilford paper meant something artistically, and it was creatively important. Now photography is a Instagram square enjoyed for a millisecond.  RIP Flash. Hope we can get a new graphic interface soon...  
Now Silverlight needs to die the horrible death it deserves.   
Silverlight is already dead, Microsoft pronounced it by the end of 2012. True, the official end of life date is 2021, but it's not unusual for Microsoft to support its technologies for much, much longer than anyone using it and the low adoption rate (ignoring Windows Phone) certainly played a role in MS abandoning it so early (it lasted roughly 5 years). That being said, even though I dislike it (and browser plugins in general), I never had any issues with it. It did work rather well, although I don't want to think about the implications if it was as widespread as Flash.  
Wait... it's still around?   
This is the best tl;dr I could make, original reduced by 78%. (I'm a bot)   Specifically, we will stop updating and distributing the Flash Player at the end of 2020 and encourage content creators to migrate any existing Flash content to these new open formats. Adobe will continue to support Flash on a number of major OSs and browsers that currently support Flash content through the planned EOL. This will include issuing regular security patches, maintaining OS and browser compatibility and adding features and capabilities as needed. We plan to move more aggressively to EOL Flash in certain geographies where unlicensed and outdated versions of Flash Player are being distributed.

Really wish I could take a peek at how SMMRY does such an excellent job recognizing crucial keywords to give these amazing summaries.

Adobe Animate CC (formerly flash pro) is still worth learning. It can export HTML5 canvas animations, and is not a part of this end of life cycle.  
So should I start going around to smaller business sites to find flash apps that will no longer work and offer to build something new in its place?  
I'll miss Flash. Back when every browser behaved differently and none of them supported SVG, having a way to create vector-based animations and games that worked consistently across all major browsers was amazing. Maybe HTML5 will reach that one day, but currently there's still differences between browsers (particularly in Safari)  
I was a flash animator/developer for almost 15 years, and I made a pile of cash doing it. While I've moved on to other platforms, and I do agree it is now time for it to go, many of you probably don't realize what a game changer Flash really was. An animator once described flash as "finding a suitcase full of money" and "a one man animation studio". Prior to that creating animation on your own was an unbelievable task. And getting a large audience to see it? Forget about it. And for indie game developers? A complete... game changer. The turnaround times that could be accomplished in flash was unmatched. Sure it had it's flaws like anything else, but I think we all owe something to the platform. See ya pal.  
My work just switched our time sheet system to a flash only website. My work is stupid  
2020 Headline: FLASH MISSING VANISHES IN CRISIS  
Such a shame. I owe most of my interactive development career to Flash. It gave me the freedom to build anything I wanted in a time of browser wars and inconsistent standards. Although HTML5 and browser consistency has improved...the creation tools are lacking. I have moved on as well to Unity/VR and no longer focus much on web based content. The web is now the domain of video and simplistic design forced on us by the world of smart phones. The internet has died a little and lost that spark that made it an exciting & weird place. Thank you Flash. Thank you Macromedia. Thank you adobe. Steve Jobs....you can go flash yourself.  
That's sad. Flash is what was opened a doors for me into programming and into gamedev. Very convenient platform for games, since it was working everywhere, looked and worked the same on every machine. Even after stopping working with it, it was nice to know that the games are still out there(newgrounds, kongregate and hundreds other portals) for people to find and play. Oh well  
Haxe and OpenFL are great for anyone looking to port and support HTML5 + webgl output along with other native platforms. Have using Haxe for a while and I can't sing its praises enough particularly for web app and game dev.  
 Where a format didn‚Äôt exist, we invented one ‚Äì such as with Flash and Shockwave.  Poppycock, Adobe. You didn't invent it, you bought it.  
Here's the extension zip files that were archived from the Chrome Store. You can get all versions back to 1.0.   https://extensions.crxcavator.io/ohceakcebcalehmaliegoenkliddajoo_0.0.12.zip https://extensions.crxcavator.io/ohceakcebcalehmaliegoenkliddajoo_0.0.13.zip https://extensions.crxcavator.io/ohceakcebcalehmaliegoenkliddajoo_0.0.14.zip  They are CRX (Chrome Extension) files, some manual steps needed to unpack, or change .zip to .crx and open with Chrome. i.e. Drag the CRX file into the Extensions page, after you toggle Developer Mode to on in there. https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/q3smfr/unfollow_everything_developer_banned_for_life/hfus51x Install Instructions: https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/q3smfr/unfollow_everything_developer_banned_for_life/hful17d  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect  
Thank you! Now I just have to learn how to install it on Edge lol EDIT: rename it to .crx and it will work!  
Should not be too difficult, since you can install chrome extensions directly. There should be a manual install somewhere.  
Yeah I found out they're not really zip files, but renamed crx files, that's why they didn't work :)  
crx files are renamed zip files ;)  
Just go to this link and download the given program. Then follow this guide, and you should be able to install without any issues.  
How do you add this to Chrome?  
Down load the zip. Unpack it to a directory. Smart people, with the required coding skills as well, they look at the .js files, remove any trackers/phone home code. Then Chrome -> Settings -> Extensions -> Turn on Developer mode -> Load unpacked Find the extension directory, select it and then click Open. The extension is now added to Chrome. It'll load from that same location, so make sure it's a permanent one as Chrome will look each time it starts up.  
I tried unzipping on my mac and my pc and it says they are invalid  
The website seems to have put some crud at the start, not sure what. They still unpack though. md5sums:    4f0410290f1fbcd3db037797268625b4  ohceakcebcalehmaliegoenkliddajoo_0.0.12.zip   d59a1d0ad0485de1d5135e8d8522093e  ohceakcebcalehmaliegoenkliddajoo_0.0.13.zip   c37681b9458a3ce4447fcfbd99046ff4  ohceakcebcalehmaliegoenkliddajoo_0.0.14.zip    $ unzip -t ohceakcebcalehmaliegoenkliddajoo_0.0.12.zip   Archive:  ohceakcebcalehmaliegoenkliddajoo_0.0.12.zip   warning [ohceakcebcalehmaliegoenkliddajoo_0.0.12.zip]:  1321 extra bytes at beginning or within zipfile   (attempting to process anyway)   (files listed here...)   No errors detected in compressed data of ohceakcebcalehmaliegoenkliddajoo_0.0.12.zip    OK, yeah they are CRX (Chrome Extension) files. (shocking huh)... i.e. a ZIP with 1321 bytes of CRX header prepended. http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/android/android-4.0/external/chromium/chrome/common/extensions/docs/crx.html  Looking at the header the 'Cr24' is the clue:   $ od -c < ohceakcebcalehmaliegoenkliddajoo_0.0.12.zip | head -2   0000000   C   r   2   4 003  \0  \0  \0 035 005  \0  \0 022 254 004  \n   0000020 246 002   0 202 001   "   0  \r 006  \t   * 206   H 206 367  \r    The advice would be to open a Terminal on a Mac, a Command Shell on a PC or a shell on a Unix host and manually unzip them. You can still unpack them, don't take the GUI's "no" for an answer. You shouldn't need to use some (always risky for viruses/malware) third party CRX unpacking software, unzip seems to cope.  
Exactly, they need to be renamed as crx.  
You just rename it to .crx and Drop it to the Extension page on Chrome in Developer mode. It denied me to install it from any other page.  
You can just use this link. Worked fine for me:   https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unfollow-everyone-on-face/pijkodjelolnmbehifeokihlodnajela?hl=en  
Or you can move over to a federated social network that doesn't rely on corporations. Federated social networks allow for smaller instances meaning if one instance goes down, several other are still operating. Supported and regulated by the people and not business. Fuck Facebook  
 Or you can move over to a federated social network that doesn't rely on corporations  That works great as long as the only people you want to be connected with are equally as informed, enthusiastic, and willing to put in the legwork as you are. You're basically just advocating for ditching Facebook. Which is fine. But let's not pretend there's an alternative. Your choices are Facebook or nothing.  
Your forgetting G+! It has these amazing circles that allow you to share and view content from specific groups of friends.... Oh. Right. They dropped the ball and shutdown that project too. Never mind. :(  
Actually did try to use G+ during my no-facebook years. It was moderately successful, in large part because there was a surprising amount of adoption in the online RPG-enthusiast community. I even ran a D&D game on Google Wave (remember that?). But nobody I knew IRL actually used G+.  
Google+ could have been awesome, it came out right at a time when people were thinking about ditching Facebook when "ditching" major social media was still feasible (they'd mostly ditched Myspace for Facebook somewhat recently). But the invite only system killed G+ nobody wanted to wait and announcing something before people can sign up en masse was not a good way to go.  
 You're basically just advocating for ditching Facebook. Which is fine. But let's not pretend there's an alternative. Your choices are Facebook or nothing.  This. I'm not happy with facebook, but that's where my friends and family are and they aren't leaving anytime soon.

I'm not happy with facebook, but that's where my friends and family are and they aren't leaving anytime soon.  Mine too. Everyone thinks I'm some kind nut for refusing to use Facebook. They keep calling me a pain in the ass. Yet somehow I still get invited to stuff and even participate in organizing family reunions.  
[deleted]  
I'm sure you probably have thought about this but it is possible to stay in contact without Facebook: text, group text, phone call, group phone call, video call, group video call, in person visit, gatherings (with precautions). It can be hard to be the first one to move as it seems like you are abandoning everyone else, but think of it as building and selling a new home for your friends and family without the creepy landlord. Couldn't we all do with less zuck right about now?   (and if you want centralized photo sharing etc... well /r/selfhosted is waiting for you. So yeah, no lazy alternatives to the zuck but don't say there are none or you will never be free of the zuck.)  
What's actually working these days? I read about Diaspora a long time ago but it doesn't seem to be active.  
Diaspora is pretty active (though I guess activity is a subjective term). Last code commit was eight days ago and there are stats on its federated usage.  Mastodon: Twitter Alternative Pleroma: Twitter Alternative diaspora*: Google+ Alternative Friendica: Facebook Alternative PixelFed: Instagram Alternative Aether: Reddit Alternative   
Mastodon.social is the only one I know about.  
I've been thinking it would be cool to have everyone host their own social media on a raspberry pi server at home ever since I heard about the "protocols not platforms" movement, have you heard anything about that?  
This really sucks. I feel bad for this dude, if you read the article, he makes really good points. There aren‚Äôt really great alternatives to FB when it comes to staying connected to lots of friends and family without also being bombarded with ads and conspiracy theory crap. Since I deleted Facebook a few years ago, I‚Äôm more active in making photo galleries and sharing them direct with friends and fam via iCloud and text message- the downside is that type of shared content isn‚Äôt aggregated for everyone so you have to do all the user management yourself.  
Return to monke myspace  
Man is that still a thing  
It kinda is. Some German kid launched an old school MySpace clone that has something like 140k users. https://spacehey.com  
Just signed up lmao  
Today I found a future lawsuit  
I mean, it exists, but I don't think anyone still uses it.  A living web relic  
IIRC it is now a music-focused social network, and nothing is left from the old days.  
I'm using Google photos face algorithm to auto share all photos of my kids with my mom. Besides that I quit Facebook and rely on texts. If someone wants to stay in my life they need to text me. Makes it more personal.  
I created a browser extension that interacted with Facebook a few years back, and also received a C&D letter‚Äîwhere the lawyers managed to spell my name three different ways in so many pages‚Äîonce it went viral. The letter threatened to disable all my accounts, and since I was in the same situation as the author, I promptly complied with their terms: delete all source code, remove the extension from the store. The extension was open sourced anyway and already largely forked by the time I scrapped it, so it‚Äôd essentially become an immutable record on the internet. Every FB employee I talked to about the situation after the fact found the extension hilarious and were shocked to learn of the C&D ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  
What did the extension do?  
Showed a notification anytime someone started typing to you, whether you had the conversation open or not. Creepiest thing I‚Äôve built (yet). It was called ‚ÄúFacebook Sixth Sense‚Äù if you want to look it up.  
 Facebook Sixth Sense  Found it. Also found your blog. Nice writeup.  
How is it possible to do something like that?  
I have a whole write-up online on how it works behind the scenes, but the gist of it is that FB would always send you some data when someone typed on Messenger, but the interface would only show it if you had the convo open. By keeping FB open and listening to those messages, the extension could graph all interaction timings. I expect they‚Äôve since patched that behavior.  
You were the person who did that?? I was thinking about this the other day.  
I posted it here on /r/Programming :)  
Holy shit, I used to use that  
FB devs clearly have a different mindset from FB lawyers.  
It wasn‚Äôt even FB‚Äôs own legal department but some firm they hire instead. I ended up doing an internship there after this happened and, if anything, this experience strengthened my application.  
That's generally true in any big company.   Devs just like seeing people do cool stuff with their platform, because development is about creating things. Lawyers hate seeing anyone do anything without permission, because corporate lawyering is about control.  
I had a similar situation even though the extension I wrote was only ever used by my Wife and I. Must be some automated thing. There was an ebay like group we were apart of, I made an extension that would read the time of the last posted bid and would out bid them with less than a second to go, to make sure we always won bids on thing we were purchasing. Mine wasn't an official letter it was an email from a facebook team(can't remember which) basically saying our accounts would be disabled if we continued automatically posting on a users behalf. I deleted Facebook that year (not due to that incident, due to all the other Facebook garbage) so it was a non-issue for me anyway. They also made a code change and I was no longer able to run the extension for my wife never bothered updating it.  
\ you dropped this  
[deleted]  
[deleted]  
Heh, just came here to mention that. And all the older versions so you can see deltas.  
It‚Äôs gone because of fb  
there is a gist on github: https://gist.github.com/renestalder/c5b77635bfbec8f94d28 not sure if it works... I just googled it ‚Äã EDIT: IT WORKS.  
This does work, but to my disappointment the news feed was not empty after unfollowing everyone. It still assumes you want to see some of your friends' posts no matter what. I thought removing all my "Favorites" would do it too, but that had no effect. I tried logging out and back in too. Edit: Now that I think about it, maybe the posts I see are only those that were already in my feed before I unfollowed everyone? I'll update this comment later today with the results. Edit2: 5 hours later, and my feed in unchanged. I only see posts from before I ran the unfollow script.  
You have to be in a specific menu to make this working. There are instructions in a post on that page (the one saying "down arrow...")  
Wait, this is it? var unfollowButtons = document.querySelectorAll('[data-followed="1"]'); for(var i=0;i<unfollowButtons.length;i++){ unfollowButtons[i].click(); } alert(unfollowButtons.length+' people are now unfollowed! ');  You can barely even call that a plug-in. It's just like, a single for loop. Facebook got lawyers involved over this?  
what the plugin does is probably very similar to this code. The code, to be copied in the browser js console, loops over the pages/friends/groups and "clicks" the unfollow button for you. ‚Äã And facebook's lawyers are after **the effect** of the action, not the action itself.  
[deleted]  
Facebook already released their winged monkeys lawyers. The dev got a cease-and-desist order. I'm sure that uploading the code to Github would cause him to get into more trouble. The problem is, that even if he's in the right legally speaking, Facebook has way more resources to drain him in legal battles. He could very well lose it all because Facebook can just out spend him.  
This doesn't sound like the rule of law. Our society is fucked.  
"Under law all men are equal, but justice goes to the highest bidder"  
"The law, in its infinite wisdom, bars the rich and the poor, equally, from sleeping under bridges."  
Eugh... What meaning of the words "justice" is in there?  
[deleted]  
This is why, as a developer, if you want to actually make a change, you have to be willing to use a pseudonym and not link it up to your actual real identity.  I understand wanting to have credit attributed to you and maybe getting 5 minutes of fame, but it's just not worth it for the legal headache that's going to become your life even if you comply. It's much harder to pull of now than it was a 20 years ago since the internet is full of tracking cookies and such, but it's not impossible.  
True but if you do anything that has just a vague hypothetical chance to end in lawyers, get a effing "legal expense insurance". If they realize you aren't paying your legal fees yourself, it will make it a bit more annyoing for them if you drag them along.  
Unless you're paying 5 figures for the policy itself, the maximum payout isn't going to get you to trial, let alone through one.  
If a punishment has a fine, it‚Äôs only a punishment for poor people  
Lawyers fuck everything.  Us engineers just want to build cool shit but lawyers bend their broken rules all the time.  
 Us engineers just want to  Oh engineers can fuck some shit up too. Not a bad as lawyers though.  
There are supposed to be more protections for consumers against corporations using litigation to bully them. A lot of times its done by a large corp against a smaller business or individual, that is seen as a "competitor." It violates anti-trust laws but since these corporations have expendable cash, they bank on the fact that the individual will immediately comply (out of fear and insolvency), or that they will settle rapidly because of cash and assets being depleted. Litigation shouldn't be so expensive in this country. I'm a lawyer myself and I'm working on ways to make it more accessible for people. ‚Äã Edit: here's an example ROSS Intelligence was a startup that won funding through CLIO's legal development contest. They had a great business model that would allow free access to legal information. A lot of stuff is hidden behind paywalls on sites like Lexis Nexis and Westlaw. Their subscriptions are expensive as hell and it costs like $25 per individual case/article/record if not more. Westlaw went after them forcing the new company to shut down immediately.  
Can they get me in Serbia, do you know maybe? If so give me the code I will put it publicly at my own risk! Fuck facebook!  
Make a new account and upload from an internet caf√©, they couldn't even find you (if they tried).  
[deleted]  
You imply that would actually identify him. Just make a new account and upload from an internet caf√©.  
Nobody is going to sue you internationally for this lol. It's not like you broke into their systems and exposed the code.  
What if someone else uploads something similar anonymously?  
Sounds like it's time for "hackers" to "hack" him and release the source as a leak.  
Can asking politely be construed as phishing? Asking for a friend.  
 The problem is, that even if he's in the right legally speaking, Facebook has way more resources to drain him in legal battles. He could very well lose it all because Facebook can just out spend him.  I'd like to understand this because I see so many times around here. Where I live we have this "Defensoria P√∫blica" (Something like: "Public Defender" in English), where a citizen can invoke the State to help you with a legal dispute, and once accepted the State will be in charge of the costs in case they lose. Isn't there something like this in US?  
We have them. They can only represent you in criminal cases, however.  
can't we just keep the legal battle going until facebook runs out of lawyer funds then?  
[deleted]  
Lol  
Good luck pooling even a fraction of the money that Facebook can.  
"we"  
I was thinking something similar. All that seems needed here is for a martyr to spontaneously come across the code. This person must be someone who has never used Facebook - such that they won‚Äôt be bound by the same provision in the user agreement  
Try the browser extension Facebook Purity. https://www.fbpurity.com/ Blocks all the ads and sponsored posts and puts your newsfeed in the order you want (rather than their algorithm)  
How does FB Purity get away with not getting the ire from Facebook?  
I think Unfollow Everything scripted actions but fbpurity (and similar: Nudge, Habit Lab, ...) block content from being displayed. I'd expect FB is more unhappy and thinks they have stronger grounds to fight against code that is performing actions far faster than a human can.  Unfollow Everything would clean up FB phone apps and possibly change your social graph, but blockers only affect the browser they're run from.  
I've used FB Purity for years and it works pretty well. It doesn't always default to Most Recent like I have it configured but I have most of the side bar garbage hidden and the ad and sponsored post blocking is amazing. When I browse on mobile I realize how much crap there is.  
A couple years ago I unfollowed everything manually and have never looked back. In the absence of plugins to do it automatically, I suspect many would be surprised how quickly they can unfollow everything by just clicking 'unfollow' on everything in your news feed until there's nothing left. Even if it takes time, it is a very satisfying experience during.  
Exactly this. I unfollow militantly and Facebook is now rather useful for finding events. I now get surprised when I see something new to unfollow.  
I have a little over 900 things in my unfollow list - started unfollowing things back in 2009.  
This is what I did. But I also unfriended everyone I knew I'll never interact with in any personal capacity ever again.  
How convenient it is, to just crush studies, browsers, plugins that displease this company ? I mean, user addiction and data is the top 1 income source for this platform (as stated in the article), so I guess they bite hard when someone decide to propagate a way to reduce that for users. That's why I'm now boycotting FB, no users, no power. When I see that a company is ethically doing things worse and worse, I just stop using things related to them (as much as I can at least). They did so many bad things ... After buying the Oculus Rift from Microsoft, they forced users to use a FB account to log in (https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-facebook-accounts-being-banned) and users that hadn't any FB account created a brand new that was almost instantlty flagged as a spam/bot account and get banned. Therefore, they couldn't use the headset at all. Don't event need to talk about the data leaks and the recent services downs for straight 6 hours. The Facebook-Cambridge analytica scandal .. A major bug made some private messages publicated on public feed, made quite of a mess between people. And so on, ... If anybody knows a site where they list Facebook issues I would be grateful, for shaming purpose  
Agree with what you're saying, but wanted to correct this:  After buying the Oculus Rift from Microsoft  Microsoft wasn't involved. Facebook acquired Oculus, which was just a startup with a nearly ready commercial product -- great time to make an acquisition: after they do the R&D.  
Already uninstalled WhatsApp?  
I'm curious, how does WhatsApp generate revenue for them? I've never seen a single ad on it.  
Whatsapp Business. You have to pay for anything outside of a customer initiated message from less than 24 hours ago.  
He got banned from Facebook? Is that supposed to be a punishment?  
In 2011, I unfriended Facebook. I'll never understand how billions of people continue to use it. Like an astronaut whose parents are flat-earthers. It irritates me to see people still using Facebook.  
I quit around the same time.  I had 8 solid years of doing just fine without it, and then I moved to a small community in Iceland, and it's almost impossible to manage without it, so I had to turn it back on two years ago.  Not only does nearly everyone I know use messenger exclusively to communicate, it's pretty much the only place other than word of mouth to buy or sell anything.  The bar I work part time at uses a facebook group for scheduling our shifts.  I know most people don't get put in the extreme case that I was, but I am sure plenty of people feel they'll miss out on a lot without it.  The tools themselves are great.  It's the algorithms, and the profit model that makes it horrible.  When FB was just a chronological feed of things your friends posted, it was fantastic, but that didn't make money, so they turned it into the cesspool that it is today.  
WhatsApp is like that for Germany. You just don‚Äôt have a social life if you don‚Äôt have WhatsApp.  
Europe in general is WhatsApp. I use it to talk to all my EU based friends and vendors, and haven't met a single person there who uses a different texting app. Asia has a couple more options, but they're no better or worse than WhatsApp if privacy is what you're looking for.  
My friends and family switched from WhatsApp to Signal a bit ago and it has been great. It is developed by a non-profit with privacy in mind.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(software)  
I deleted my account years ago, but before I did I found out they have weighting on your facebook feed. If you are not active enough or do not have enough friends then posts you make will not show up on your friends feed if there is content facebook deems of higher value. This was particularly easy to notice because I had previously deleted my account and created a new one(so I'm now using a barren account). After noticing a lack of response in posts, where I used to get them I asked a friend to check. He could not see my wall posts at all without directly viewing my profile. In addition to this Facebook creates ghost profiles of people that do not use facebook, but that it would like to track on any website with facebook plugins. It's incredibly creepy how involved and accurate this is. Finally Facebook are one of the worst companies for clearly manipulating "studies" that show they aren't harming society. I'd be curious to see how many studies they are rejecting to find that one needle in the haystack that says Facebook isn't really detrimental to a lot of peoples mental health.  
 I'd be curious to see how many studies they are rejecting to find that one needle in the haystack that says Facebook isn't really detrimental to a lot of peoples mental health.  they're constantly running a/b testing on their pool of fools. They can get you literally any data you want to pay for.  
[deleted]  
I made a big write-up over on /r/anime_titties the other day, but I'll give a summary: In 2018, Facebook changed their algorithms to make it so you see stuff you're more likely to interact with (warning: Facebook link). So if you react to your wife's posts a lot, you'll be more likely to see her in your feed. (Anecdotally, it seems to also be weighted by who is reacting to your posts -- if my mom reacts to my post first, generally the only reactions I get are from family members. However, if a ex-coworker reacts to my post first, the reactions are all generally from my ex-coworkers. But I digress.) The issue is that different emotions make you more likely to interact with content -- here's a 6-minute CCP Grey video talking about how it works. Basically, thoughts can be equated to viruses with regard to how they spread. Thoughts associated with emotions (except sadness) spread measurably more (see 1:06 in that video for the chart).  But the emotion which causes the most likelihood of interaction is anger. Things that make you angry get shared more, and as they get shared they get modified to make people angrier (which in turn makes them more likely to get shared). The result is a distorted picture of the truth that has been changed more and more to fit a narrative as it goes deeper into the echo chamber. Just like how memes get created and templates get modified over time, so do things that spark anger. So, Facebook has an algorithm wherein content which gets interacted with gets shared more widely. And content which makes people mad is more likely to be interacted with. The result? That algorithm change made Facebook a much angrier place. But that anger led to much more engagement, more time on Facebook, and more money from ads.  Company researchers discovered that publishers and political parties were reorienting their posts toward outrage and sensationalism. That tactic produced high levels of comments and reactions that translated into success on Facebook. "Our approach has had unhealthy side effects on important slices of public content, such as politics and news," wrote a team of data scientists, flagging Mr. Peretti‚Äôs complaints, in a memo reviewed by the Journal. "This is an increasing liability," one of them wrote in a later memo. They concluded that the new algorithm‚Äôs heavy weighting of reshared material in its News Feed made the angry voices louder. "Misinformation, toxicity, and violent content are inordinately prevalent among reshares," researchers noted in internal memos. Some political parties in Europe told Facebook the algorithm had made them shift their policy positions so they resonated more on the platform, according to the documents. "Many parties, including those that have shifted to the negative, worry about the long term effects on democracy," read one internal Facebook report, which didn‚Äôt name specific parties.  This isn't limited to Facebook, by the way; you can see this effect on Reddit as well. Compare /r/politics, /r/conservative, and /r/latestagecapitalism, for example. The main difference is that on Reddit you'd need to manually opt-in to those communities, whereas Facebook does it automatically without you even knowing about it. So yeah, that's the point of Facebook. It's not to show you a feed that gives you updates from your friends; that's the old pre-2018 algorithm. The new algorithm is to maximize the amount of (non-sad) emotions you feel on Facebook, and it's especially good at maximizing anger. That keeps you on Facebook for longer, foments an addiction, and gives Facebook more ad revenue.  
"In 2011, I stopped smoking.  I'll never understand how billions of people still smoke."  
Living abroad it was the only real way to keep up with friends and family back home. I actually intended to drop Facebook when I moved, but ended up far too isolating. Clearly my specific case is more anecdotal than most, but unfortunate as it is, for a lot of people Facebook remains the best tool amongst its competitors for what they need it for.  
 Clearly my specific case is more anecdotal than most  No it isn't. Moving abroad may be relatively uncommon, but untenable isolation as a result of dropping Facebook isn't. It is much easier, however, to post comments on Reddit about Facebook when they are entirely negative, so naturally one sees a lot more of those comments. Someone who writes that they hope FB goes out of business or that they deleted their account, nothing of value was lost, and they're much happier now can just dash it off, anywhere, and expect it to go over without having to worry about phrasing and post quality and context. Otherwise, there's a (rightfully) angry mob itching to downvote given the slightest provocation.  
Facebook has its problems, but through it I've been able to do lots of good things, like expand my genealogy research with groups of people who share that interest.  IDK if it's a UK/USA difference but at least the feed I see on FB isn't full of mad raving cunts, but that might be because I only really follow bands I like and cat groups  
Every time I see these threads I wonder how it can be so different. I don't go much on Facebook. Maybe once a day or so. But I don't see any of the madness people talk about. Just a quick look now at my feed. There's absolutely zero politics or memes. I got a couple birthdays, someone's pregnant, a dad asking recommendations for kids activities over the weekend, bunch of pics of ppl meeting for drinks or dinner, someone got a promotion, some pretty cool pics from the city by a buddy photographer....  
You've curated that content by either ignoring or unfriending people that post political/meme content and your social circle posts personal information to Facebook. None of my friends use Facebook in this way except for event scheduling, which is the only reason I still check it.  
Same. I muted or unfriended all my contacts that bang on about politics and my feed is fine now. Nowadays I scarcely check my feed and only keep FB around for groups.  
You‚Äôre on Reddit. It‚Äôs a social media site with tons of problems and sinkholes for addiction as well. You‚Äôre ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get how people use this‚Äù mindset is equally reflexive to Reddit. I‚Äôm sure it would be perfectly sensible to you why many people use Facebook if you think about it. It‚Äôs not intractable.  
It's tough to stop using it when all of your local friends, businesses, and hobby groups use it as their main source of communication. I paint and play Warhammer 40,000 and Star Wars Legion. The absolute easiest way to find a pick up game is through Facebook Groups. If you're new to the hobby, you have to use it. All my local gaming stores used to pay someone to run their website. They each made a Facebook page for their business and it gets way more traffic than their websites ever did. All of the important news in my small town of 1000 is posted to the local Facebook page. It's easy to brag online about how Facebook users are simpletons, but cutting the Facebook cord would drastically limit my social life, in a negative way.  
Same. I stopped using it in 2005 cause I dont understand the point of it and still don‚Äôt  
I stopped in 2003. Ahead of the curve.  
This thread rn  
Looked at some of your posts, but why do you create things in excel? I mean it‚Äôs cool, but why? Just seems really random lol  
Hey, thanks for the browse. I legitimately find it quite satisfying to make interesting Excel models, I‚Äôm relatively good at the program so ‚Äúwhy not be a bit creative with how it can be used‚Äù is the mantra of the day. Keeps my brain ticking.  
I landed my first programming job thanks to a facebook group. Facebook suck and has a lot of issues but it also has a lot of potential. I don't see any other social network where you can easily create a group of 'tech people living in city x' like the one where i found my job.  
Facebook is what you make it. If it is just garbage, then you need better friends/groups.  
 Facebook is what you make it.  I know what you‚Äôre saying, but it really isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not some neutral platform you can use how you want, in fact it‚Äôs being actively designed to work in Facebook‚Äôs interests and against your own, as this article exemplifies.  
I love my friends, but their friends and their friends' friends are what cause me grief.  
It will still shove garbage into your feed that's unrelated to your friends/groups  
I agree but to an extent. I'm part of a local group of expats in the city where i live, i got tired of people posting covid conspiracies and such, so i started blocking them. My facebook feed has improved a lot but the problem is still there. Misinformation didn't disappear just because i blocked and reported it, other people still see those posts.  
I also did it in 2005. But I had to join back in. I founded a company and pretty much every startup activity was on Facebook and later whatsapp. The parents in my kids school and kindergarten handle all activities via whatsapp. I tried getting people to move to Signal but it's futile. Only a handful make the minimal effort.  I look at Facebook as an advertising platform to the idiots who choose to stay. I go in, do my promotions and leave. I hope it's so filled up with ads and commercial content people will eventually quit it...  
I wonder how many games he bought on the Oculus store...?  
If he switches on his Oculus now he just gets an image of Mark Zuckerberg mooning him.

Easier solution than a plugin: delete your account and never use it again.  
Did you know people can tag you by name in photos even if you don't have a Facebook account? I have an empty Facebook account set to hold all tags for approval, then I just never approve any of them.  
 The loser here is the user, and the cost is counted in billions of wasted hours spent on Facebook.  True... but the winner is Facebook because as the author mentions, they want users to do one thing and one thing only: keep scrolling down the newsfeed, seeing as many ads as possible, all day if possible. Things FB has no interest in their users doing:  have meaningful interactions outside the newsfeed. keep in touch only with people who reach out directly to them, rather than post generic things to everyone and the world (which is what keeps newsfeeds going) to grab as many likes as possible (addictive behaviour). leave after a short, reasonable amount of time, to do more useful things.  The cost for using their platform is that you use FB the way FB wants you to. I have to sympathize with FB here, they spent billions to be able to serve nearly the whole world population, who voluntarily signed up, and now they want their investment to give returns... by clearing the newsfeed, you made their product better for users, but useless to FB... why would FB want people to use their product in a way that generates no revenue to them? Objecting that is only possible if you think of FB as some kind of non-profit, charity or at least a public service... which they are patently not. They are your typical for-profit, multi-billion dollar corporation which has no reason to do anything at all that's not going to generate profit. Anything that they do that might benefit people, they do only as a means to making more money, like any other product company. This kind of discussion seems to miss that.  
Most discussion I see is (correctly) assuming  that Facebook has integrated itself so much into society, to the extent that it is enabling movements that can affect entire populations.  When for-profit companies exert more influence than actual countries and governments, should profit still be their top priority? I'm not sure what the answer should be for that one, but I feel like discussions about Facebook, Google, etc. revolve around this.

Using newsfeed eradicator and I'm very happy with my FB experience. If they ban it I would have to resort to blocking FB in /etc/hosts or something because I can't have newsfeed when I go to FB. https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=news+feed+eradicator&ia=web  
I manually unfollowed everyone a few years ago and eventually got a message that I was using the tool wrong and they would take it away from me. Fuck Facebook  
hehe "using your tool" wrong. They must have been also watching the incognito tab you had open.  
Got a screencap of the message?  
I do.  Fuck Facebook  
That looks like a normal rate-limiting message? You're going to get a similar message if you try to do too many Google searches quickly or do too much upvoting too quickly on reddit.  
Yeah this looks like rate limiting. Props to OP for their clicking speed, though.  
I feel bad if he used Facebook OAuth to login to any of his accounts.  
This is why Oauth / Google/Facebook/etc - Login doesn't work:  Once "the powers that be" ban you from using their platform, you are screwed.   Better to download KeePassXC and create a username/password for each site.  
Why would someone ever do that  
This guy https://twitter.com/WuNeal had a better solution 8 years ago: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kill-news-feed/hjobfcedfgohjkaieocljfcppjbkglfd?hl=en He didnt not face any issues back then though. It simply hides all feed items instead of unfollowing groups, pages etc. I remember seeing it on HackerNews then.  
 Banned for life from Facebook services  You lucky son of a bitch  
I banned myself for life from that toxic cesspool a long time ago.  
I wish there was a Firefox extension!  
looking at the source, it seems like the whole extension could work in Firefox if it used the standard extensions API . Maybe some intrepid coder wants to take that on. Although I have a different question when looking at the source... why does the extension load Amplitude?? That's a user behavior tracking library.  
probably as part of that university study

Facebook: 'we don't own the algorithm, you all effect it as you use facebook!' Also facebook: 'stop trying to mess with our algorithm!'  
Duh‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not messy, that‚Äôs ENGINEERED. Everything they do, regardless of how little sense it may seem to make, is specifically designed to monetize the FUCK out of you, and KEEP you there like the big pile of pliable money you are. Anything that messes with that revenue stream gets cancelled HARD.  
What if the extension were released as a medical application to treat debilitating addiction?  Then if FB launches another Cease and Desist, couldn't you slam them for wanting to hurt people who are addicted to their product?   ‚Äã I.e. Market it like nicotine gum or a patch?  
This is amazing. Do you have any plans to do this for more games? Is it possible to save this code so it will always run Flappy Bird when the game is launched?  
I don't currently have plans for other games. You could write the code to SRAM, which is where save files get stored, but you'd still have to trigger it by using an arbitrary code execution glitch if you reset.  
I don't know much about game hacking, but couldn't you make it execute random code while loading the save, in a similar fashion to how XSS is done?  
That's basically what was used to make homebrew possible on modern consoles, e.g. when Twilight Princess let you write as much data to memory as you want, just by editing the save to never null-terminate your horse's name. Problem is, SMW's save is extremely simple with no strings or variable-sized buffers in sight.  
Haha is that how that one works? lol  
What about enums that are hackily added to pointers, like the "what's in Yoshi's Mouth" byte?  
That'd require a pretty massive bug in the file loading system, but it's possible one's out there.  
I know this can be done with early Pok√©mon games. They just dump a chunk of RAM into the save, which includes a pointer to a function to call every frame. Just load the save and go. With Mario, probably not. I think it only saves a handful of flags for whether each level is cleared. A bigger problem is the possibility that having your code in the save file prevents the game from starting correctly and/or getting to the place to execute exploit, or erasing the "corrupt" save. Some games, such as Donkey Kong Country 2, can actually crash at the title screen if the save data is bad. (Which may or may not lead to code execution...)  
I've wanted to make a 'how glitches ACTUALLY work' video series like this for years. This started when I explained to a friend, who doesn't know anything about programming, why games, especially from this era have limits of 255 for things like lives and coins and it blew his mind. If something that simple has the power just imagine what videos like this could do after a proper series leading up to it with explanations... I started a search and found that there are at least a few other videos of this quality out there that didn't exist just a few years ago... Here are some you might like: And the "Son of a Glitch" series by "A+ Start" Legend Of Zelda: A Link To The Past Wall Glitch - Son Of A Glitch - Episode 2 Super Mario World Orb Glitch - Son Of A Glitch - Episode 1 'DotsAreCool' has some amazing videos too... Super Mario World Credits Warp Explained Super Mario World Powerup Incrementation Explained Super Mario World Yoshi Clips Explained SMW - One Frame Maybe I should put these into a playlist....  EDIT: I made these into a playlist!.  I'll keep updating it as I find more. Really amazing videos there, including the two before this one in the series that explain a lot more about what's going on.  
Amazing stuff. Roughly how many attempts did it take?  
I did it first try :) Of course that's after months of planning and practice.  
 after months of planning and practice  That is... dedication.  
As dedicated as this guy? He's dedicated years (I think) to beating Mario 64 without pressing the A button and has very detailed videos describing the most insane glitches.  But it's not on the level of injecting code, but still dedication.  
Holy crap.  I just spent 25 minutes watching this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpk2tdsPh0A The planning and intelligence that goes into that... I was expecting it to just be goofy running around and, you know, playing Mario. There's math and mapping and planning and.... wow.  
What is this a competition? Either way there's a whole community behind the N64 stuff last time I checked  
SethBling, A year ago I saw your machine learning in Super Mario video. You cited a paper by Dr. Stanley, who just happens to teach at my university. I decided to take his course, AI for game programming, which I am currently enrolled in. I have since decided to apply for an accelerated BS to MS program to learn more about AI and evolutionary computation in grad school. That machine learning video pushed me in a direction I never imagined I'd go in. I am very thankful for your educational videos and how well you explain high level topics to a broad audience.  Thank you :)  
Why are there all these glitches for this game?  Does every game have these weird code replacement things, and this game is just popular enough for lots of people to know about it? Is this game especially poorly-made? Can you explain again what the multitaps are doing, exactly?  
I would guess most SNES games are similarly glitchy, and Super Mario World is probably the best studied SNES game. The multitaps are used to direct the processor execution to the sprite x-coordinate table. We can manipulate the code path so that it reads instructions from controllers 3 and 4. Then those controllers have buttons pressed to jump to the right memory address where we can manipulate more bytes for a larger arbitrary code execution.  
I'm not a programmer, so please have patience with my (hopefully not dumb) question: As far as I understand it, controller ports 3 and 4 basically have buttons pressed that match the value of the beginning of a memory address large (and non-critical) enough to hold the Flappy Bird source code? Thus allowing you to write that data in with the jump-spins?  
Not quite. The controllers point to a memory address that contains the sprite x-coordinate table (for things like Koopas, Yoshi and P Switches). That table is then executed to write a single byte to an unused portion of RAM. And then again, and again. Until there are enough instructions to form the "Bootloader", which is a small bit of code that let me write bytes to another portion of RAM very quickly, with spin jumps. I used the bootloader to write the 331 byte payload.  
How many bytes is the bootloader?  
I assume this was a game design flaw to have the 3rd and 4th controllers have memory space that overlaps with the sprite position table. How do you think such an oversight happened? Did they not know that the system would eventually support four controllers?  
I really need to learn Assembly. I'd love to understand this stuff because it's right up my alley, I love seeing things used in ways that are totally unexpected. This video is done nicely: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv0kZKC6GAM and I like the way he explains it. I wish I had the background to understand this Mario exploit but it's based on so many sub-glitches that it's all going over my head. I wish I could understand the whole thing from the bottom up, as this high level version sounds very interesting. Awesome video dude, keep it up.  
 I really need to learn Assembly.  Here's a very quick introduction to 6502 assembly... or rather the CPU itself. The 6502 uses 8-bit registers, while its successor, the 65816 (which was used in the SNES) is a 16-bit processor.  
I have nothing better to do so im going to try and explain how things like this work in general. Im not sure about the specifics of this mario exploit but this might give you a hint as to what happned in the computer. First you need to know how a CPU works which is quite simple. A working CPU needs two things. A list of instructions to run, a counter which keeps track of where in the list of instructions it is currently executing (the Program counter) and finally, something that can run the actual instructions. For this, you don't need to know how a specific instruction is executed. The list of instructions is usually stored in RAM. When the CPU is running, all it does is repeat the following process over and over again. Fetch the next instruction from memory, execute the instruction, fetch the next instruction. Again, we don't have to worry about how instructions are executed. I said before that instructions are stored in RAM and that the CPU has a program counter to keep track of which instruction is being executed. RAM is just a big list of bytes which can be read by an index. So in order to read what is in position X in ram, you give the RAM the value X, and get the content back. That way, all the program counter needs to store is the index of the current instruction being executed. In normal execution, the CPU runs an instruction, then adds 1 to the program counter which makes it run the next instruction in the list. Now we can have a computer which does something from the start until forever but in order to do something usefull, we need to be able to make descitions.  In order to do that, CPUs contain instructions that change the program counter. These are called jump or branch and can be conditional or unconditional. All they do is change the value of the program counter if a condition is met.  You need to know one more thing in order to understand how exploits like this work and that is how instructions are stored in memory. The simple answer to that is that they are just a series of bytes split into two parts. The last part is data given to the instruction, it is a set of bytes and differs between each instruction. The first part is also a set of bytes which is called the op code. Each instruction in the CPU has a unique op code that tells the CPU what to do. All the instructions are stored in RAM as bytes containing an op code and data for the instruction. CPU instructions are therefore just a set of bytes, just like numbers or any other data. The CPU doesn't know what the content of the RAM is for, all it knows about it is the values stored. This means that code being executed is not treated any differently to data in the RAM. Now that you know all this, you may be able to understand how code injection works. In order to get the CPU to execute our own code, we need to do two things. We need to put our code in RAM and then we need to set the program counter to the start of the code. Because the CPU treats data the same way it treats instructions, we can calculate some values that correspond to instructions and trick the CPU into putting those values in RAM in a place where we can get the CPU to jump to. The tricky thing is finding a way to write data to somewhere that the CPU will jump to. If we have done those two things, once the CPU fetches the next instruction it will run our code instead of whatever code caused the CPU to jump into it.  I may be entirely wrong about this, but it sounds like seth and his friends found a way to write the coordinates of things in the game into a part of memory where the CPU will jump to. Once the CPU jumps to that special piece of code, you can use it to tell it to jump to more code somewhere else in memory where you can write more code.  I should add that modern CPUs have some protections in place that prevents it from accidentally executing CPU instructions where they know that only data is stored so executing random code is harder. Computerphile made a really nice video where they demonstrate doing a similar attack. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S0aBV-Waeo  
The real question: Is your username a Star Control 2 reference?  
Thank you for that explanation, I took a lot away from it!  
Google for "Assembly Language Succinctly" it's a free PDF that gives a great overview in a reasonable amount of pages. Edit: Direct Link (Thanks /u/_F1_)  
?  
Play some TIS-100 :)  
If you're looking to learn some x86, here's an excellent intro. It's probably the most straightforward, comprehensive intro guide I've found, and it's tons of fun to follow, too.  
x86 is probably the most useless one to learn now though. While x86 dominates the PC market almost no actual work is done at the assembly level except some very basic device driver stuff. It's too complex to program a significant piece of assembly code on a real chip. Even 90% of device drivers are mostly C now. IMO you'd be better off looking at ARM or something like AVR, PIC, or MSP430 Assembly as it will be easier to debug and there's less complexity on the chips. EDIT: Okay, there are more useless ones as there are architectures that aren't used much anymore, like the Z80 or the Motorola 6800 series. But of the most common architectures in use today x86 has some of the most complex assembly to learn without the usefulness of many other platforms.  
I'm pretty sure most of these glitches are different versions of a buffer overflow exploit.  
They're just arbitrary code execution, they're managing to get the game to produce invalid powerup values which change jmp instructions to go places they shouldn't. No buffer overflowing as far as I'm aware.  
Tom Scott has so many awesome video  
What they do with these exploits is actually quite similar to how modern systems get hacked. You take advantage of something like a buffer overflow, use-after-free condition, or poorly validated input to corrupt the program state in a way that you control. In this case, I think they exploit a use-after-free bug, which itself exists due to a race condition. It works something like:  By hitting the block with precise angle and timing, you can spawn several Yoshis at once. Normally if a Yoshi is already active, any new ones will spawn as 1ups instead, but if they're spawned quickly enough, they don't recognize the others and will spawn as Yoshi. If Yoshi runs off a pit while holding an object in its mouth, that object's memory is marked as free. However if you have multiple Yoshis spawned, you can still manipulate the object afterward, because all Yoshis share a single global variable pointing to the object they're holding. (Normally there can only be one Yoshi, so no problem.) You can exploit this by getting another object to spawn in that memory, which Yoshi's "object in mouth" variable still points to. Then when Yoshi spits out the object, it changes some variables in that memory. If that object isn't designed to be eaten, this change can corrupt its state. The game program later looks at the object's state and refers to a table of addresses where each state's code is located. If the object is in some corrupted state, then it's going to look past the end of that table into some other memory and try to run code from whatever arbitrary address it finds. Since most 8 and 16-bit consoles don't have any sort of memory protection or exception handling, it will go on trying to interpret whatever that memory holds as CPU instructions. Usually this leads to the game crapping all over itself and freezing up, but if you can control that memory, you can put some valid instructions there, and make the program do whatever you want. In this case, the corrupted state leads the game to read instructions from a memory region that holds controller input, so by holding the correct buttons on the controllers, you can control that memory and insert a few instructions to make the program do what you want and/or return to normal operation. Seth chains a few of these exploits together to corrupt Mario's powerup state, so the program jumps into some arbitrary memory - and ultimately to memory he can control - when obtaining a powerup. He writes a small program into an otherwise unused memory region, then takes advantage of the fact that this game stores some program instructions in RAM (where they can be changed). Patching those instructions lets him redirect the game program to the one he wrote without having to jump through all these hoops every time. Now he's fully taken over the game program and has it running a Flappy Bird clone instead.  A lot of games have these kinds of exploits, but it takes very precise timing and inputs to trigger them (so the original programmers didn't fix them because they went unnoticed or weren't worth the effort), and it takes a lot of skill and luck to be able to actually take over the program after triggering such a bug, instead of just having it get stuck in a loop and trash everything. You might like to look up some of the Pokemon examples. Those don't require precise timing, so they're easier to follow.  
Fantastic explanation, thank you!   
They often did a lot of tricks and shortcuts for games on earlier hardware to try and extract as much power/juice/performance as possible. A lot of times, this results in holes in how things are handled, because of how 'hacky' they programmed the game. They sacrifice checks for and validation of code for performance.  
And in principle, a lot of the "hacks" are perfectly fine and safe by themselves, except for one little bug somewhere that exposes their seamy side and makes them a stepping stone for further exploitation.  
I think you might have just done the impossible found an IDE worse than emacs.  
Them's fightin' words son!  
Nothing worse than emacs... But opening vim by accident (I was learning Linux) was a mistake I'll never forget about, still makes me laugh.  
Q: How do you generate truly random strings? A: Open Vim for an undergrad and tell them to quit.  
I gave a project partner a similar experience when I caught him using nano during one of our group coding sessions. A quick "alias nano=vim" later fixed that.  
A quick alias and shell script can lead to fun like this: "git push=git push --force"  
I like "alias fuck=sudo !!"  
You're evil :p  
:wq  
You probably shouldn't be saving stuff you open by accident.  
I prefer :x  
Or ZZ  
:q!  
Vim is the Brokeback Mountain of text editors.  "I wish I knew how to quit you."  
Reset your PC mate. //edit - first time I used vi on a CLI only machine I literally switched to a different terminal and init 6  
Yep, if you don't know vim already, falling into that hole is a bitch to get out of.

I met you at PAX South and you mentioned an upcoming project that would blow my mind. I have to say that this exceeded all my expectations. Way to go.  
Can we consider jumping around in SNES Super Mario World a programming language now?  
More like an IDE   
He's coding in assembly. The method of input is non-standard, but assembly is the code. Raw assembly at that.  
Maybe I'm not understanding this correctly, but how did you know where to move Mario at a pin-point pixel accuracy with your naked eye? That sounds like a super human feat.  
A lot of practice. It turns out SMW is pretty low resolution.  
So since you had to eyeball the first 31 bytes, do you have all those locations memorized, or did you use pictures for reference?  
If you look at his notes (in the vid description) he has pictures with guides as to how to line it up for the first section.   
Super Nintendo uses 256x224 resolution.  On a 1080p display each SNES pixel is a 4x4 block.  Those are pretty big pixels.  
This is fascinating! What was your motivation for doing this?  
TASBot has done several exploits like this at GDQ events, and I thought it would be cool to see if it could be done by a human.  
So while the robots are beating us at Go, we are at least fighting back on Super Mario.  
Except he's teaching them to play this game too.  
I admire your dedication, thank-you for sharing this project.  
Does the black/grey blotch during flappy bird that appears on an actual SNES but not on emulators mean that you found an undocumented hardware bug?  
No, p4plus2 just wasn't thorough enough in his testing. It turns out it was actually the game trying to render Yoshi.  
Typical p4plus2  
What is this, amateur hour?  
This is literally one of the most impressive things I've ever seen..  
Can you find glitches in Node.js to inject mongodb code in the cloud?  
webscalewebscalewebscalewebscalewebscalewebscalewebscalewebscalewebscale  
 maximum recursion depth exceeded   
If only v8 implemented TCO!  
Does Super Mario World support sharding?  
Was the payload a little bit buggy?  Looks like flappy bird was resetting when you hadn't actually encountered a collision.  
I think that only happened on the first attempt, it does look like a bug.  
Alright Seth, you know what you have to do... exploit that bug to write the bytecode for yet another game into flappy-bird-inside-smw. We have to go deeper!   
What if he injected the code for SMW into the flapp-bird-inside-smw?  
You mean... Reset the game?   
You were getting a lot of donations and the like on your stream yesterday. How much of that is going to p4plus2 for developing and engineering the specific exploit you used?  
I actually agreed to split half the YouTube video revenue with him.  
That's awesome, I see a lot of people who work on similar things never get any credit (or any of the money) because they weren't the person on camera doing it.   
Hi Seth. I'll have to give a full watch later, but after a few minutes of clicking through I have a question.  Is what you're doing possible to execute in the original, untouched hardware? i.e. Whether tools assisted in reading memory etc or not, would the same effect be achieved if you perfectly mimicked the actions on the original hardware/cart?  
Yes, I used unmodded retail hardware.  
That's amazing.  Great job, man.  
This is great! Have you ever considered implementing a hex editor using this glitch? I'm sure you could cram a simple one into some less than 300 bytes of RAM and use it to bootstrap a larger piece of code without the tedium of the current approach. Say, up/down to increment LS nybble, left/right to increment MS nybble, shoulder pads to move pointer. Of course, the current approach is superior on the showmanship side of things.  
I think the flashy aspect of it all is some of the fun. If you watch the full stream, towards the end he noted he could have used an easier method, but that this one was the most interesting to watch and experience.   
There is something I don't get in the video. You wrote down a piece of code that is supposed to be executed between each frame.  Why doesn't the game crash because of unfinished code during the whole process?  
I wrote the first byte last. That is, I didn't overwrite the previous code's "return statement" until I was done with the rest of my bootloader code.  
Wait, does that mean all the code was written backwards? Or in some sort of sophisticated jumble?   
It was a jumble. I tried to organize it so I would have the smallest distance to move the P Switch each write.  
Did you write a program beforehand to reorder the instructions to optimize the movements for you or did you just write chunks of contiguous code in an order that looked good?  
That's insane. Must have taken a lot more planning than it seems, especially writing chunks at a time.   
Like a traveling salesman would.  
this was crazy! writing in 300 bytes manually..... that's quite a tedious task.   
I don't know what's going on but I am impressed  
How does one find a way to do the original injection? By staring at code? Accident? Someone else's accident?  
someone reads the code for the game.   
This is the nerdiest thing i have ever seen. Thank you!  
I have a Computer Science degree, a fondness for video games of all sorts, and grew up with NES and Super Mario Brothers.  Yet still, I look at this and wonder...BUT WHY? I mean, seriously.  You're a gifted programmer with skills that could be applied to all sorts of neat things.  Does this just bring you the kind of joy that an artist might get from creating something beautiful but otherwise useless?  
Yep.  
It might be an unintended consequence, but this type of neat exploitation is a very good illustration for "breaking out of the matrix/virtual world" concept as a potential risk for AGI containment.  Also amazingly fun to break things in this way, great enterainment.  
What is AGI Containment?  
AGI = artificial general intelligence  
https://youtu.be/dLRLYPiaAoA  
'AGI' stands for 'artificial general intelligence'. That is, versatile AI that adapts to more or less arbitrary situations like a human does, rather than being dedicated to a specific task like most existing AIs are. It's been conjectured for some time that an AI more intelligent than a human could be harmful to humans and even pose an existential risk (like in the Terminator movies). This has led to considerable speculation on how to 'confine' such an AI so that it can't reach outside the computer it's running on in order to harm us. However, it's also been conjectured that we should always expect a superhuman AI to find loopholes we never noticed, and escape from 'prisons' we consider to be 100% secure. This is known as the AI box problem.  
 AGI containment  What does this mean?  
artificial general intelligence, so what you think of as a true, well rounded ai. He's saying eventually the ai could find small exploits like in the video and use them in unpredictable ways to break out of it's purposed programming or "containment"  
Cool beans.  It is fun to watch, and amazing to consider.  Partially for the technical prowess being displayed, partially for the art and love for video games, and partially just because someone with your ability has the time, focus, and motivation to actually sit down (for months) and do this.  Neat all around.  
You do youtube full time and dont program for anyone else?  
Yes, he works only on Twitch/Youtube. He used to work at Microsoft but quit to do YT full time.  
 I mean, seriously. You're a gifted programmer with skills that could be applied to all sorts of neat things. Does this just bring you the kind of joy that an artist might get from creating something beautiful but otherwise useless?  As a stubborn cunt with the adult equivalent of oppositional defiant disorder, I can verify that doing something nobody has suggested you should do, feels extremely good, even if it's completely pointless. I once crunched a good 2-3 days just to write my own tool to tidy up and nicely display random pictures in organised folders on my computer, but if I'm getting paid to write code, I probably put in about 3 real hours of effort per day.  
 I once crunched a good 2-3 days just to write my own tool to tidy up and nicely display random pictures in organised folders on my computer, but if I'm getting paid to write code, I probably put in about 3 real hours of effort per day.  This isn't just called being a computer programmer? I think I lost my whole long weekend to working on a silly thermal printer project that I'll probably throw out half the code for when I get a new component in a week, but now that Monday's rolled around I still haven't really touched work.  
I once wrote a bootable brainfuck interpreter in assembly language, that boots any PC then runs brainfuck programs (actually slightly modified version of brainfuck that allows it to directly access registers and call interupts).  Debugging that was an exercise in patience;  I think it's the digital equivalent of building ships in bottles, or making things out of matchsticks.  
 with skills that could be applied to all sorts of neat things  In what way is this not neat? To quote the great Pastor in PoC||GTFO 11:2  And this is the crux of the matter, dear neighbors. We become jaded by so much garbage on TV, so much crap in the news, and so many attempts to straight-jacket the narrative of security research by the mistaken belief that it must involve security. But the very best security research doesn‚Äôt involve security! The very best research has no CVE, demands no patch, and has no direct relation to anything from your grandmother‚Äôs credit card number to your server‚Äôs shadow file. The very best research is that which teaches you something new about the mechanism by which a machine functions. It teaches you how to build something, how to break something, or how to take something apart, but most of all it teaches you how the hell that thing really works.   
I would say useless is to strong. If you made something special and show it around, chances are people view you as more valuable. Which is pretty important for getting jobs and just general acceptance.  
True true.  I know a guy who made a silly mobile app that would basically just play the CSI "Oh yeah" meme on demand, used as a rimshot for bad puns.  He demoed it for giggles during an interview at one of the top 3 large companies in the nation (top in terms of employer rating and employee satisfaction), and it probably played a role in helping him get the job.  
It's fun!  
Noob Question: Could this be done, given enough time and knowledge of glitches, on other, more complicated systems?  In other words, can one inject arbitrary asm code, in this fashion, into pc using standard peripheries, without having to use compiler?  
Yeah if you can find a suitable point of entry. Which for complex systems is rather difficult, see previous and current gen consoles. Heh, even TI calculators.  
[deleted]  
First the Mari/o then this.  This is really some amazing stuff.  Thanks for sharing it, I look forward to reading your notes.  
[deleted]  
Not at the moment, this has been my big project the last several months.  
What about hacking Flappy Bird so you can play SMW in it?  
Well this is one of the stupidest things I've seen all day but it's absolutely brilliant that's so much work well done Seth :)   
If you ever wanna have babies i'm here  
Seth, your shit is always super fucking neat  
You make some of the most amazing things, keep up the great work.   
I like how you're the first human to do this.  
Awesome job! I love seeing TASBot stuff at AGDQ for arbitrary code execution, but to think we've reached a point where it's possible by human input as well is pretty amazing.  
You do a lot of arbitrary code execution stuff, particularly with SMW. Since you can inject code into the game, could you theoretically inject code that could fix some of the various bugs that SMW has? Not that anybody would want to. I just wonder if you could. I also have a degree in Computer Science, and studied some x86 assembly in school. While I found the language a nightmare to work with (mostly considering the hoops I had to go through to do the work on a Vista machine), the capabilities are impressive. Especially once I learned most/all older cartridge games were written in assembly. Great work regardless. Can't wait to see this demonstrated at SGDQ2016  
Not really. Most of the game's code gets run from ROM without touching RAM.  
I didn't understand alot of that there dude, however I can appreciate how excellent it is/was! Well done.  
Inject the source code you say? :P Anyway amazing achievement, and thanks for the detailed explanation!  
In this case the source was assembly... So, yes, the source code was injected, which also happens to be the code executed.  Edit: As /u/vawksel pointed out below for those who weren't aware, assembly is just human readable machine code and translates one-to-one with the instructions executed.   
To be technical for clear understanding: Assembly is human readable source code which gets converted to machine code by an assembler. The machine code was injected, not the original assembly source code. Try this: https://defuse.ca/online-x86-assembler.htm#disassembly E.g. source code on x86 intel: mov ax, 42 The machine code output in base 16, or hexadecimal: 66B82A00 In this Mario "hack", someone wrote a Mario version of Flappy Bird in assembly for the SNES CPU, then used an assembler to convert it to machine code. Then the machine code, not the original assembly, was programmed into the game by using all those tricks. If he had inputted the assembly source code, then the game would also need an assembler to convert all those human readable strings into something the SNES CPU could execute. Technically, it might be possible to program in an entire assembler, so that assembly code could be injected afterwards to be executed, but boy would that take a while :-)  
That there is a one-to-one relationship doesn't mean that the unassembled source code is equivalent to the machine code. You can't just inject the source code and run it. That is, unless you injected an assembler before...  
*machine code. assembly is a language, just like c or java or python.  
Assembly get's translated virtually one to one. From a human readable form into machine code. So you can literally count the number of clock cycles something will take the CPU to perform by reading your assembly source code. This is nearly impossible in C code, Java or Python. Also, you can usually convert the machine code back into the original assembly (minus the comments left in the code). You really can't do this with C code and end up with anything that looks remotely like the original C code. With Java, you can get code that looks much more similar to the original Java. With Python, it doesn't make sense because python is usually interpretted and executed from the source code level itself. In higher level languages, such as C, the code you write is translated into many assembly instructions (or direct to machine code). The code is also usually optimized, so much so, that sometimes the machine code does something you didn't consider at the higher level in C. For example, int x = 10 * 2; could result in a bit-wise shift left operator instead of a multiply instruction because the shift left operator is faster for the CPU to execute and with careful consideration by the compiler could 100% of the time produce the same results. With assembly, this is never the case. If you write a multiply instruction, the CPU will always perform the multiply.  Java code, which looks somewhat similar to C code to an untrained eye, will get compiled into Java Byte Code. This is Virtual Machine Code, instead of Native Machine Code. It's for the Java Virtual Machine to interpret and execute on a CPU. This is so that the Java Byte Code can run on many different architectures, platforms, or CPU types, and as long as a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) exists for that platform, the Java Byte Code can be executed. For example, you can run the same Java Byte Code or Java Program on a PowerPC Mac with a JVM as an x86 based Windows PC with a JVM. This is impossible with both an assembler program written for a specific CPU type, or a C program's binary output compiled for a specific CPU or platform. Python in it's standard use case, is interpreted at the source code level. A python interpreter program will more or less read the source code you wrote, character by character, and execute the code as soon as something meaningful to it has been read. This results in the slow execution versus Assembler, C or Java. There are compilers for Python which will create native binaries for specific CPU types, but they are used less commonly as far as I know.  
First off, to be pedantic, assembly is not strictly 1-to-1 with respect to machine code; it's a surjection. Yes, in your college CS class you usually use languages that are more-or-less bijective, but there are many assemblers out there with macro support, in which case your source cannot be reconstructed from the emitted machine code. Secondly, you've missed the point. Assembly, C, Python, Java, and every other language with a spec is completely independent of implementation. If I show you a valid Python script, it doesn't matter who runs it, or in what environment, or whether it's compiled or not, as long as the runtime is implemented correctly. It will act exactly the same everywhere. This is the same with Java, and the same with C (assuming your program doesn't rely upon undefined behavior). It's also the same with asm. I could write some NASM and build an interpreter for it that correctly emulates the x86-64 environment, and it wouldn't have to be assembled (i.e. converted to machine code) at all.  Since assembly is just text, not executable instructions, SethBling didn't write assembly into SM3 memory, he wrote machine code. Another way of looking at this is that a C compiler, or the JVM JIT, or the Python interpreter, does not emit assembly (or is not required to, anyway, which is all that needs to be shown). It takes your source, processes it, and emits a binary (machine code).  
Technically that's true, though the major difference between regular languages and assembly is that assembly is directly translated to machine code (with the exception of labels I guess). You can go from machine code to assembly but you can't go from machine code to something higher level  
This is an impressive feat. Thanks for sharing.  
Awesome and impressive, Seth.. I always enjoy watching your videos (injections like this and your Minecraft vids.)   :D  
It seems I've been playing Super Mario World wrong this whole time, what a ruse!  
Witchcraft! Sorcerer!!  
i thought black face mario was pretty ballsy :p  
Is there a subreddit for this kind of stuff?  
/r/sethbling   
Literally just found out about your work two days ago (Didn't realize you worked on MarIO AND were part of the MindCrack server). You may be one of coolest people I've discovered online and I can't wait to see what else you do. Great work, man!  
/u/Sethbling ... Now that's a name I haven't heard in a while. Glad to see you're still around.  
I now realize that flappy bird may have tapped into how childhood memories of under water mario levels.   
Do you have any resources that explain how the payload was translated in to x coordinates?  
I don‚Äôt mind that it‚Äôs Microsoft. My problem is any wide reaching tech company that acquires GitHub is going to have conflicts of interest. That‚Äôs definitely true with Microsoft. It‚Äôs tough to resist the temptation that exploiting GitHub to benefit other parts of your company. That was definitely less of an issue with a stand alone GitHub.  
[deleted]  
VSTS competes with GH Enterprise.  I think they'd probably go the other way.  GH Enterprise users get migrated to VSTS.  Combine the backends.  Differentiate based on feature offering.  GH is for OSS, individuals and small teams that have simpler needs.  Leverage VSTS/Azure for an integrated CI/CD offering.  VSTS is for the medium to large companies that need a more sophisticated entitlements system, issue tracking and project management and the ability to do customizations.  Provide a simple migration path from GH to VSTS.  As a company grows, they have a clear and simple migration path for the Source Code, Issue Tracking and Project Management needs. As a someone who looked into GH Enterprise, the experience was pretty lackluster.  Their sales approach was basically "Take it or leave it, we don't care."  Which doesn't work if you work in a regulated industry and have to deal with things like SOX and BASEL II.    
I am willing to bet that they make VSTS more complex and leave GH as a simpler solution. And then allow "upgrading" your git to VSTS.  
Microsoft already allows migrating from GitHub to VSTS and back again.  I think as they were negotiating with GitHub to ensure this was always easy for customers to do they came to an impasse, specifically around Enterprise customers.  Buying GitHub would be an easy solution if that was the case.  
[deleted]  
First, I'm not a fan of this aquistion for privacy reasons. But I don't see GH Enterprise getting shuttered. They just paid $7.5 billion for it. I would expect the Git part of VSTS replaced with GitHub Enterprise. Using GitHub is what draws developers in and if they make the jump to VSTS include GitHub Enterprise I think it would increase adoption.  From the press release it sounds like Microsoft wants to integrate GH Enterprise with more Microsoft services than Github.com. I would expect them to leave GitHub.com alone for the foreseeable future. They realize what's at stake; their reputation and if they "Skype" it up then the developers that still trust MS will leave for something else and MS will loose all the good will they've worked for recently and GitHub.com will cease to exist.   
 I would expect the Git part of VSTS replaced with GitHub Enterprise  Why would they do that. What exactly does GitHub Enterprise provide that VSTS currently doesn't?  
I don‚Äôt understand the privacy argument. Microsoft hosts classified data for the US government (among others) and you‚Äôre worried about your tiny shops legacy code?  
 I would expect the Git part of VSTS replaced with GitHub Enterprise. Using GitHub is what draws developers in and if they make the jump to VSTS include GitHub Enterprise I think it would increase adoption.   As a VSTS and Azure development consultant this reads like you've never really looked at VSTS. The integration and tooling surrounding all of the aspects of development work much better together in VSTS. You use the same service to take your code from first checkin all the way to deploying straight to production. GitHub doesn't have that tooling.  It's very unlikely that MS is going to kill either product anytime soon, but I would be extremely surprised if MS killed VSTS in favor of GitHub Enterprise. Especially considering that GitHub Enterprise costs $250/user/year while VSTS costs $60/user/year for more features.   
MS can also offer Government clouds (Blackforest et. al.) via. Azure, which is essential if say, the US air force wanted to use GitHub.  
 hosting a FOSS project on GitHub is almost a given  I wouldn't count on that. There are already high-profile departures coming in. Not that I have a stake in this. If anything, I find the kind of monopolistic culture we'd been having lately depressing given the federated/distributed nature of both the Web and git, and look forward to see real project web sites again.  
 There are already high-profile departures coming in.  What are people migrating to?  
Git lab probably, I'd like some examples though.   
Gitlab https://monitor.gitlab.net/dashboard/db/github-importer?orgId=1  
Does anyone use bitbucket or is atlassian horrible too?  
 There are already high-profile departures coming in.  Such as? I am genuinely interested and kind of hopeful that a very high-profile departures would mean increased competition for GitHub.   
At the end of the day - cloud services are just someone else's computer.   You should not be putting anything very private there.  
Well of course. But these are open source projects. They obviously won't have any secret passwords on there.  
[deleted]  
 like Sourceforge once did  The difference being that a project using git can easily move to a different platform and retain history etc.  
[deleted]  
exactly. The point of this is to acquire customers, not lose them. Every big IT company on the market today (MSFT, GOOG, etc.) cares a whole lot more about having happy customer that reliably make them money than the secret to middle-out compression. They have enough R&D and product teams for that.  
Big companies get audited as well, to ensure they don‚Äôt. But the teenagers whining wouldn‚Äôt know about auditing, it‚Äôs a big company thing.   
[deleted]  
lol imagine the shitstorm if Oracle bought them somehow.  
[deleted]  
Oracle definitely hires competent engineers. Then they make them do shit work and then they lay them off whenever it's convenient for Larry Ellison.  I've worked with a number of ex-oracle people. They worked, they got paid well, they left for greener pastures.  Oracle isn't run by a cynical marketing department either. It's run by a sort of human-looking robot whose three laws are "enrich yourself, do whatever you want, fuck everyone else." Unfortunately it (Ellison) has been successful. They don't cynically market their product, they just casually bribe managers to approve using it.   
Was going under a possibility? I know they weren‚Äôt profitable but I assumed they had plenty of capital and we‚Äôre getting better revenue as time went on.  
[deleted]  
Honestly, Microsoft buying GitHub is probably the best chance at GitHub actually becoming open-source at some point.  
[deleted]  
MS has been the largest Github contributor for awhile  
Bear in mind, it could simply be a books / licensing / corporate acquisition, like Microsoft acquiring Mojang.  
 It‚Äôs tough to resist the temptation that exploiting GitHub to benefit other parts of your company.  Resist? That's the main reason they bought it. You think they wanted a company that's been in the red for years for its good business direction?  
Maybe you will be the first person on Reddit who can explain what nefarious thing is going to come of this because everyone saying something like what you just did can only cite ‚Äúfuck Microsoft‚Äù as a reason to dislike it.   
If I host a web shop selling books on AWS, isn‚Äôt there also a conflict of interest with Amazon? Oh wait, no. There isn‚Äôt. Because legal covered that shit already. Other example: Apple hosting Spotify on the App Store despite it competing with Apple Music. Once again, legal got you covered. Apple can‚Äôt do nasty shit without getting sued to shit.  
 Microsoft is all-in on open source. When it comes to our commitment to open source, judge us by the actions we have taken in the recent past, our actions today, and in the future.  Let's open source Windows guys <3  
#openthewindows  
Student: Can I open the Windows? Teacher: Yes. Student: pulls out laptop  
that student's name? satya nadella  
I could see them open sourcing the Windows kernel, and maybe some other small parts. I couldn't see them open sourcing the whole thing. The Windows distributions will certainly have lots of stuff they have licensed which MS would not be allowed to open source. I'd imagine it would be a legal nightmare to just review their existing code base due to how big it is.  
https://github.com/Zer0Mem0ry/ntoskrnl  
Doesn't sound like it's in a build-able state though :(  
Was it ever? /s  
Hey, they released the source code  for WinFile . So that's a start... *edit: fixed link   
They could probably do this and nobody would get it anyway. NT kernel is very likely to be among the most complicated and convoluted pieces of software to exist yet.  
I tried reading the Linux kernel once. It make no sense to me. I‚Äôve seen part of the Windows source while working for MS, and the experience was similar. If you‚Äôre not a kernel expert, it‚Äôs all gibberish C code. Microsoft can‚Äôt release Windows as OSS though, as it would be a massive issue due to intellectual property patents (software patents) Releasing patented code is a major hurdle for all FOSS software, and generally why legacy products aren‚Äôt released as open source.  
You can release patented code just fine, they are just restrictions on what people can do with it. Copyright on the other hand is more annoying.  
I dunno, after reading quite a bit of the leaks it seems rather decent code, probably much better than average closed source. It's definitively not as clean as BSD, but similar to Linux, although with obvious different styles. That said I have (and do) developed Windows drivers and have only barely touched Linux driver development, so my opinion may be biased.  
Why would Microsoft knowingly embarrass themselves?  
Wasn't there leaked sourcecode available from Vista? Afaik the code was rather ordinary  
Yeah. Windows 2000 source code was leaked as well. I think the most extraordinary things you will find are either:  Bugs that are intentionally left in place to ensure old software works that may depend on these bugs. Hard-coded workarounds for specific pieces of software.  Basically, legacy compatibility.  
I think it would be surprising if you didn't find these things.  
Follow The Old New Thing blog to find all kinds of examples regarding strange backwards compatibility tricks they needed to implement. "You can return your new Windows version, but you can't return old broken software X."  
If there is one thing MS is great at, it is binary compatibility. This is what you would expect lots of.  
[deleted]  
So, just like 99% of the code out there?  
There's leaked sourcecode from Windows 10: https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3012603/microsoft-falls-prey-to-windows-10-source-code-theft  
Naively I don't think they are "lying" but it seams absolutely paradoxical with their main proprietary products : Windows, Office... (Sorry if I didn't get the irony, I'm French)   
I think he is saying that their code is so bad it will be an embarrassment for us to see it  
That's what I thought afterwards, too late.   
The implication is that the Windows (NT) code is of low quality and filled with cruft. Having worked on the NT kernel in the past, he is not necessarily wrong. The code certainly tends to the pragmatic side.  
Is Linux code particularly better? (I have really no idea, but it is certainly a good point to promote open source)   
[deleted]  
The company where I work have a few open source initiatives and we prefer using open source tools, but the code base for our web based application is still proprietary as it obviously contains business secrets. I would view MS in the same way, they are still allowed to be open source enthusiasts.  
This. Having your "core" technologies/solutions proprietary isn't a bad thing and isn't impossible to work with OSS.  
Those same people also think Microsoft now magically has access to all the encrypted private repos on Github, and legally owns them.  That‚Äôs not how it works but it‚Äôs Microsoft, this is Reddit, common sense is second to sensationalism.   
[deleted]  
Visual Studio is hands down the best C/C++ development environment in existence.   
I myself do most of my development under WPF/C#, and I absolutely LOVE Visual Studio. I've used it for plenty of other languages, too, and I always find it to be very intuitive. I've also done my fair share of Android development under Eclipse and Android Studio, as well as iOS development in Xcode.   Visual Studio feels miles ahead of those. I wonder sometimes, though, if that's true, or if I've just been using Visual Studio so often and so long that everything else is foreign. Android Studio is a HUGE improvement over Eclipse, though, and probably where I'm second most comfortable.   Xcode is... well, I hate it. I only work in it when my job forces me to, it feels completely scatterbrained, and at the time I worked in it Objective-C was the only option, and I found the language to be "dense" for lack of a better word. Now we have Swift and the app I'm supporting is in Objective-C and I don't feel like porting it, so I just glare at it angrily while I work.   But again, some of this may just be bias because Visual Studio is what I know the best.  
Visual studio with a ReSharper license is developer candy. I don't think I can go back to the days I was coding Java in college without an IDE like that.  
Why are none of the people like you mad that github is closed source?  
I don't understand this obsession with open sourcing company's core technologies. Windows is Microsoft's core business (well now Azure is the focus). Would Amazon ever release open source their e-commerce platform? Would Google open source it's advertising platform? No, it doesn't make sense.   
 First, we will empower developers at every stage of the development lifecycle ‚Äì from ideation to collaboration to deployment to the cloud  OK, What does this mean ? GitHub + Azure somehow ?  
I'd imagine it'll be like VSTS.  Continuous Integration with a "Deploy to Azure" button (among many other Deployment workflows).  
Think of the deployment solutions they might cook up. Similar to heroku or something. Like you push to a branch to deploy code on an azure instance.   
That's one big merge conflict right there  
Force push.  
That got a chuckle out of me  
Ohh I can already see all those desperate developers trying to scratch off the Github sticker from their Macbook.  
I love the extreme contrast between reception on /r/programming and /r/linux  
The reception seems to be pretty much the same. About 62.5% "THIS IS THE OSS APOCALYPSE I'M MOVING MY ASS TO GITLAB", 25% "I can't wait this is awesome", 12.5% "Don't really know how I feel but also don't understand the apocalyptic overreaction".  
If i would do a startup, I'd love to sell it for  $7.5 billion in Microsoft stock.   (If it would only generate loss like github :)) // I don't think much is gonna happen to Github at least for a year. Don't think there is a reason to panic (yet)  
Count me in! Shit I‚Äôll take 1 billion   
I'll do it for $3.50  
god damn lochness monster!

Also new Github boss:  Once the acquisition closes later this year, GitHub will be led by CEO Nat Friedman, an open source veteran and founder of Xamarin, who will continue to report to Microsoft Cloud + AI Group Executive Vice President Scott Guthrie; GitHub CEO and Co-Founder Chris Wanstrath will be a technical fellow at Microsoft, also reporting to Scott.  Nat Friedman is one of the Ximian/Xamarin guys that used to work on Gnome and then on Mono. He has a ton of FOSS experience.  
Satya makes some solid choices.   
This is good for us. FOSS guys at Microsoft get more power. For people out of the loop, the Microsoft org chart.  
I work at Microsoft. I do not disagree with this chart. Satya is trying very hard to change Microsoft, and has been doing a good job but its not something done quickly. He also made Phil Spencer an Executive VP, making xbox/gaming its own division.   
 For people out of the loop, the Microsoft org chart.  It's true, it really is very accurate. Now excuse me I need to go on on my latest assassin missionnew feature.  
They're losing the talent war. Decisions like this, eliminating stack ranking, putting bash in Windows, and etc. help to remedy that quite a bit, I'd like to think. But there's still a long way to go.  
Unfortunately, under Satya, the company keeps becoming a less attractive place to work.  The pay isn‚Äôt competitive with other Seattle area employers, and they‚Äôre busily destroying their leafy, airy campus and replacing it with high-density open plan offices - squandering the one advantage they had in competing for employees.  The brain drain over the last few years to Amazon/Google/Facebook has been incredible. I wish Microsoft the best in the GitHub acquisition, but this is just the latest in a series of ‚Äúoverpay for a soon-to-be-declining asset‚Äù additions to the company...  
IO performance is terrible in that bash on windows. To the point that I gave up since trying to get anything done was nigh impossible in a reasonable amount of time.   
Interesting that Chris became a Technical Fellow; that's the highest IC position and not the PM/manager track.   
Highest non-manager rank is "Senior Technical Fellow". As far as I know, the only one at the company is Dave Cutler, the architect for both the NT kernel and the initial launch of Azure. It's really a deceptive title though. Many of the people with titles like "Distinguished Engineer" and "Technical Fellow" aren't ICs at all. Many of them have 300+ person orgs reporting to them.  
Isn‚Äôt mark russinovich also a senior technical fellow?  
Always got the feeling he didn't really want to be in charge of people, but just got stuck in it. IIRC he became CEO because Tom Preston-Werner resigned.  
 GitHub will retain its developer-first ethos  *sweaty-developer-dance*  
Sorry, but this is exactly the stuff you say no matter what.  As a company you might have already decided to tank the thing you bought absolutely into the ground.  It doesn't matter, you say this same bullshit.  It's a standard "Oh nothing's going to change", and you have the now child company say "Oh yes, as far as we know, nothing's changing."  I've seen this first hand at multiple places. I'm not saying it's duplicitous, I'm just saying anyone swayed by these words is naive.  Only the actions will tell.  
It‚Äôs likely they already calculated the resulting backlash into a percentage of users that are likely going to leave. Business these days is mad.  
Oh definitely.  And they have a budget for the lawsuits that will inevitably follow.  Someone did risk assessment on that. What lawsuits you might ask?  I have no idea, but I'm sure someone will come up with something.  
I hope one day people will realize that press releases aren't even worth the bandwidth they're uploaded on. Empty words, only time will tell what will happen with github  
I wish I could get educated answers on why this is good/bad without denial of potential issues or FUD.  
Well, so far the only info is from the MS marketing team:  MS purchased Github for 7.5 billion they plan to integrate github with the MS cloud platform they plan to expand the enterprise side of Github, while keeping the free hosting  The rest is speculation. Nobody knows whether this is good or bad. Given MS's track record, a lot of people dislike it.

Is there a right website?  
Clear conflict of interest here, much more so than most Microsoft buys which are not open source centred  
I wonder what will happen with https://github.com/atom/xray Personally, i don't care about Atom (i doubt MS will continue developing it), but xray looked promising. It would be nice if xray could be developed further as potential base for future versions of vs code.  
Is there any reason why you think they'd stop developing Atom? I mean sure it's a possibility but I can't understand the reasoning. It's not like VS Code is a paid solution. Continuing dvelopment of both (and maybe even having some cross compatibility regarding some "team" features" would only increase the marketshare of use.  
Why half ass two things when you can whole ass one thing? VS Code is already working on a lot of stuff that XRay is trying to solve. I think they're both built on Electron anyway. Just fold in the XRay Rust optimizations into VS Code and double down.  After using various *nix operating systems for the past 7 years, I'm consistently surprised by how much I enjoy developing in a full Windows environment these days. If they carry that good will they've been trying to build with developers throughout this acquisition, it should be well welcomed.

I sensed a great disturbance in the FOSS, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. - Anonymous Coward: Slashdot  
My biggest concern here is trying to answer this question: Will Microsoft consider this deal a success if Github users still prefer other cloud offerings to Azure? If the answer to this question is No, then what will they do to ensure this deal is a success?  
 Will Microsoft consider this deal a success if Github users still prefer other cloud offerings to Azure?  If they wanted to solve that problem they could pull support for their technology stack from competing cloud offerings, but I think they've realized now that by creating vendor lock-in to themselves they'll just deter more people from using their stack... which is why most of the components of their developer toolchain is no longer locked-in to Windows, for example.   If the answer to this question is No, then what will they do to ensure this deal is a success?  They're going to sell GitHub Enterprise to their huge base of enterprise customers using other solutions, including their own alternative solutions (TFS, VSTS, etc)  
The minute they integrate their awful MS account/registration system is the minute I move away from GH.  
Maybe you shouldn't wait until they make it painfully difficult to move away.  
I only use GH as a code repo. Moving away will simply be a case of uploading the code to another provider and pointing the remotes to the new URL.  
I haven't even though of that!  Sign in with your Microsoft account to add your GitHub repositories to OneDrive and automatically sync to your Windows 10 PC.

Welcome to bitbucket  
I read a blog post by Joey Hess last year where he explained moving away from GitHub due to their new ToS https://joeyh.name/blog/entry/what_I_would_ask_my_lawyers_about_the_new_Github_TOS/  
I'm just very uncomfortable with the idea of a single corporation owning what is the chief hub of open source coding. I hope they don't include stupid integrations like you have to have a windows live account to sign in etc. That being said it could help improve some of the paid/commercial offerings of GitHub such as classroom and Github for work.  
Why does everything on the internet have to be owned by Amazon, Google, or Microsoft? God damn.   
Now GitLab is a safer option. And since it is open source that adds more value to it. GitLab can fulfill the real no centralized idea of git  
Until they suddenly need funding for their servers and then get bought up by Google. Edit: Turns out Google gave them $20M in funding recently  
Or they lose everyone's files again...  
Until someone buys it. Soon everything will be condensed into the big 4 unless people self host.  
Gitlab can be self-hosted too. There's an open source community edition that you can install wherever you like, as long as it's a fairly beefy machine (with something like 4GB of RAM minimum).  
True, our college actually used that  
They state on their mission page their aim is for an IPO and not to be bought out.  
Note that GitLab developers coded private session tokens in the URL that never expire, so someone who monitors which URLs you visit could have stolen code from private repos and other things. https://www.incapsula.com/blog/blocking-session-hijacking-on-gitlab.html This has been fixed, but I don‚Äôt trust that GitLab developers know the basics of security.

Oh only $460k? Fuck that  
Sarcasm or not, if someone has a grasp of engineering and networking on the level of being able to architect a viable solution to something like this that is implementable, they should be making $460k a year. Like, you offer me 460k and ask me to move a mountain, Sure, I'll try to get it done but I'm not going to put all my efforts into it, I don't see the return to the amount of time spent on it to be worth it. 2 million is probably low balling it honestly.  
$2M absolutely is low-balling.  I'd imagine whoever patents whatever it is that replaces the current infrastructure is going to be worth that one hundred fold at least. *Patent probably doesn't apply here, but someone is going to make money off of this.  Maybe I'm just cynical, but the contest seems like an investment rather than altruism.  
If you have the aptitude and drive to do that kind of architecture work this initial prize would only be a small bonus to you and your team in the grand scheme of things. Software and network architect is one of the highest paid positions in the software industry and for good reason. That person can be more important than any admin including the CEO for the success of a software product.

There is already a bunch of technologies out there, meshnet, cjdns. They should try to support cjdns, it's promising.     
I think people need to understand that there is a huge gap between "turn on this service and run it over my existing ISP" and "here's a new distributed infrastructure that replaces ISPs". Mozilla and NSF are asking for the latter one, which is non-trivial.  I'm glad they are sponsoring a small prize like $2m for this, as testing and equipment purchases are probably going to eat up most of that. Most people ITT are upvoting the former, without understanding that piggybacking on existing ISPs doesn't free them from censorship, it just limits some invasive behaviors by ISPs.

 ...arbitrary standards body...  Like Microsoft, Apple, Google, or Mozilla? Seriously, any one of the four could bake support into browsers, and let the user's marketplace sort out the winners and losers. It's not always ideal, but it's certainly better than letting ideas rot on the vine while committees tilt at windmills.  
the thing is whatever Google chooses would be the winner. It is not necessarily an issue, but their interests might not be everyone's interests. W3C being independent have the advantage to be able (maybe) to make a better choice.  
 A total of $2 million in prize money is available for wireless solutions that get people online after disasters or that connect communities lacking reliable Internet access.   
ZeroNet doesn't needs a special browser. Just run the application and it starts ZeroNet in your favourite browser.   
 Now all we need is some arbitrary standards body we've given authority to, WC3 or something, to pick and choose which standards to promote, and we'll be there.  Hold on just a minute. The point of a decentralized web is that there WOULDNT be a third party to promote it. That's literally the core definition of decentralized. And therein lies the pproblem. Nobody to advocate except the people themselves. Ethereum or meshnet don't work unless EVERYBODY whose capable of doing so does. That's insanely difficult to do, and the reason a 2mil bounty is up.  
I mean, you're not going to get ubiquity without the average person (who doesn't anything about computers and won't do any work to make them work) adopting it, and you're not going to get them to adopt it as an alternative to something that works and is already in place.  You don't need standards to make it exist, you need standards to make people adhere to it. It doesn't help anyone if it's not a consumer good.    
There's also blockstack by computer scientists from Princeton that I've come across on futurology.  
Ironic. Decentralization only available to the nation that everything is centered around..   
 Ironic    They could decentralize the Internet, but not themselves.

That would never work without a compression algorithm with a Weissmann Score of at least 4.3.

Once we can make a fusion reactor small enough to fit into our phone. But before that I guess we need to get a fusion reactor working. Or possibly create a wormhole with one exit at your phones charging port and the other at the charger itself. That one is doable now if you're really lucky  
We can create a mini verse with flooblecranks  
Was...that a joke about quantum tunneling?  
Nah, no fusion reactor needed. Just need to sap energy from the human body. Solve two birds with one stone: Obesity and Phone power.   
Yeah, the whole phones thing is so silly, due to battery and data usage. Meanwhile we basically all have desktops and laptops plugged into a wall 99% of the time, on 24/7, and on a higher speed more reliable connection.  
I don't think his plan used data. Like the phones become the servers so when you get enough people to join the new internet it just pings off of others wifi.

[deleted]  
How? I didn't seem to understand that part   
That's a bit surreal since one of the underpinnings of the Internet and the way it was designed was to be decentralized. Interestingly, because of the era of when all this started to take form, the main motivation for a decentralized Internet was driven by the fear of a nuclear strike knocking off the servers. If the network is designed to move packets from node to node dynamically so that it would automatically route around destroyed sections, then it becomes impossible to shut it down other than destroying most of the country. I've read the article and the motivation behind this initiative and I'm still at a loss about what they think that can come out of this project that's fundamentally different from the way the Internet already works today.  
It sounds like they're talking about peer-to-peer grid networks, i.e. getting rid of ISPs.  
How do you cross the oceans in a peer-to-peer grid network?  Like in silicon valley, the idea is to use smartphones as nodes, but what about in poorly populated areas where the distance between nodes is large, and what about the oceans?  Who controls the node that connects to the transpacific/transatlantic cable and who owns the cable?  
The cable should be owned and regulated like the pipes that bring water to your house and we should only be charged enough to cover workers, power, maintenance, and upgrading the network. No profits, no executives making millions per year, no lobbying billions per year, etc.  
tl;dr - The pipes should be owned by the public, regulated like a utility, and not owned by private corporations. It's too bad the government didn't extend its expansion efforts from highways to copper/fiber after they built the internet.  
[deleted]  
Are you expecting a new answer? It will be necessary to at least break even on the cost of operating a peer which can span poorly-connected sections of the network. Vehicles, cables, terrestrial radio terminals, aircraft & balloons, satellites... the physical infrastructure is only the second half of the problem. The first half is designing the economy (or perhaps game theory?) of a decentralized (!) network which:  people will want to use from day one and on, while also making peers want to handle each other's traffic, and both communicating the need for - and compensating - potential network improvements according to their value   
Maybe a flock of low orbit sats ? musk did speak about something like this. Anybody managed to make a fully solar powered drone ?  
A large, light glider with solar panel wings and a small propeller would probably work.  
you pay a small amount of a crypto coin to move data, and for each leg. You pay more to prioritize your data more.  People who provide and hook up infrastructure can charge crypt as they choose, although the system chooses the cheapest and best route.   Cables will be built when it's worth it to build cables because people will pay for it.  This is economics 2.0 type stuff and it's going to happen in a big way. If I build a laser link across a city that skips a lot of junk in between, I can sell that.  If I have an LTE repeater that is providing cell service for people, they can pay a little bit of crypt to use that.  This will enable phone plans that cost dollars per month instead of hundreds, depending on usage.  This model will drive data price down to cost. Decentralized, end to end encrypted, and cheap.  These systems ARE possible and they are the telecoms and governments worst nightmare.  
Does this mean every node would need to maintain its own routing table?   
Sort of.  It looks like they want to do away with centralized authorities.  Their website makes it hard to understand what they're wanting, because of things like  Chinese, Spanish, Arabic and Portuguese speaking internet users make up 37.5% of the total online population, but only 11% of the Web is in their language.  So...what needs to be done to remedy that, exactly?  
People who speak those languages need to become content providers and programmers.  
[deleted]  
Someone needs to maintain the cables/wireless connection points to enable the p2p connections. So we'd eventually choose a certain group of people to do so, then it might eventually become privatized again and then we're back where we started.   
The need for this becomes less in presence of a mesh based internet. This would be really high latency compared to the backbone, but as long as you could get the data eventually it would be worth it. Then, only those that needed low latency access would need to deal with isps  
Rip all gamers   
But what about today's IP stack prevents that?  We already have multiple P2P ways of sharing information.  And we've already discovered that centralising data is a good thing because it allows us to focus infrastructure improvements and it's beneficial from a security perspective, in having 'trusted authorities'*. I also don't get the Silicon Valley meme of using phones.  Like sure, but you're just replacing ISPs with wireless carriers.  Fundamentally it isn't any different.  If the idea is a mesh of a low-range radios, the latency is going to be shit anyways and a single node can break a network with poor routing decisions. * whether you can actually trust them or not is a different problem  
[deleted]  
Well, I think they're looking for someone to solve all those problems you just listed.  
Mozilla watched Silicon Valley  
Silicon Valley watched 20 years of academic work.  
20 years of academic work watched...the previous decades of academic work. i tried.  
Slightly unrelated but one pet peeve of mine is when people assume entrepreneurs came up with technological breakthroughs when oftentimes they actually come from universities, many times with public funding.  
More than likely some of the developers there are aware of the Skype's beginnings, BitTorrent and/or Coral and realized that they were a better way.  
The internet is decentralized at the level of major Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs, and other large institutional users who can afford to run their own AS (autonomous system). If you can afford the hardware and IT resources to run an AS, and participate in BGP peering, then you can be peered with multiple different providers over multiple physical lines, and if one goes down, the packets will be routed over a different network and still reach you. So the internet is decentralized and robust enough for large ISPs, universities, the military, Google, big data centers, and so on to remain online despite outages. For the end user, there's generally a reliance on a single, centralized ISP over a single line. If that ISP goes down, or that line is cut, you lose access. Even if you potentially have access to more than one ISP (DSL and cable say, or your landline and mobile connections), your house is not an AS, so you can't have the same IP address space routed via both connections. If one goes down, and you reconnect with the other, you'll have new IP addresses, which means that if you were running any servers at home, you'll have to update your DNS and people won't be able to access it until that DNS propagation occurs. Furthermore, many people in the US don't have access to even one broadband ISP. There are a lot of people living in rural areas in the US, where the only options may be dialup or satellite. So this initiative seems to be about ways to work around those issues; provide more robust and reliable access for home users in circumstances in which their only provider may be out, or in which they don't have access to wired broadband providers in the first place, and the capital costs of laying out a new FTTH network may be excessive.  
 Even if you potentially have access to more than one ISP (DSL and cable say, or your landline and mobile connections), your house is not an AS, so you can't have the same IP address space routed via both connections. If one goes down, and you reconnect with the other, you'll have new IP addresses, which means that if you were running any servers at home, you'll have to update your DNS and people won't be able to access it until that DNS propagation occurs.  Mobile IP solves this.  It does have some overhead, but surely the overhead is less than forcing every single end-user to run their own AS!  
I'm not suggesting ever single end-user run their own AS. Just that the current decentralized design of the internet exists for large institutions, but there's a lot around the edges that still has a lot of centralization.  
The actual name of the project is "Wireless Innovation for a Networked Society (WINS) Challenges". I'm not sure why they're talking about "decentralization" in that article. It's meant to give Internet access to people in the US, which apparently not everybody has.  We are seeking solutions to connect the unconnected. The Wireless Innovation for a Networked Society (WINS) Challenges, run by Mozilla and sponsored by the National Science Foundation, seek practical, new wireless solutions that will help connect people to the Internet in challenging circumstances: after a disaster or in areas without sufficient connectivity. We‚Äôre seeking wireless technology innovations that will make the Internet more accessible, resilient, and healthier.  This has nothing to do with TCP/IP or routing:  Here‚Äôs an example: A backpack containing a hard drive computer, battery and Wi-Fi router. The router provides access, via a Wi-Fi network, to resources on the hard drive like maps and messaging applications.   
 Wireless Innovation for a Networked Society (WINS) Challenges  Should've named it WINSocC  
The Internet was designed to be decentralised, but it isn't. It isn't viable to run cables between every single node in the network, so we centralise the cables into trunks. It isn't viable to have one worldwide trunk, so we segment the trunks into different ISPs. Building undersea cables is really expensive, though, so we're only gonna do a few of them. Making all this hardware work securely is impossible, so we build a bunch of centralised certificate authorities to tell us who to trust. Making routing work is really hard, so we centralise the configuration of that, and now it's easy for state actors to block access to particular nodes - so easy it has happened accidentally on many occasions.  The Internet is really quite centralised. There's single figures of root DNS server, vast swathes of the world which only get one ISP, our entire security model is based on centralisation, and global communications are extremely centralised. I can almost guarantee that my message got to you by going over a specific cable, because there's very few routes between the UK and the US which have the bandwidth to actually satisfy demand.  
[deleted]  
eh, that tool is interesting but very limited.  It's basically doing an IP sweep really fast.  That can give you decent info on a specific UDP service you want to scan for I guess, but those are far more rare than TCP services.   
That's a common misconception. The internet appeared by interconnecting the mainframes at several universities. It was a project with military connections, but it has nothing to do with surviving nuclear strikes.  
As far as I understand, the the topology of the internet is resilient to random nodes going down, but is not resilient against a small number of targeted attacks on the few super connected nodes, which would severely disrupt the internet.  
I think the term they meant to use was "a new Uncentralizable web". Any effort spent on decentralizing this web will only be immediately undone by the government and authorities in power now who want to centralize it.  What we need is a web that has builtin a little piranha that bites off the fingers of anyone who even begins to attempt to centralize it, leaving little bloody stump, as a warning to others who like to think that they are God and that they own the internet and the right to discriminate and charge people based on what they think and what they do.    
Some systems of decentralization reward those who serve data, in some manner; this could be modified to produce diminishing and eventually negative returns.  
I don't think they're trying to protect it from government conspiracy theories.  That's not the point of this.  
This is a very interesting project trying to solve the same centralized web problems.  https://ipfs.io/  
That's exactly what I was thinking... It seems like there is already at least one solution out there. I've used ipfs net, and it worked very well for me.  
So does it work without an ISP?   
That was my first thought, reading the top comments. IPFS, TOR, they are all good. If your infrastructure is intact. But when an earthquake destroys your ISPs network, any protocol on top of the regular internet is non functional.  
Web, not Internet.  
IPFS is doing something completely different though. It still relies on established and centralised ISPs. The article on OP is about connectivity to the net not on what/how to do once you are already connected.  
Can someone ELI5 what they mean by decentralize?  
Right now if you want to load Reddit and its data, its hosted on their servers. This would get rid of servers and everything would be hosted on everyone's devices by storing little chunks of data. So if you wanted to load Reddit it would come from multiple devices all over the internet rather than one centralized server.  
Is that good or bad?  
Both. Could in theory provide faster more stable internet. For example, reddit getting overloaded and shutting down less often or giving smaller sites "hug of death". Also good if you're worried about big government meddling with the web. It would be harder to control and monitor data. Bad because everyone needs to "share" to make it effective. So if your devices are serving up data for everyone else, you better hope you don't have a datacap. Or youll be paying for other people's browsing. Or your phone battery draining while it shares it's chunks of data. These are very simple examples and just scratch the surface. But I think its important to note for a decentealized system to work, it would require a lot of cooperation between ISPs changing and individual people sharing. Neither of which has a history of going well.  
Come to think of it how would a decentralized internet like the ones proposed even deal with sending data to a server for everyone to see? Like making a post on Reddit. Making a post would consume a HUGE amount of bandwidth as it basically spreads through all nodes that host Reddit data.   
Depends on how you see it. If you are law enforcement trying to shut down a site or invoke some kind of censorship, then bad. If you are someone who is a privacy advocate, then good. There are other technical pros and cons as well. Speed should be improved, but you will probably lose a small amount of space on your phone and your data plan will suffer more. That also means that Google won't have your data stored on Google Drive because its broken up into pieces and stored on multiple other devices. I'm talking on a packet level, not one file is stored on Bob's phone with another on Jane's. Its smaller than that.   
Interesting that Mozilla is offering up 2 million for something worth billions.   
 billions  it's not worth billions to people/governments with money...  
It's actually probably worth billions for them to prevent it.  
Not really, ideas like this aren't so much secret sauce.  Generally, the idea will come along very early, out of a government research branch or academia, and be implemented piecemeal, over time.  This is basically a research grant.  
Yeah except then they own whatever it is that you come up with.   
IP, TCP, HTTP, hypertext, the web, REST--all of these came out of academia and all are royalty-free. [Some were initiated and paid for by the DoD, but were created by academics working at universities.] I doubt any of these guys had trouble finding lucrative jobs afterwards. If you mean that Mozilla will own it, I'm under the impression that it will follow a normal NSF trajectory.  
Richard Hendricks doesn't get out of bed in the morning for a dime less than $25 million!  
If I can architect a plan, I'll just ask Gavin Belsen for the patent and I'll be a rich as fuck. Then I'll go to Mozilla and burn $2 million in front of their headquarters.  
I think the root of it all is hardware infrastructure.  A well functioning decentralized internet is only possible if there is great abundance of high bandwidth servers. Kind of like internet back bones of today, only with large amount of redundancy. That's only possible if governments decide to use tax dollars to fund construction of such networks for benefit of all Even then, you'd need some regulatory agencies to make sure bad actors don't simply flood the network with bad data to deny service to others.  
I agree that the key is the network hardware itself. Possibly when wireless becomes both directed, not broadcast, and the bandwidth is high enough, you can use all connected devices in a mesh network with some onion routing on top.  
[deleted]  
I think what they are getting at is the issues of interference and scheduling in wireless communications. E.g. If I have 1000 machines in a datacenter, I can connect them up with some switches and ethernet and they can use close to link speed constantly. Broadcast wireless devices don't really work this way. When one is transmitting, others can't really transmit at the same frequency. So 1000 devices in the same room will be communicating at 1/1000 link speed on average by taking turns on one frequency. While you can just buy more cables and switches, you eventually can't just add more frequencies (there is limited spectrum available for public use and the rest is expensive). Directed transmission could potentially help by having multiple nearby devices use the same frequency at the same time without interfering. I guess the idea is like having a lot of point to point links that dynamically point at each other and schedule to not use the same frequencies as overlapping links.  
Dynamically directed point to point links just doesn't really sound feasible is all.  Are you going to put a bunch of transmitters on gimbals inside your AP?  Same issue on the device side of things..  
I mean access points that talk to each device by having directed beams to each client (and each client having a directed bran back). I don't know how access points are defined by broadcasting traffic either? Other than broadcasting it's location, what data does it send that are interesting for all clients?  
There would be no way to design a "directed" internet connection. You would have to have a line of sight to the broadcasting tower at all times like a TV antenna, and even then it would be pointless because cell towers already broadcast better than TV towers. As for "one broadcast per client"- again having multiple people connect to the same tower or access point doesn't change anything depending on where the individual clients are. I guess if you build more cell phone towers you can have more bandwidth. But there's no way we're ever going to have one access point per connected device.  
 and 41% on Tribal lands  I really appreciate that they mentioned this.   
I always get so confused on this kind of stuff. Isn't it the tribal governments responsibility to make a contract with an ISP or make their own municipal service like every other small government? I don't understand what "sovereign nation" means anymore. Sometimes they are their own government and sometimes they are not. That doesn't seem very sovereign.  
Cdjns (decentralized components for letting anybody become an ISP, squats on a whole range of ipv6 addresses, all communication is encrypted after an initial handshake), this along with mesh networking is super promising, I think they should be getting the 2MM bittorrent and the biggest DHT (decentralized hashtable) implementation running IPFS - another attempt at decentralized file storage, these guys are building a while p2p technology stack for the same purposes ethereum - decentralized computing through blockchain technology ... there are a ton of people trying to do this

$2 million for a plan to decentralize a decentralized web?   
Middle out compression. Pay me.  
Ins't there already a plan? Something on p2p or blockchain if I remember correctly.  
Exactly. I'm surprised I haven't seen Ethereum mentioned in the comments yet.   
The ETH network would be a far cry from meeting the actual demands of the internet.  Maybe you could design a dapp for it, but at that point just do something other than ETH.  
Someone call Richard Hendriks  
You can't ever decentralize if everyone is using DNS and TCP/IP and the standard broadband providers. You'd need something like satellite or long range radio (like HAM) to head up the chain. Those would then need to do something like give a radio channel and public key to talk to the current head DNS resolver. And those satellites/radio stations would still need to be owned and operated by a non-partial 3rd party. The governments would all be interested in infiltrating them. But once that's in place, you could treat all the internet servers at big torrent servers and break up websites into multiple parts that are all signed with a key from the publisher. The problem here is that how do you get the backend parts working and decentralized? Maybe you come up with some architecture like bit torrent where the backend code is signed and distributed and each seeder machine runs some of the code? But then you have to combine the results. It would be easy enough with a distributed VM that was made for this kind of thing. But it would probably involve a new web architecture that allows developers to proportion the backend code into parts. But I still don't know how you'd protect against fake servers changing the interpretation of code to fuck with the results. Maybe it's like a thing where many, many machines run the code and the ones with the inconsistent results are thrown away? Maybe each machine that runs the code signs the results with it's own key and popular machines with well-known signatures are considered better? I'm drinking and throwing ideas out there....  
I don't understand this challenge, does such solution exist already with the TOR project or ipfs ? edit: Why I'm getting downvoted ? it's a legit question. edit2: And even solution for the least developed countries or during disaster was made. A thing that I got in mind was a paper created by a team from INSA Lyon where the basic idea was to create a network using phone as a node.

Someone needs to introduce these guys to Ethereum... Decentralized global computing   
There are already projects underway for the decentralized web. Is it not similar to the maidsafe network  and the zeronet?  
move it one inch to the left. I'll take my payment in gum now.  
It would be better for them to invest into their browser which has become unusable crap recently.   
I hear Ivanka's good at architecting, anybody ask her?  
At the core of this problem is two very difficult problems. One is physical and one is algorithm based. First, how do we create a physical P2P network that allows for networks to remain connected over long distance, has many redundant paths to prevent subgraph splits, and is consumer owned infrastructure rather than corporate owned. Second, a shortest path algorithm is needed where all devices are not required to store the entire network, but can efficiently identify the absolute shortest path to compensate for the reduction in speed that occurs as a wave travels a long distance.  
I wonder if anyone tried to win by submitting the spec for usenet. Also... now I wonder if part of the rise of reddit's popularity is that ISPs helped kill off usenet. http://reasonradionetwork.com/20080618/government-forces-major-isps-to-begin-killing-off-usenet

Ohh-ah-ah!  
I only started watching the show a couple weeks ago and I'm glad I did!   
Are you available for contact through the site or in general?  
Yes, I'll be offering live office hour sessions so you can hangout and chat with me/ask questions about the code. I'll send out an announcement about the next session soon.  
Going to give this a try!  I'm pushing 40 and have zero coding knowledge, but I need a new direction in life.  Thanks so much for doing this!  
Kudos to you for taking a shot at coding. I think you'll love it. Message me if you have any questions along the way. I'm here to help.  
Hey, really, thank you. This is the first course I've actually started after many months of sloth. I can already tell you're a great friend & instructor.  
:) Haha, hope you like it! Feel free to message me if you have any questions along the way. I'm here to help.  
The true brofessor bows down  
Can I visit your office hours?  
Yes. I'll send out an announcement for the next office hours where we can meet and discuss your progress or anything else you want to chat about!  
Like dogs and stuff?   
Not sure if you will see this. Turn 40 in six months and been doing web development full-time for the past 2 1/2 years. Worked as a glazer before but started building websites before my son was before 12 years ago (basic family website). Started with WordPress and moved in from there. Learned everything I know from online classes like this. I never thought I would be in the position I am now. If you have any questions about getting started please shoot me a PM.  
That's encouraging.  I'm 41 and just getting started.  I definitely feel too old,  but I'm determined to have a new career.   
There's no such thing as too old when it comes to coding. Technologies are changing all the time, so learning the current technologies now will put you in a more current position than a lot of people your age who've been working in the industry for a couple decades. Experience is gained quickly on the job, and experience both draws upon and expands upon your knowledge in the technologies.  
You're encouraging me!  
I'm a little older than you guys and have been in IT and programming 20 years or so..I'm actually glad to see some older people getting into it late in life.  I don't want it to be just me and 20 somethings.  (lots of people drop out of coding after some point, but not me, too many cool things to learn..)  
Never too old.   
Don't, I'm 46!  
I'm watching Christmas Vacation right now.   
Yep, same here. 42 started a webdev course on udacity 2 months ago, putting in an hour or so every day and reading/learning whenever I can. Going to a hack night this Thursday in the Baltimore area. After 15 years in healthcare I'm done. Want to learn and build things and be on a team. Spent too much time in college and graduate school, so psyched that this stuff can be learned online for practically free.  
it's a lot of hard work but it eventually pays off, Biglee.   
I'm in the same boat.  I'll be 40 in about a month.  I love my current job and will never give it up, but am excited about learning new things.    
This is the best thing that happened to me today. Thank you very much for this course. I wish you all the best!  
^  
This is your Udemy course that sells for 195 Canadian pesos, right? ($15 during the Black Friday sale.)  You're doing Zeus's work. Words cannot express my gratitude. Are you sure I won't see the message "Want to unlock this project? Subscribe to Upskill Pro" eventually?  
This is a different course from anything I've published. I re-recorded a new course completely from scratch here. And yes, free means free forever.  
You are the hero we need but not deserve  
Just wanted to chime in and say thanks heaps for publishing this mate. You are indeed a god. I've been struggling to to learn C# for the last 9 months from text books and its just not been clicking. I really like your style of presenting and I am gonna give this a shot! *EDIT, is there any chance you might be able to add an option to "Set default video quality"? I live in Aus-Internet Failure-tralia and the 540p stream is good enough for me but it's a only very slightly tinyly annoying to manually change the quality setting each time I load a vid.  
Please keep a donate button, as I've seen too many websites go from free forever to donate now! To pay to play...  If the donate button is there from the start, people can keep the site running no matter what without too much advertising the donate button or going directly to subscription fees or any other fees. It also makes it so that people who love this could get more content by donating if you have a full job or are alone in this. I'd hate to see this one day become "We need 24.59 dollars a month to keep this site running. DONATE NOW!"

Can I still do this course if I don't have a credit card available to set up a Cloud9 account?  
Yes, send an email to support@upskillcourses.com and we'll set you up with a free Cloud9 account.

You can set everything up on your own pc. There's no need to use it at all, it just makes things easier.  
It's just an IDE that makes some things a little simpler. You can use most IDE's or text editors. Though, I used Cloud9 for a Rails tutorial I did, and nothing bad happened. I understand that it's pretty reputable.  
[deleted]   What is this?   
Harvard's CS50 used cloud9.  
Legit question: why should I use your course over something like The Odin Project or Free Code Camp?  Obviously youll be a little biased as you built this whole course, but curious if there is a reason to choose one over the other based on some fundamental difference.   
I love both of those projects and think they're doing wonderful things. I think one of the main differences is that this course is dense in rich media format (i.e. video-based lessons). To be able to hear an instructor (me) describe concepts in multiple ways, while sharing my screen with a student (you) makes learning to code very efficient and allows you to understand the key concepts from multiple angles. That said, the best part of learning online is that you can use many resources, so I encourage students to use any quality resources they can find.  
How come you're giving this free? Not that it's a bad thing or anything I just want to know your thought process  
If he's been on a programmer's salary for 30,000 students' worth of courses, perhaps he's simply got enough. Some people see value in a world of sharing, and such people have my respect! Thanks, /u/robeendey.   
[deleted]  
As an auditory learner, being able to hear someone speak about something is really important to me being able to digest and internalize it. Thanks for doing this,   
I've already started The Odin Project, but have signed up for your course. I'll definitely be giving it a try and see how I like it. I'm sure a lot of courses will be personal preference, but the fact is you're still giving away a great set of resources for free.  You're doing gods work. Thanks!  
This is awesome! You're doing humanity a great service!  
I second this!   
I third this!  
I am the second person to third this!  
Wow. Thanks for this man! I will start it asap and let you know how it goes.  
Sweet! Pumped to hear your feedback and happy to help out where I can.  
[deleted]  
It goes from beginner to advanced. No previous experience is required. Try it, it's free!  
Wow this is amazing, thanks so much. I just got retrenched and I'm looking for new skills, this will do nicely  
I'm sorry to hear. Best of luck to you internet stranger   
"how to code" this is laser focused on web development, not general computer science. if you want a complete picture of general comp sci. go to college for it, and pay money to do so. that said, I can probably learn some things from this so thanks.  
Just got out of the military, and I've been looking into programs. How long would this program take on average?  
I am a comp sci major and I have been studying java for the past 3 semesters and have absolutely no idea what I am doing. (Either because i am not interested/motivated/ or i don't know why) I am VERY interested in this course however, I have one quick question: Would this course help me in my future with learning java and C etc for school and some type of development? Sorry in advance for the possible ignorance in my comment :(  
I've had a lot of comp sci majors take my courses and say that it helped them. Think of this course as a practical guide to real-world web development (i.e. things you'd be tasked to do at a job). While learning data structures and algorithms is important, this course helps to fill in the gaps by applying those concepts directly to real-world projects.  
thank you very much for your reply! I have trouble focusing in class as all i see is code yet i have no idea what its actually doing. It seems like this course will show me directly that coding is actually creating something rather than memorizing how data structures work without knowing why and for what. Thank you very much for the free resource.  Should I make an account or how would I go about using it properly. I hope you are making some sort of return off of this being free as you are helping so many people!  
Awesome. Yea, just make a free account and the course is yours forever.  
Any recommendation on how many videos to go through in 1 day/sitting? So that the knowledge is retained etc. I assume trying go through as much as possible within say 12 hours is a bad idea  
for a deeper understanding I'd say cs50 would help

I am returning to school for an IT degree in Health Informatics.  It looks like they will have me study C#/SQL/MS Visual Studio.  I glanced at the course material and wonder if there is value for me to consume the content even if the syntax is not exact?  Or would it be better to to stay away to avoid confusion in my little brain? As others have mentioned - thank you for sharing!  I won't be taking my classes for another year but I am trying to get ahead of the curve by studying free content now so I can might hit the ground running.  
I'd say go for it and give this course a shot. Since it looks like you'll be writing program scripts (C#) in conjunction with a database (SQL), you'll probably benefit from this course. Many language concepts are transferable to other languages.  
I signed up for your website/bootcamp when you posted a thread a few weeks ago. I got the first month for free but then $25/month afterward. Has that changed? Will I not be charged anymore. Sorry for my ignorance but this confused me a bit.  
Well is not really free :)  
So like a lot of people probably, I've wondered how much I need to learn before I can get paid to code.  If I master everything here, would I be ready to apply for a job and would I get fired instantly lol.  
I think you would be ready to take those projects on, yes. Though getting a job really would depend on what the employer is looking for. There is always an option to freelance until you feel comfortable enough on your own to apply for a job.    
How do you freelance? I work as an application developer...not sure how to get started freelancing  
You can go to this website, sign up for free (and yes, there is a paid account option, which has more options, but you don't need to have it necessarily), and start looking for projects that you are interested in.   
Maybe it's just me but I have a bad experience with those kind of websites - someone else around the world will undercut you for shtty code that the consumer won't realize it's shtty until later on  
This is great. I wish there was subtitles to the videos because I learn programming at work and there's no headphones/speakers allowed.  
Buy a single ear bluetooth hands free earbud 10 bucks or less from ebay. Super stealthy. Just say its a hearing aid  
Some people are weirdly embarrassed by hearing aids.  
I imagine they are just self conscious about it. I mean some people are still embarrassed by glasses  
I'm confused.  I think a few months ago, the only offering on upskill was the essential full stack web development course, I think I picked it up on a discount from slashdot.  http://upskillcourses.com/courses lists 3 courses, so which of the ones are you now offering for free?   The entry for the bootcamp seems to be an overview of the course material present in the "essential web dev" course, so what is going on here?  Thank you. edit: on second thought, how is this different than your offering on codermanual?  
Seems like every month or so this guy re-markets himself. Now that this post was successfully popular, the next post will be "I taught 50,000 students how to code".   
So what? He's helping more people than your complaining ass is  
I don't know what to say, Thanks a lot Roby :)

Thats awesome! Thank you for making it free

The real LPT is always in the comments  
exactly my thought when I first saw this post.  
I didn't know about this and I went into an hour-long rabbit hole. Thanks man   
Thank you. I am going to do this. This is the time that I'm going to follow through and finally learn.   
Not that I don't completely trust you, Mr. Internet Man, but is there a version of this course that I can download in full to run on my home server? I do actually trust you, but it would be cool to have an archived version.  
Website looks like you are trying to sell it   
Is there a way we can donate (even if it's a dollar or two) to help you out with this?  I glanced quickly at the page and didn't see it there.  :(  
Thanks for asking! I respectfully decline. I hope you enjoy the course!  
This couldn't  of come at a better time! Thank you si much for this!  
You're one cool dude  
Love it! I'm also going to get started today. :) Thanks for creating and sharing. :)  
Really cool. I look forward to starting this course.  
Cool. Message me if you have any questions along the way. I'm here to help.  
is there a reason why you chose ruby instead of other languages?  
Not OP but they probably picked it up during the Ruby/rails craze.  Plus it's generally considered a pretty noob friendly language.  
I am a law school graduate and the market sucks so I am checking this out!   
How long would it get to get through this course? Assuming I try to do at least 10 hours/week  
In the developer console, I ran JS code to calculate the total time for each course: (Note: These times may change as content is added or removed.)  The Essential Web Developer Course: 23 hours, 39 minutes, and 2 seconds] The Complete Web Developer Bootcamp: 23 hours, 39 minutes, 51 and seconds (This appears to be an older version of The Essential Web Developer Course.) Develop Custom Themes with Wordpress: 6 hours, 26 minutes, and 48 seconds

Thank you so much. I'm 28 and looking to change careers. Stuff like this is invaluable to a guy in my situation. Thanks again.  
Good luck! I'm around the same age and looking for a career change also.   
You need to give your users another choice apart from cloud9 not everyone has access to a credit card.  
You have the option to email them and they can set up a student account for you. Check this comment for the address.  
Thanks a lot man, this looks like something I was looking for. I'm almost 30 and want to change a job branch. I hope, I'm not too dumb for this...  
Much appreciated, this is just what I was looking for, just a couple of quick questions since I have a specific goal.  I'm going to give a shot at coding a calendar app - I do know they're different languages for android and ios- any way here are the questions..  1; what would you recommend to start with towards that specific goal?  2; do you know of some sort of template for that kind of app available to the public?  Any guidance would be really helpful, and thanks again for your time and the course online.   Brahmstalker   
looks awesome. what is your background? and what kinds of things can one expect to be able to do after going through your course? edit: oh wow after going through it, I remember buying this course a while back. how come you decided to change it up to free?>  
I come from a web development background: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, PHP, MySQL. Nice to bump into someone who has taken my courses before. This is a complete rewrite of a similar course I created in the past. It's also nearly twice as long. Why make it free? I think the real question is: why not make it free?  
you the man, rob  
Damn I love Ruby. Did you exclusively do Rails or do you also do scripts from time to time?  
Me too! Ruby is amazing! In terms of scripting, this course places heavy emphasis on Ruby as well as Javascript.  
Sweet   
Cool! You made other dreams come true! Cheers men!  
What about to create a community for the students?  
Weird question, but is anyone else having issues with watching some of the videos? I love the way this is structured, but for some reason, some of the videos, mainly in the intro section, stop or stall and don't really continue even though they've streamed quite a bit. Is this because of traffic, perhaps?  
 because of traffic, perhaps?  The Slashdot Reddit effect, perhaps? FTFY  
Legend.  Keep up the good work.  
Jesus you're a saint. Can you point out any specific differences between this and the Odin project that I should be aware of? It's what I'm using currently  
Your number will grow a ton today, thank you so much!  
Professor thank you very much for making this program available free of charge. I am confident this will be a great educational tool for many including myself to become proficient at web development. Best wishes to you.   
This is amazing. My school teaches Python for the majority of the classes available, so this is going to help me so much. +1  
Calling u/darkhumor21 - have a look at this  
 Buzzword-Free Education  I've been diving into coding for a career change and fuck, I didn't think this was possible. Thanks, the content seems much more approachable than similar courses jam-packed with more buzzwords and bullshit than explaining concepts.

Thank you good sir !  
So nobody seems to have asked.. why are you doing this and how do you think this will stay relevant in future?  
[deleted]  
I can vouch for this, started about two-three weeks ago and powering through it at the moment. Really really great course and well delivered.   I'm sure there are other great courses out there but this is unbelievable that it is free  
Thanks /u/robeenday!   
Just started and already stuck...I'm on "2.Turn Cloud9 into a server" and I can't type the first command (cd ..). It just won't let me. Have tried multiple times to refresh, start again etc. but nothing is happening. Help....me.....please  
This happened to me also, you have to Ctrl+Alt+Delete reboot.  
hey man just wanted to ping you to say reddit hugged cloud9 to death - just wait until the hype dies down  
Wow that's really cool of you and exactly what I've been looking for. Been trying to learn out of books for a while but a course seems better  
True brofessor dedicated to serve humanity ! Thanks bruv!   
Didn't you just post this a few weeks ago?   
Thank you sooooo much man :) This looks fucking awesome!! Can't wait to get started  
Thank you so much for offering this! You're a gem! :D  
I signed up on yesterday and gave it a shot. I really love the videos. I am currently on html. I prefer this method of learning over codeacademy for some reason. I think the reason being is that I am listening to someone explain stuff to me as well as having that same person do the work alongside me. This is not to say that codeacademy is bad, it's just that I learn better on tutorial videos that just reading text. This is why I am excelling at calculus because of Khan and patrickjmt rather than just reading the textbook.  Thank you for making your content free. I am enjoying programming than ever before.  
Would you consider adding the option to collapse the left hand panel that lists the lessons? I only have a single monitor to work with so I'd like to have my screen split so that my browser occupies the left half while the editor is on the right. This way I can have a better view of the video.  
If you want, use the Opera browser just for Upskill and pop-out the video with a little box it puts at the top of a video and this pop-out view stays on top of other windows. I resized it on the bottom right corner with sublime text on the left and what we were working on  behind the video so I could see most of the changes. There is also a couple extensions for chrome that do this but I find Opera's take on it is a lot better.  
I'm in the same situation. Just make the page as big as possible and drag the left half off the screen. I don't know how big your monitor is, but this works well with my 27". I can read everything and follow along well.   
I have 27inch 1440p, what i do is put it on the right and zoom it to 175% it shows only the video with the click next video option still there  
What do you think about trying to master Python? I hear it's good to learn all the different languages, but I'm curious how widely it is used?  
Thank you so much! I just went through every section up until the Startup section. Reading the last step in the intro text made me feel great inside.   
Hi  
I just finished this course for the first time and highly recommend it.  I've tried to learn Ruby on Rails from a bunch of other resources online (codecademy, treehouse, udemy, learn ruby the hard way, thenewboston) and the concept of OOP never "clicked" for me with any of these resources the way it did with these Upskill videos.  The way Rob breaks down everything you're doing with real world examples and how it's used on other websites like Facebook and Twitter made it easy to understand for me. With that being said, even though I went through the full course and have grasped most of the concepts, I still don't feel like I'm ready to cut loose and start working on my own project. Does anybody have any recommendations or suggestions on what to do next?  Now that I understand the idea of OOP, should I go back and sign up for teamtreehouse or codecademy for their Ruby on Rails courses?  Should I put Rails to the side and start learning Javascript + NodeJS + MongoDB from freecodecamp?  Should I go through the Upskill courses a 2nd time?  I'm not sure where to move on to at this point.  
When do you think you will put up more tutorials? Also the course was legit!   
I just finished the HTML lecture. This is some good stuff man. Thank you.  
HEY LEON!  I am an alumni of his previous cohort and I literally work as a senior front-end Dev now from 0 coding knowledge! I am down to field any questions anyone might have about the program from the perspective of a student! Some background:  I went to school originally for biochemistry and medicine‚Ä¶but I fucking hated it. So I dropped out senior year, and have lived in Miami in a side house since 2019. My previous job was literally an overnight security guard at a busy Miami hotel making $14 an hour. My current job pays a little shy of 6 figures USD. It Took me from October 2020 to October 2021 to land my current position, lots of grinding, and a LOT of rejections. Edit: Woah. Did not expect this reception. I notice some dm‚Äôs and comments wondering about how it‚Äôs possible and how I did it.  Guys, it‚Äôs not magic I worked my absolute ass off. No matter what Leon teaches you, it‚Äôs going to be a LOT of work. Like let me not beat around the bush, Leon provides guidance, but you‚Äôre gonna have to push this boulder up the hill yourself.  But to stop nagging you and show some work I‚Äôve done check out my portfolio site at:  Amjadeportfolio.herokuapp.com I also love teaching so I wrote articles on my personal blog at: CodeMonkeyCove.com My old freelance company is: PuffinDesignLab.com My Twitter (as vacant as it is) is: Twitter.com/amjastplayin  
Hey, do you think this is feasible for people outside of US, example in the EU? In regards to the houses, you have to attend the classes even if your in different time zones? Appreciate any answers, glad to hear this helped you change your life in a positive way!  
Hey Radiance! Absolutely, there were actually a good amount of people in our cohort that were not stationed in the US.  In our Cohort, every class was recorded, so as long as you communicate that it is inconvenient for you to attend the classes in real-time you will be fine! But you can ask questions in real time so it would be helpful. if you join the discord, I would be happy to connect you directly with people who are non-US and what their strategies were!  
How can one join (discord)  
Hey! Thanks for helping answer folx questions!  
Senior? Whoa, that's crazy, and if u really really had 0 knowledge is mind blowing, but I believe u, accountability is what really matters, congrats dude! That timelapse (oct 20-oct 21) was from starting the bootcamp till land a job? Or was  your search for a job only? And just to clarify, u took the free bootcamp or a paid one of Leon? Sorry for my bad English:(  
Yup! Believe it or not, it‚Äôs a senior role. That‚Äôs the disconnect. People think that in the process of GETTING A JOB that hard skills 100% translate to your job title.  But I‚Äôd say If you can split your time between how you network and in using the right channels to share the projects and skills you hone, I‚Äôd say the soft skills probably matter a tad more. Devs who don‚Äôt know how to network or how to passively attract attention to their progress and projects are the ones who make those graphs showing all the thousands of apps they submitted and show less than 5% responses. I don‚Äôt just ‚Äúhit apply‚Äù. The whole bootcamp took me 1 year but you will begin applying to jobs way before the end.  Now how did I get this job? Literally was contacted by a recruiter who set me up with a single 30 minute interview with the person who is now my team lead, and we meshed so well that I didn‚Äôt have to even go through the technical round. This took me 8 months of growing my network and failed interviews, but it is very possible, but between the freelance work I was frantically doing to get by, my current work pays way better but is much laxer.  But as Leon will tell you, ‚Äúif you are just hitting apply, you might as well throw your application straight in the trash‚Äù (Keep in mind as well, I was furloughed and this career choice was a huge Hail Mary I dedicated ALL my time into and developing. This was literally about survival for me)  
How did this recruiter know you? LinkedIn?  
Exactly! I would post 2-3 times a week on what I‚Äôm currently learning or about the progress of a project I‚Äôm working on and as long as your title on LinkedIn matches a developer title, the algorithm will direct their attention to you. In this way, I can network without having to do any awkward meetups. Honestly, I‚Äôm pretty introverted in real life  
Also South Florida native here. Could you PM me sometime? I‚Äôve been interested in learning coding for a long time but I just don‚Äôt know what to expect or what type of job I would get into afterwards. I am very computer savvy but have very little coding experience other than HTML in high school.  Thank you!  
That is awesome!! What an inspiration. I‚Äôm so happy for you and hope I can follow in your footsteps.  
If you want to learn to code, this will change your life. Can't make it to class? Recorded classes are on Twitch and YouTube Never touched code before? He starts from square 1! Shy/introvert/don't like talking? Stick to the chat Don't have support in real life? Join the discord and get more support and hype than your family Don't have money? It's free! Not in the US? Leon is Mr. Worldwide when it comes to teaching! 100Devs isn't just a free online bootcamp, it's a whole support network that will be there for you to cheer you on, help you out, and give you a shoulder to cry on. If you're on the fence, give it a try. You won't regret it.  
Let's go! Thank you for sharing this!! Hope you are doing well!  
Hey Leon! Thank you for doing this. As someone who lives in a third world country, this is definitely really helpful.  
Posts like this make me wonder if going back to university was the right choice... but im also majoring in artifical intelligence so it might do me better than a full stack or data science bootcamp  
At the very least, artificial intelligence is cool as fuck. Yes, technically, all the knowledge you'll be learning now is available for free. But you're paying for that degree title (which is a big deal when getting hired, trust me) as well as the guidance and information conglomerate  
Can I just watch the videos on youtube? I'm in europe and timezone doesn't work :/ Also how do I join the discord?  
https://discord.gg/JAzWqSu2Rh Yup recording are on YouTube and Twitch  
If you need any free dev help let me know I was also a teacher for 15 years before coding if that's helpful too  
We can always use the help! Really appreciate it. I'll follow up with a dm. Cheers!  
I'm up for help too if needed  
Sure thing  
[deleted]  
BOOM! LOVE TO HEAR IT! That is amazing!  
Wow congrats! Did you have any prior knowledge or experience? What is your current role if you dont mine me asking?  
Saving playlist to my youtube library.  Already in school full time for CS and working otherwise I'd sign up.  Definitely gonna check out your channel. Thanks for the link.  
Np, when you get closer to looking for a job, feel free to reach out! Always down to help folx get that first coding gig! Cheers!  
I got a degree in software development in may. Been trying to find a job since. Gotten interviews but rarely make it pass the HR phase, in that the hiring manager is interested.  Any tips? I don't think I am doing anything wrong other than just luck of the draw.  
I‚Äôm a former head of HR and now I‚Äôm an executive recruiter, dm me, I‚Äôll take a look at your resume and give you interview tips as well. Happy to help any way I can.  
Do you know of a guide for resume writing that you consider to be correct/good advice?  
Leon, you are an absolute legend!  
Appreciate the kind words!  
Hey guys, I was one of the 65! I wasn't as active in chat as I should've been and mostly watched the replays within a day or two - but I landed a full stack position before it was over (not entry level even)! Coming from a limited tech work history, this was seriously a blessing. And Leon is just..he's the person you want explaining this. Every concept is like a little hug from him. I haven't taken a moment to thank you Leon, my life really 180'd when you reached out to me about this initially. Cheers man.  
"Every concept is like a little hug from him." I think this might be one of the best compliments I've ever received. Thank you! :)   Also, a lot of folx that want to follow in your footsteps of watching the replays and getting a job so thanks for sharing!  
With Leon's help, I doubled my salary and changed careers. He's never asked for a dime- just that I help other people where I can. 100% legend and a GORGEOUS head of hair. Leon also has great music taste, cute dogs, and at some point might even start an OnlyFans.  
Ha, someone reaching enough channel points for OF in 2022 is my primary fear at the moment :)  
You weren't kidding, that is one nice head of hair!  
I found out about Leon through Reddit and I'm so glad that I was online that day. It changed my life. If you're serious about it, give it a go. You won't be disappointed. You can do this.  
Wild how many folx found us, went through the whole program, and now are software engineers because of a reddit post last year!  
 85% of our graduates, most of whom do not have degrees or prior experience, go on to get full time offers at an average starting salary of $98,000.   How do you help them get to that point once they're through the bootcamp? Is it the projects done during the course to place on their resume, and/or helping them make those connections to get the interviews at all?  Do you guys work with specific companies or recruiting agencies?  
The Resilient Coders bootcamp is extremely intense. Like 12 hour days with no breaks for 20 weeks intense. By the end our students are lean mean coding machines, but they also have committed to serious networking each and every week. When they graduate they all have a completed fullstack project that they built on their own from scratch, a network of 100+ people in their area, paid clients, meticulous resumes, portfolios, ect... Plus we have staff whose job it is to bring employers to the table to meet our students as well. It took a long time to get to where we are with that program, but the results have been pretty amazing.  
[deleted]  
No, PLEASE take a break at the top of every hour at least. I meant like no spring break or long weekends.  
I was wondering the same thing and am really glad you clarified.  
No, definitely not. Sure, you can probably do it for a week but doing it for 20 weeks will damage you in the long run. Edit: He meant "long weekends" and "spring breaks".  
I would like to know this too as I have health issues and would need to eat and use the loo.  
PLEASE eat, use the loo, and take a least a break every hour. I meant like no spring break or weekends "really" off for 20 weeks. For the intensive RC program.  
doing anything for 12 hours a day is relatively unhealthy, but if youre really passionate about something and want it bad enough, youd probably do it  
Do not hesitate this is real. 100Devs is a thousand times better than a paid Bootcamp and more responsive than any college program. I tried both and 100Devs is the best.  
Hey, I appreciate the kind words about the program!  
How many hours a day/week is nominal for one to be successful in this program? I really want to sign up, but major depressive disorder is eating me alive....  
Given that he says there is 2 classes a week, that are 3 hours each. That‚Äôs 6 hours of just classroom time, and he said students on average may give around 10 extra hours a week to finish homework/study. That‚Äôs 16 hours/week, devoted to learning. Now realistically i would give around 20. Since you might have motivation problems at first. Set up a schedule for 16 hour weeks and slowly make your way up to 20 hours. (Or stick with the 16 hours if that seems to be enough). If 2 days are dedicated to classes, you might want devote 2 and a half hours for 4 other days to commit to studying/doing homework and also give yourself a day off. The point is, with a system like this, you won‚Äôt overwhelm yourself and quit. Things will get easier to understand day by day. You just have to have the consistency in the time you put in and you‚Äôll finish, trust me.  
I went through the first 100 Devs cohort.  Leon is legit, this course can be life-changing if you put in the work!  We don't get got, we go get!  
Hey, thanks for sharing!  
100devs got me a 6 figure job in tech. This is no joke people! Leon is one of the best teachers I‚Äôve ever had. Just remember that you get what you put in, so jump in and do it earnestly  
This comment just made my week! Thank you for sharing!  
[deleted]  
We do live classes twice a week. Those classes last 3 hours with breaks every hour. Most folx will spend an extra 10 hours a week outside of class completing the homework, working on projects, and networking. Some do way more and some do less.    We use a lot of resources for homework, but I only ever share resources that are free and open to all.    Happy to answer any other questions!  
Can peeps not selected participate alongside?  
They absolutely can. He has discord channels set up for people to work together and help answer questions.  
Everyone is selected. House Turing is the one with the perks, but Twitch channel points unlocks those perks for the rest.  
Can it be done on a phone,  or does the student need a computer?  
I don‚Äôt know, I haven‚Äôt taken the course, but you probably need a computer to code, it makes things so much easier  
I stumbled on v1 of this post in the fall of 2020 and was about 75% convinced that I was falling prey to some silly scam. I signed up anyway, because I was pretty desperate. I had just turned 34 and was working in landscape construction making $40k a year in California, meaning I was trapped in the paycheck-to-paycheck grind. Always had been, figured I always would be. Less than a year later, I landed a job doing marketing and developer advocacy (What is that? Read about it here) for a tech startup and more than doubled my annual income. Between my day job and my freelancing side hustles, I'm on track to break six figures in my first year in tech. I kind of can't believe it. I've been painfully broke for my entire adult life, until now. And this is just the beginning of my new career. Leon gave me the structure and the confidence I needed to see this seemingly impossible sea change through. Don't get me wrong, I put in the work. A loooooot of work. I woke up at 4 am every day for months to study before my 9-5 shoveling gravel and digging trenches. It was so, so, so worth it. 100devs changed my life in ways I'm still reckoning with. I want this so badly for everyone who has stumbled upon this post like I did last year. Sign up! Do what Leon says. He knows how to get you a job. It works. Believe me. You can do this.  
This one resonates with me alot. Im a carpenter (framer) and I don't make much doing this either. I want out badly and am so grateful for this bootcamp coming up. Thanks for this post I'm glad it worked out for you !  
You can do it, too! Good luck!  
all my homies love leon  
Lol, thanks  
[deleted]  
Take the sign or don't, but please don't pay 15k :)  
I was on the same boat last year and then I found Leon. We weren‚Äôt meant to stress over bootcamp debt. Welcome!  
100devs is life changing for real and I've seen it happen for many people first-hand! Good luck to all the new folks who will commit to changing their lives ‚ô•Ô∏è  
I was taught by Leon in both 100Devs and Resilient Coders. Life changing is an understatement. I started my year making LESS THAN 30,000. I currently make more than 3x that at FAANG and guess what? My little bro just also received his second offer. Right in time for the holidays. I cannot recommend 100Devs enough. Leon is the best educator I‚Äôve had in my life and the 100Devs community is fantastic. I am happy to answer any questions!  
Aww thank you for the kind words. Your bro called my yesterday and it made my week!  
I cannot wait to get started in January!  
Happy to have you!  
Signed up for reddit just to comment on this! I was part of the first cohort, and one of the 65 (#23 maybe? I forget) to get jobs so far, and can vouch that this course is 100% the real deal. Prior to bootcamp I had dabbled a little bit with code over the years, but never got past basic for-loops. I went through this bootcamp while locked in my house with my 2 small boys + husband during the pandemic, and it was a lot of work but SO worth it.  Before bootcamp I had been a stay at home mom for almost 6 years, and never really had any sort of career before - just jobs to pay the bills that I hated every moment of. Now I have a whole career ahead of me and a position where I'm appreciated. Leon is an amazing instructor, the live classes are fantastic for someone with attention/commitment problems like I have. I felt engaged and on-track throughout the course, which is huge for me. Usually keeping myself motivated beyond a few weeks is a gigantic challenge. What else can I say? It's all 100% free, that's no joke, and though Leon's drawing skills are pitiful, it's worth every second of your time.  
So cool, thanks for your testimonial - it means a lot that a former student would come back and give this type of feedback. I also tried teaching myself coding over the pandemic as my former career slowly faded into oblivion, but I need the discipline and accountability of a "real teacher" and "real classmates" to check in with on a regular basis. Today I am trying to sign up for the January 2022 cohort but was just wondering, did you need to submit a 2 minute video PRIOR to the very first live lecture, to get access to the interactive course materials? I am seeing differing instructions on different platforms. Thank you!  
My current work schedule should allow me to attend Sundays and Thursdays but Tuesday evening I work. I'd feel bad signing up if it means taking a spot from someone who can attend all the classes. I subscribed on YouTube, and joined the discord. Should I do anything else? What's a good prep for the upcoming boot camp?  
Still join us! We have many folx that have to catch up with the VODs (each class is immediately available after the live stream). If you did those things, you should be all set!   Also, my advice to prep is to spend time with your loved ones during the holidays because your time will be at a premium during bootcamp. No need to prepare anything code related just come as you are and ready to put in work :)  
I work until 5PM Pacific on Tuesday and Thursday but you‚Äôre saying it would be okay to enroll and just do the VOD after the session has ended?  I have full availability Sundays.  
Nearly the same question. I'm out the house at 7am EST and home and done eating (I skip lunch, no time) by 730pm.  I'd love to join but don't want to take a spot from someone.  
I started on my own a few months ago using your recorded classes and am waiting for the next cohort to start.  I can't thank you enough for what you've done for me!  
That is awesome! Where are you in the recorded classes? Excited to have you join us live!  
I'm at (funnily enough) winter break.  Doing the 30 mini JS projects and then on to class 14.  I already applied for a job because all they require is CSS,HTML, and JS, so I figured, why not?  I will not get 100% of the jobs I don't apply for.  
Boom glad to hear it. Feel free to reach out on Discord if you land the interview and want to practice.  
Hey! How can I access the recorded classes? These sound amazing but I‚Äôm across the pond and will be fast asleep when they are happening. It‚Äôs amazing what kind of generosity OP has, need more of them on this planet!  
Probably you overlooked it but the recorded classes of the last bootcamp is provided in the post.  
Oh cheers! I didn‚Äôt read past the disclaimer because I assumed it was all disclaimer lol - which wouldn‚Äôt have bothered me  
This is the best thing on the internet if you want to learn to program! Leon is the best!  
Ha, u/BootieLiquor in the house! How have you been?!?  
I‚Äôve been good Leon! I miss Tuesdays and Thursdays. I‚Äôm gonna be around for this co hort and linger. End of my contract in the trough of sorrow is coming up, I feel like I‚Äôm on the come up!  
Woot, excited to have you back! You are missed!  
Can‚Äôt wait leon! Thanks for all you do  
u/BootieLiquor you‚Äôve been missed! I was just mentioning to another 100Dev that I hadn‚Äôt seen you in a while. Hope to see you back :)  
I‚Äôm gonna be around! Still need to get outta the trough of sorrow  
Hey Leon! I would love to join but if I cannot this time, do you think if I were to go through all your videos from last year's bootcamp on YouTube, will it be likely that I will still be prepared enough to get a job? Hopefully this isn't a silly question.  
Yep, as long as you also help on Discord and take all the networking requirements seriously! We'll be changing a lot, but the key stuff won't be different!  
I am a musician that got completely screwed by the pandemic and self learning web dev for a couple months. This is what I need!!!  
Boom! Glad you found us. Musicians have always done well in my past bootcamps!  
Leon you are the dude! I filled out the application when you announced. Is there a confirmation at all or is it open to everyone  
It is open to everyone and you'll get a follow up email from me in the new year!  
I am currently learning java, would it be wise to take this bootcamp alongside that? because I am pretty deep with java  
Really is up to you and what you want. We teach full stack JS because after helping hundreds of folx get jobs I find it really is the easiest stack to land a job with at the moment. Your Java experience would help and I think you would get a lot out of the bootcamp that is not just learning how to code. We spend a lot of time teaching how to learn, network, and ultimately get a job. JS is just a tool on our toolbelt that helps us land jobs.  
My current situation is that I am a college student in his first year, I work a part-time job, and I am learning java in my free time, I have no particular direction where I want to go with it, all I know is that I love coding, so far I am self-taught and wanted to land a job to help support my family, this could be a great opportunity, the timings also match perfectly with my schedule, Tuesdays and Thursdays are both days I go to college, so I have no shift for work that day, however, I am worried that I will not be able to allocate enough time, I believe it said 10 hours outside the classroom, seeing I have all this and java to learn, knowing this would you still say it is a good idea, because web development does look fun, and this would be a great tool to have. any advice is appreciated, this has been something I have been struggling with a lot.  
People like Leon change the world in the best of ways. Thank you for being a great role-model to many.  
I can‚Äôt wait to get started in January! I really appreciate you hosting this. You are definitely a different kind of light‚Ä¶one that is MUCH needed.  
My pleasure, happy to have you join us come January!  
Hey Leon, thank you for doing this! I would like to join the cohort but I cannot commit to the class meeting times unfortunately. I have been following your YouTube videos from last year. Would I be able to do the same for this year's lectures? Will they available on twitch perhaps as soon as you conduct them? I would like to do as best as I can to do the bootcamp with the time I can spare, I believe you had different houses for different levels of commitment, is that not happening this go around? Thank you!  
Yep! The classes are always immediately available on Twitch and 24 hours later they will be on youtube. We are doing houses again and to apply to Turing you just have to submit a video when you submit the form. We'll also be creating a Discord channel specifically for folx who are following at their own pace, so you will have that community too!  
Woohoo!! Thank you again :)  
How will I know when the discord channel is available?  
I started this class but unfortunately couldnt finish. Leon is a FANTASTIC teacher and an over all amazing person. His community is top notch and they are all looking to help those with any questions. If you've been looking/waiting for a sign........this is it  
Aww stop! Thank you for really kind words. I appreciate it! Think you might join us again this round? Even if not, feel free to ping me on Discord if you think I could help  
I wish I had stumbled across this before I paid for a boot camp which I feel left me largely in debt and no where near job ready.  
Exactly why I do what I do. Sorry you got got. Please send me a DM and I'm happy to set up a time to chat and see if I can help.  
is it still available if im in the UK?, I signed up regardless  
Yep, open to all and we had 2-3 folx in the UK get jobs this past cohort!  
Just looked at the course description on your site. Is this just for black and brown folx exclusively? And only those affected by the pandemic?  
I'm white, was not affected by the pandemic, was not "officially enrolled", but joined the Discord and watched the stream. The only difference between being "enrolled" or not is having Leon personally review your work/portfolio. If you think you don't "meet" the requirements you can (and should) still unofficially join.  
This is a fantastic idea. Will definitely do this if I'm not enrolled.  
Nope, the course is open to all!    I do help run a nonprofit that focus on supporting folx underrepresented in tech though.  
Oh snap, imma apply and not lurk this round.  
Just wanted to say that I think what you're doing is incredible.  Keep it up, it's really inspiring to me.  If I talk to anyone who I think might benefit from this I'll definitely steer them this way.  
Really appreciate it!  
Between my current job and prior commitments, I likely wouldn't be able to reliably commit to keeping up with this real time. How much is lost by trying to follow along on youtube (at a slower pace) vs. being in the live sessions?  
Mostly it is accountability. There is something powerful about going through the experience with an amazing community of peers live! That being said, we do have a strong showing of folx that catch up and really make the most out of Discord. Those folx, I don't think lose much...  
Leon...love you man. You‚Äôre truly the best. The world needs more people like you in it.  For anyone in the comments...yes this is 100% legitimate. Leon is the most humble and kind soul you‚Äôll ever cross paths with. Leon is changing lives. Yes my classmates found badass jobs.  Apply! You won‚Äôt regret it.  
How do help them get jobs? You refer them or they apply themselves? Also, is this feasible for me considering I am not in the US. can I get a good job and stuff after doing this?  
We spend a significant portion of the bootcamp networking and doing the "real" stuff that helps you land a job which honestly has nothing to do with learning how to code. If you complete the bootcamp you will have built an amazing full stack project from scratch, have a deep network of folx to help you get a job, real client work, a great portfolio, and all the little things that help you pass the sniff test and get a job.     We have a lot of folx not based in the US that got fantastic jobs!  
[deleted]  
I would love to join this! is there a number limit?  
Nope, open to all! The classes are live on Twitch and our discord is almost 6000 strong!  
Can you clarify: The link above mentions "looking for 100devs". Is that not the case anymore? There is no limit and this time it'll be open to all that apply?  
This time it will be open for all that apply  
Please spend more time on back end and OOP, seeing how many applicants we're getting that don't know much about those is really disheartening  
Yeah, we are definitely spending more time on OOP this cohort. Are you talking specifically 100Devs applicants or bootcamp grads in general?  
Bootcamp grads, sorry I wasn't targeting you particularly (In in Australia anyway). I'm just noticing that bootcamp is the biggest experience we're getting for junior devs and they've got no concept of OOP  
Hey mate -- reach out to me in dm's, I'm a hiring manager and I can talk to you a little bit about what entry level looks like for my team, salary ranges -- and we do full remote work.  We have a strong commitment to DEI, and are an equal opportunity workplace. I'm a strong believer in banthebox and am happy to talk to people of truly diverse backgrounds.   Our Salary for starting positions is experience based, but generally ranges from 45 - 85k Happy to talk to you about what we look for in terms of understanding and background.  
This is awesome! I started making more money since the pandemic, and my anxiety is way too high to make a video, so I'll stick to The Odin Project. But this is a great opportunity for those who do qualify.  
If you can't submit a video for any reason, just reach out to me here on Reddit or Discord. Happy to find something that works well for you and if not best of luck with TOP. It is an amazing course too!  
Hey Leon! It kinda feels like a sign that this popped up on my feed today because I've been considering learning how to code for a while now.  I got laid off at the beginning of the pandemic which led to me landing in something I'm not really sure is the path for me.  Been thinking a lot recently about where to go from here.  Is it too late for me to start at the age of 35? What's the deadline to apply, is it first come first serve?  Thanks for doing this!  
Plenty of folx were older than 35 and got jobs last cohort. Age typically just means more responsibilities and frustration when it comes to picking up new things. If you have the privilege of time and can limit your frustration, you can learn to code!  
I want this. No, I NEED this! ‚Äã Leon, you're the answer to my prayers! Definetly going to sign up and work hard. THANK YOU!!!  
u/leonnoel Hi! One more quick question - if I'm understanding this process correctly, we ALL join Hamilton by default via the Discord, and we submit an application and a video for Turing (which I did) ... but what determines selection for Hopper, the middle tier? Will certain individuals who aren't selected for Turing be delegated to Hopper, and then the remaining video applicants will be filtered into Hamilton (again, by default, since they weren't selected for the other two Houses)? Thanks for your time. I know I ask a lot of questions. Last one, I promise! :)  
Reality Check: Most of the claims in this post are exaggerations at best, and flat out lies at worst. I am a senior engineer of over two decades working for a multinational company. Nobody we interview and hire would be coming solely from a free web seminar. Basic requirements are a degree from an accredited university or equivalent demonstrated work experience with references, or both. The salaries claimed here are absolutely unreasonable in most areas of the US for entry-level, and certainly not without a degree. Furthermore, the language and nuances demonstrated here indicate a heavy reliance on social manipulation techniques to convince you there‚Äôs nothing to lose. Your time is valuable. Your personal information is valuable. And although the actual knowledge may or may not be accurate, it is very easy to teach bad coding practices and shortcuts. Nothing worth your time is easy, or free. If monetary concerns are your primary blocker, try free courses through many of the accredited universities first, and then see what your local community college can offer. Many times you will be able to attend for free due to grants and incentives in your area, and you will walk away with a real degree. It‚Äôs not a bad thing to be skeptical of a free lunch being hustled at you like a TV infomercial. Remember cults always look like a great deal‚Ä¶ until you‚Äôre drinking the koolaid.  I‚Äôm sure this post will be downvoted, buried or removed because it challenges the narrative, but I hope it saves one person the disappointment.  
Also a reality check for you: I‚Äôve done a program similar to this. No one had degrees. 20-30 people were hired (out of 60-80) immediately out of the program by Virgin, Johnson&Johnson and/or Fidelity as junior programmers making $40k for 3 months part time, then $80k after that training period. I think your ‚Äú20 years‚Äù in the business may have aged you out of understanding how this works these days.  Degrees don‚Äôt mean shit if you can‚Äôt code, and no company, even Fortune 500, turns away people who can just because they don‚Äôt have a degree. That‚Äôs ancient thinking. Edit: I do think this post reeks of self-promotion for that guy who literally used a picture of his face for the lead photo, and he‚Äôs making it all sound very straightforward when it‚Äôs not. But it‚Äôs entirely legitimate if you apply yourself and work hard.  
Please don‚Äôt misunderstand my intentions here. I come from a non traditional background myself and I don‚Äôt see a degree as necessary to being a good software engineer. I‚Äôm more than happy to give a smart kid who has a passion for the software development environment a shot at proving themselves‚Ä¶ but you need to get that knowledge from somewhere and, if you‚Äôre considering this post, you‚Äôre likely looking for instruction and not self-educational resources.  Salary claims and company names are rather inadmissible since none of that could be vetted in the first place. I would recommend someone interested in a career use salary database sites to determine an estimate of what they could make for wages in their area and go from there. I can say I wouldn‚Äôt be offering over $100k to an entry level greenhorn engineer. $40-50k is certainly closer to the mark. (That doesn‚Äôt mean a good junior engineer demonstrating good practices and an aptitude to learn wouldn‚Äôt move up quickly in both position and salary. Companies will typically pay you what they think you‚Äôre worth, so demonstrating that you are an asset will certainly reward you with career opportunities.) Edit: I think we‚Äôre both coming from the same mindset and out of a showing of goodwill I will upvote your response.  
I‚Äôve dug a bit. This guy is employed by Resilient Coders, Inc., a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit, which are organizations operated exclusively for charitable or educational purposes. They are funded through donations‚Ä¶ that are demanded of their students, from reports here and elsewhere. They made 1.5 million dollars in revenue in 2020. There were a reported 1.09 million in expenses. Since they are primarily operating through free platforms online, one questions what those expenses truly were.  Some of the IRS 990 data is odd, such as the salary reporting.  This entire operation appears to me to be a slight of hand business using nonprofit status to operate similarly to a for-profit company, while reaping the benefits of nonprofit status and exemptions. I‚Äôd dig further but I think I‚Äôve seen enough.  
Would you recommend me to join if my knowledge is already good enough for a job but I can't land it? My weaknesses are node and Mongo. I'm looking for a Front End position, so I think my node knowledge is good enough for that. (I know ror too)  
Yes, we had a few folx in your position and they got a lot of value out of the "How to get a job portion". Also, if you message me on Discord, I'm happy to set up a practice interview to see where you are at and what we can change asap to help you lock down a job.  
I see the the course starts on January 11th but how long does it go for?  
30 weeks. Live class every Tuesday / Thursday with Office Hours on Sundays.  
I currently work in a GTM role at a SaaS company, and I‚Äôm interested in getting more exposure to the technical side of things. I‚Äôll plan to follow along ‚Äúunofficially‚Äù - excited to check out the course :)  
Happy to have you. You are in good company because we had a lot of folx looking to supplement their skillset last cohort too!  
Do you need any help?I'm a senior dev (13 years) and I helped a friend learn coding a couple years ago, it was fun. He managed to win a competition at Google but moved onto a non-CS career path afterwards. I have a FT job and can't make a super commitment, but I always thought it might be a cool way to make friends or whatever.  
[deleted]  
Thank you for the kind words and for bringing up the time commitment. It is no joke and unfortunately a privilege that not all folx have at their disposal.  
My brain zeroed in on this very aggressively so i need to ask. Why did you spell 'folx' once like that? It seems intentional.  
It is short, inclusive, and avoids the gang affiliated folks  
As good an answer as any, thanks for answering my random question!  
This is amazing. And perfect timing! Will be signing up in the morning. Thanks!  
Is there a e.g. discord server or something where your students hang out? I'm a sr eng with 10+ years experience and I would love to hang out somewhere where I could help answer people's questions, especially if I could help people under-represented in tech.  
This thread is going so much better than the first one I saw last year. It's truly a testament to what Leon does for all of us. And I forgot to mention how amazing the community is. Everyone in there has great vibes and are always willing to help.  
What about burned out nurses who‚Äôve seen enough over these last two years and want a change? Is there a qualification for that in the applicant process?  If so, how could one best prepare for this class? Any specifics that need downloading, or sites that should be joined! Thanks!  
If you send me a DM on Discord, I will help you get going personally. You are exactly who I want in the program.    The best way to prepare is to spend time with your loved ones and relax as much as possible before program starts as time will be at a premium once you begin!  
How about burnt out K-12 teachers?  
I've signed up for the bootcamp and submitted my form and video. Got on the discord and all that. If we aren't selected, can we still follow the lessons online? just without the added support I'm assuming  
hello can we still join  
It's an incredibly supportive discord, well worth hopping on to see what the fuss is about. I'm looking forward to the next cohort as the community he has established really shines a.light on mental health during the process.  
Glad to hear you are joining us! My life got wrecked by Bipolar Disorder, but I was able to bounce back and soldier on. I love when folx who have had a similar journey join us and def want to create a space where folx feel comfortable talking about the reality of what a bootcamp can do to your mental health.  
Half these comments seem to be bot accounts, what's the angle?  
No idea. I responded to comments for 12 hours straight yesterday. My arms literally hurt when I went to bed, so half the comments are actually mine.   I just want to help people during the pandemic. I'm not a doctor or a nurse, but I can teach people to code. I think I'm decent at it, so that is what I am going to do.    You can not give me money. All of my content is on Youtube for free, I donate all of my Twitch Subs, and any sponsor that joined us last cohort I gave that money back to the community. We did a $5k Uno tournament...  
What the hell is with these bot-like comments, so weird  
This seems like a scam, the sheer amount of activity on this post (compared to the rest of the sub) is absurdly high.  It has become the top post of all time in under 24 hours and many of these comments leaving ‚Äúpositive reviews‚Äù were all posted within the first hour of this post going up.  Just seems kinda crazy, I would love to be proven wrong  
not a scam, trust me. this got a ton of attention early on because leon left a link to this post on the discord. we've become a pretty tight knit community over the course of the bootcamp and tons of lives have been changed because of leon's support so we're all kinda just giving back to him by hyping this post up. you can check out the discord before applying to verify it yourself if you wanna. honestly, there truly isn't an experience like this bootcamp (and for free too). its legit.  
Hi Leon,  I found you from Twitter and excited to start with you and the community on Jan 11. My question is about the Houses. How is it decided if someone should be in House Turing or Hopper?  Regardless on what house I'm in, thanks for doing something like this for BIPOC  
Everyone that completes the signup form and submits the 2 minute video are in the running for House Turing. I'm prioritizing folx laid off during the pandemic. I'll take as many as I can reasonably support and the rest will be placed into Hopper. No need to sweat though, because you can always use channel points to get the same benefits!  
I already submitted the signup form but didnt submit a video. Is it ok if I resubmit it with the 2min video? Sorry I dont want to create duplicate entries for your end.  
I Would love to participate! Unfortunately I will be in my colleges computer language class on tuesdays, but I am free on Thursdays!  
Last cohort we had folx that would miss a class, but catch up with the videos the next day. You are welcome to do that as well! Best of luck with your computer language class!  
Hi Leon, I've been really debating getting into the programming field, and this seems like a great time. However I'm entering with very minimal prior experience. When you say "no technical experience", do you really mean no technical experience? I'd hate to apply for this with only a basic intro to Java programming class from college a few years ago, and realize I need a much more solid foundation.  Also, I applaud you for focusing on getting underrepresented people into the field, and I don't want to make sure I'm not out of line while applying: Is this course open to strictly under represented POC, or could a white male who is currently unhappy in their current job such as myself apply?  
The program is open to all and I really mean no prior experience :)  Most folx that got jobs this past cohort had never really coded beyond maybe a little freecodecamp before joining.  
Are you looking for instructors or guest lecturers? I've run intensive internships-to-hire with dozen+ cohorts and have taught webdev at the Art Institute. Here are some subjects I present on at code meetups.. Let me know!  
Any chance we can get accessibility service for this, such as sign language interpreting or captioning for your courses? I would absolutely love to participate but automated captioning is not that reliable and tend to miss a lot of information.  
We have automated captioning that folx used last cohort. Have there been services you used that have been more reliable than others in the past? I would love to figure this out for others too. Mind if I send you a DM?  
Is it absolutely necessary to have a Twitter for the retweet? I do not have a Twitter account because I believe it‚Äôs a negative impact on my mental health but I‚Äôm very interested in joining the program. Also, if it is necessary and I do make a Twitter I‚Äôll be retweeting to nobody so I don‚Äôt see much of a point lol.  
I'm so glad I signed up for this!! Great community! <3  
This seems very cool, I've done the css/html stuff that Shay Howe put out and am in the process of getting everything setup to do Odin. Now I'm considering attempting to catch up in this bootcamp instead, would that be a good idea? 6 classes behind could be a pretty big gap .  
Uh oh I didnt miss it did i?  
Hi, I just watched the first class today and I really want to join the program!! Is that still possible? I can definitely catch up within a couple weeks  
sure, why not? join the discord and don‚Äôt rush it, maybe double the classes per week do four if you can, but never do more than one on the same day.  
Title had me ready to write a rant. Gratz mate!!  
It was a total bait. I remembered yesterday's post about something related to this and thought it was a rebuttal lol  
Hahaha you and me both ü§£.  Well played, OP  
Oh yeah, I almost bit at that bait lol. I felt my BP start to rise above it's already high level and the reply along the lines on WTF was already forming in my head. Lol  
I was literally typing bullsh.. when I decided to read a bit further.  
Was on the brink of ending it all  
Me too man, with all the people saying it's rigged ohh it's saturated, I was like whats the point and thats me I'm very young and hardworking. Fuck this I'll delete reddit and just fucking focus.  
Hang in there, saturated with shitty devs is exactly right. I can only speak for myself, but I think algo problems are useful--not for making sure you can "think right" or get an answer, but because they will expose people who don't really understand how to construct a loop or access the second to last letter of a string, etc. All I'm looking for in a junior is a solid grasp of the fundamentals and enough HTML/CSS/framework stuff to be dangerous, and it's surprising how many candidates--even those who supposedly have a couple of years experience--can't show it.  
[removed]  
One that I used a lot for junior and mid level developers is:  Write a function that takes an array and a target number and returns any pairs in the array whose sum equals the target number. For example, with inputs of 12 and [5, 7, 3, 9, 4, 6], return [[5,7], [3,9]].  Getting to a solution shouldn't be too difficult for someone who has a solid grasp of a programming language. But many solutions have problems--duplicate answers in more complex inputs, treating [5,7] as a separate answer than [7,5], should 6 count as matching itself, some solutions don't handle weird numbers well--so there's lots of room to keep going. Once a solution is working and correctly handling weird cases, if it's looping more than once try to get it down to one loop. Different candidates will spot some of these in advance and try to work around them, acknowledge them and decide to ignore them until the basic solution is in place, etc. All of this shows me whether you can write code to solve problems, how you work, etc.  
It is rigged. Put yourself in the best position to attempt to beat the rig.  
Honestly, you will be better off doing the last part when it comes to a lot of things. Do your own research and be careful of the negative voices. The problem with the internet is you have no idea who is saying what or whether they are even worth listening to. Just be willing to work very hard at whatever it is you are going after (obvious advice I know).  
Ye, I am in that phase now. Thank God that I am not a pro nerf-gun  
My question is: can anyone be a good dev? I've been working as a dev for a year and I think I'm shitty dev and that I will never be good at it. So I'm thinking to quit.  But good for you. Dev career is a great place with lots of oportunities for those who can actually know how to code.  
It is important to keep in mind that imposter syndrome is real and also very difficult to self diagnose. This is why asking for feedback is important. I imagine you are a junior dev so you should hopefully have a senior or tech lead type person you can go to. I have a Jr dev on my team who thinks very low of himself despite my encouragement due to a heavy case of imposter syndrome. But he builds out great solutions and I very much trust his judgment. This career rewards tenacity and dedication in spades. To answer your question yes anyone can become a good developer. Very few take to it naturally, and I say this as someone who did a ton of tutoring/teaching both academically and professionally. The job will have you learning throughout the entire course of your career. The "bad" developers are usually people who become complacent or stagnant in a space that required more momentum and continued learning. No where is this more intense than in your years as a junior. The problems you tackle as you grow do tend to be more complex but done so with a good deal of experience that allows you to brake things down into small solved issues. The areas where I see the most Jrs struggle are:  Tacking an issue all at once   It pays to brake some of the bigger problems down to workable components. many times I see young devs get into coding with out doing this.  Poor debugging skills   This comes with time, but there are many resources to help you along the way as you develop the tools needed to tackle some of the more tricky situations that come up. I usually start wide and then start isolating code till I get as close as possible to where the bug starts. The debugger wont always just point it out. Most of the nastiest bugs are logic bugs.  Google is a good friend for some of the more common issues.  Asking for help too soon or to late   This one is a hard balance, but anytime you hit a wall try to use it as a learning opportunity. This can't always be this way, especially if there are time constraints. The same way you don't want to consistently hit up your senior/tech lead for every little thing, bashing your head against a problem for hours is also not great. Suggestion here would be to just talk this out with who ever is responsible for your growth on the team. (Be it officially or unofficially) In my case I tell my Jr's to just hit me up and I will let them know if they should dig deeper or if it's something I know they wont find quickly. I tend not to just outright give them the answer but help them think through it.   Not giving yourself enough time   Unless it is the first hour of the morning, and you already know how to fix/do what is being asked. Never utter the words "I will get it done today" unprompted. You will never know what will hit you that day or the thing you need to do could end up being more time consuming.  Not working on your writing skills   This stuff is fundamentally essential to not just creating amazing documentation, your team will love you for; It also helps getting your point across in the many many many many many emails you will need to write.  While on communication! Work these soft skills out   Actively listening is very important. I have seen people with lesser technical skills beat out others for a job/promotion due to their ability to communicate. This happens, don't let that be you.  Last but certainly not lest. Continue learning   This tends to be more relevant to people shifting up from a Jr position, where everyday is learning, to a more advanced role. Just always keep learning, if not for fun than at lest to support the environment you develop in.   Enjoy the vast amount of unsolicited advice from someone who should have been asleep at lest 3 hours ago. If you do end up quitting, which I hope you don't. The problem solving skills you picked up are very transferable. Best of luck, and if you have any questions feel free to reach out.  
First of all thank you for your effort, it really means a lot to me. I saved your comment so I can read it from time to time, specially when I'm in crysis regarding my current job.  Your completely spot on. I can tell you are someone with lots of knowledge and I dont mean only for technical knowledge.  Once more - thank you.  
Thanks for all the info! ü´Ç  
Thank you for taking the time to write this. I've recently decided to start completely over and switch to this field but all the comments make it daunting. I appreciate you being helpful and realistic.  
[deleted]  
I really do love programming. I'm curious and love to learn new things...until I'm at work. Then I got overwhelmed with the amount of the informations, project logic etc. Maybe is because of the project (fintech), but Im the only one on the project who struggles, so its me not the project. Tbh I'm not the sharpest knife when it comes to math and logic. But after or year and a half of self learning and a year of work I just think I'm on a right level to be a good, even decent dev. And don't get me started talking about my coworkers lol. They are like light years in front of me. So I was thinking what to do next and your post gave me some answers. Thank you for that.  
You've been doing it for a year, and they haven't kicked you to the curb, look at the results, not how you feel about getting there to try shaking the imposter syndrome. If you're stressed and struggling, but get the job done when it needs to be done, then you are doing an adequate job with room to learn and grow from your more experienced teammates. Don't discount how far you've already come by comparing yourself to people who started a different race.  
What language did you learn ?  
C# along with .net. Some basic js with react. At work I mostly work with angular thou.  
I've been a developer for nearly 20 years and the are 2 levels of confidence for me. I'm confident about the things I know, but I'm also confident there's way more I don't know. After all these years I've gone from not knowing something to knowing it so many times that I'm confident I can keep improving, keep expanding my skills  
Kinda early to give up but think about things you can do for an org that don‚Äôt involved coding. Engineering manager, PM, technical writer, developer advocate, (sometimes) QA, scrum master, etc. If you ever find that the job is not for you, leverage the experience you got from it to make a transition to something that interests you. I can say for sure a PM who has dev experience is gold for example  
The fact that you think you're not very good is almost definitely just imposter syndrome. Happens to every single engineer I've ever talked to about it.  You've earned your spot just like everybody you work with because your peers think you're a good dev.  
I needed to hear this today! Thank you!  
"Now I have a stable 6 figure salary and work from home at an insanely cool company." GOALS. Hell yeah  
this is the reality, it's not possible to learn and get a job in 2 months.  by the way congrats  
I got my first IT job (analyst) after 2 months studying coding and networking, no degree either. It‚Äôs not standard, but anything can happen. You‚Äôve just gotta be an extremely quick learner and be able to walk the walk.  
I got one in 4 months after getting a cert rare, but it happens  
What cert?  
not the guy who replied to but I did a 16 week bootcamp that I didn't get a cert for and had 2 offers by week 15.  4 years into my career now. a bootcamp arms you with some of the knowledge, the rest is attitudinal  
I was told not to even do a boot camp because it's a rip off and you can learn everything on your own. My issue is time and motivation so it might be worth it? Which camp was it and how much did you spend if you don't mind me asking? Was it full time because I'm a single mom who works full time.  
It tool me 4 years learning to code in my freetime while working help desk jobs. I ended up having to pay for a boot camp just to get recruiters to look at me (major corporations near me love to hire bootcampers). Finally got my 80k junior dev job, it will probably be a couple of years before I strike 6 figures. No regrets because there's no way I'd make this much on my previous job path, but there is no get rich quick schemes here.  
How did you stay consistent in your learning during for years ? I‚Äôm learning too but I can‚Äôt stay consistent as learning everyday  
The only way to stay consistent is to set realistic goals and then complete then. The metric for your goals can be time or task oriented, as long as they are measurable. For example, you might want to do 1 hr per week night of learning, or one learning course a week/month. I allso worked for free on a website/database for a non profit organization I was a participant in, so having a project to work on really kept me on task.  
I know you will not prefer to say the name of the company but Im really curious because its rare these days that people give such great reviews about their companies  
[deleted]  
It‚Äôs Nestle  
My favourite engineering company is Nestle  
They have such good engineering  
They engineer human suffering!  
It‚Äôs actually a new conglomeration called NestleBlackrockFBEnron.blockchain.bit.ai. Im pretty jealous  
Nestle the N in faang confrimt?  
r/fucknestle  
What were you doing before this position?  
Being a dev this is 100% true. I graduated as a sys admin. But my entry level job was boring, low paying, and had a good amount of down time. I had taken 2 java courses in college so I had a little bit of programming knowledge. I didn't like Java probably mostly because the way I was taught it, so I decided to choose to learn something similar, C#.  During the downtime at my sys admin job I self taught myself C#. I got lucky because my company started wanting tiny automations like complex macros and windows forms apps. They had no idea the automation was possible and had order entry people doing the job. I volunteered to make the work automated and it grew into more complex work including an integration with an outside company. I strived to understand all the best practices and when I went to maintain my early code, I realized how important best practices were. I decided to try and land a software engineering job, I surprisingly got 2 job offers. I took one as a software engineer. After 6 years I've been promoted twice and am now a lead dev.  My advice, learn as much as you can. Learn best practices. Look back at early work and see either how much you have improved or where you can improve. Knowing how much you improved will motivate you, knowing where you can still improve will give you more goals for further improvement. Be confident in your answers and stick to your guns but never believe you know everything, always keep an open mind and know you can be wrong no matter how experienced you are. This all probably can apply to many careers. If a dev and looking back at old code, imagine yourself trying to change old code you may never had to in the past. If it horrifies you just thinking about changing the code, the code is likely poor, if your new code feels the same think of ways you can improve it's maintainability. If you feel only you could change the code and would be very difficult transition to someone else, it is also likely poor and overly complex code.  
What are your favorite references that discuss best practices?  
I recently got offered a remote job for 65k and I was ecstatic when they told me i made it. It took countless applications and a few interviews but it's so worth it. I'm not at 6 figures yet but I'm 22 so I'll take what i can get! I start next week :))  
Woah congratulations, could you tell more? Stories like this give us strength  
Thank you. I needed that.  
OP has hit the nail on the head for me. I'm starting my first coding job tomorrow after constantly applying for jobs for around two years, slowly building my portfolio over time.. Relentless pursuit is exactly what it is. Never give up.. ever!  
I needed it too. Currently clawing my way through a college degree and it‚Äôs kicking my ass  
You fucking fooled that guy.  
That salty gatekeeper  
how can i show companies that i m a good dev?  
Do everything you can to show it.  Have a polished github page, with a couple pinned projects that have clean code and well manicured Readmes on them. Have a professional, well formatted, and tailored resume for the position you are applying to. (include links to github/linkedin/portfolio) Have a dope portfolio site with projects that help you stand out. Make sure projects are hosted. If they have any type of auth, make sure recruiters/hiring managers can bypass auth with guest login. Have an active Linkedin with a professional headshot, lots of connections, links to your github and resume, maybe even write articles on there and make (professional) posts Communicate openly, honestly, and professionally. Follow up on phone screenings, reach out to recruiters, attend meetups in person, try to network as much as possible.  Many decisions in hiring are made in literal seconds. Make sure you look serious and well put together right out of the gate. Give as much evidence as you possibly can that you're a serious candidate.  
As a dev team lead who wears a hiring manager hat, items 2 and 6 mean something to me and a little bit of 5. I don‚Äôt care about seeing a picture of you and, in fact, I‚Äôd rather not. I think having a polished github profile has value for the candidate because making and finishing projects is a good habit to get into, but in my experience there‚Äôs never time to look at them. I‚Äôll be reading CVs that have already been filtered by my company‚Äôs recruiters and even then, I‚Äôm trying to do it alongside all the other work on my plate, so it‚Äôs amazing if I manage to spend five minutes per candidate before saying which ones I want to put forward for a screening call.  
Yo thnxx can i just say if you don't mind i would love to see your resume you can clear out all the personal info it's ok if you don't wanna share thanxx regardless  
Demonstrate that you understand that business value is important and that technology in most cases is there to support it not the other way around. Understanding why you are truly doing something helps. Find the logic.  
Ya know I've been working on it for about a year now. Started applying and have been rejected non stop. It's disheartening not gonna lie. I've gotten some interviews and one of them had me laughing at the end. Dude told me I was perfect for the job and even offered me a job... Kinda. Once we finished speaking he said I don't see a degree on your resume.  I replied back saying I am self taught and as he can see through my GitHub page and resume I have the experience. Mind you I'm not applying for anything except junior roles because I don't feel I am ready for anything else. The guy told me well I'm sorry we can't hire you because we only hire people with degrees. It's a company standard and our clients expect it of your employees.  Why waste both of our time if you can see my resume and know I don't have a degree.  Kinda silly but whatever. Hoping one of these other companies will pick me up. Maybe it's the resume which is why I'm not getting a bunch of call backs.  
Positive story in response: It took me 6 months through a self study bootcamp. I worked HARD. I got a job offer in just under 30 days after graduation, getting paid 75k annually. 6 months later I got a raise to 83.5k, and I‚Äôm up for another raise in 5 months when I hit my one year at the company. I work 100% remotely, and work for a great company with a good company culture. 30 days, about 50 applications sent, 3 screening interviews, one coding challenge, one time being pushed forward in my interview process. I got the job networking with strangers on LinkedIn. Cold outreach until someone agreed to have a phone conversation with me.

Sorta my point. Figured it would be good for people to hear all sorts of success stories. üòÅ  
The market is saturated but a lot of these people churn out terrible code. It is easy to set yourself apart from the crowd when the code is terrible and unoptimized.  When I started my career I had it in my head that I would be working with good devs and it got so bad I nearly ruined my entire career. The imposter syndrome hit me hard. But, once I switched jobs I quickly learned that I am just as incompetent as everyone else and there are people that are actually worse than I am. I also realized I don‚Äôt like dev work but actually love QA so that is what I do today.  
Catchy title. I almost gave up everything for it  
Thanks for this. Congratulations on being rewarded for all the hard work  
you had me in the first look, not gonna lie  
was your first job remote?  
[deleted]  
Hope has been restored‚Ä¶  
Do you live in the US?  
Just a question. Are you doing front end or back end?  
[deleted]  
So I assume you mostly work in C99? No but seriously what kind of stuff do you actually do as a front-end-developer? Is it all sort of web interface stuff?  
I wish I was joking, but my friend learnt Flutter& Dart in about 6 months and started freelancing right away, 3-4 months later he used those freelanced apps and got a high paying job. He learnt and got a job in 10 months, that's the shortest I have ever seen someone do it.  
they call me Nandor the Relentless  because I'm so relentless  
 ignore anyone who says the job market is saturated... ... it's all about relentless pursuit   These statements contradict each other. In a saturated market, a small number of people (only) can get a job if they pursue, relentlessly. That doesn't mean it's not a saturated market, it means it is one. If there's 10 people for each vacancy, nobody's denying that any one of them might get the job,  but there will always be 9 that don't.  
I disagree. The context between those two statements matters. It very well may be true that the market is saturated for junior devs (aka less than 1yr worth of projects). However if you work hard to become a dev that knows some skills (and can prove it with projects/work), the job market is suddenly not quite as saturated anymore. That's my interpretation anyway.  
 People say the entry market is saturated, but it's saturated with shitty devs.  In other words: The entry-level job market is saturated with entry-level devs. In an industry that is also having an issue with a lack of experienced devs, I think it's reasonable to hold the industry itself responsible for failing to cultivate that experience. OP is certainly correct that the best way to succeed in such a labor market is to, basically, not be an entry-level dev. But OP should be honest that that's what is being said in this post.  
Beautiful. Well Done.  
Needed this motivation! üî• Congratulations!  
Thank you for this post. Last night I was in the trough of sorrow when I couldn‚Äôt get my calculator to work in JS. This gives me hope.  
Ignore the noise, keep your head down, focus and never give up.  That's all I tell myself when people laugh at me for having goals and aspirations that those very individuals lack the creativity and discipline to achieve.  
What if you‚Äôre on the wrong side of 30‚Äôs and have never been in the tech field? Asking for a friend.  
I have a strategy. I've done a bootcamp and that school is looking for teacher assistants. They hire illumni for that position. So, I'm going to apply, get them to pay for my bachelor than set out to the job market.  
This is a common path ive seen people take  
Glad to hear that. I'd rather walk the path well traveled than fight my way through the jungle. It's all uphill anyways.  
congratulation to op and this post is helpful to me  
The title had me stunned. Here been coding for 2 years. Pretty good at it and going for a degree in CS. Yet to make a cent from my skills.  
That post about the job market being saturated is also very localised. In my area there is still a massive shortage of all kinds of IT professionals.  
Honestly 3 years doesn't even sound too bad! Not to detract from your effort ofc, that persistence is the hard part :)  
Congratulations! On average how much time a day and how many times per week did you put in?  
After reading through these comments it's really helped my anxiety about my progress in learning. I'm finishing a biology degree and my grad school project was going to doing a lot of data analysis and compiling so my professor suggested getting familiar with some programming languages in order to help speed it up once we started. Since then I started the free courses in Data Camp and then moved to Coursera to learn Python. Starting out I didn't know how I'd feel about it but I've enjoyed the critical thinking and problem solving involved in how to get the desired results from a program, but at times that I get stuck I just get really down on myself that I'm not cut out to be abke to do programming. I really want to be able to continue and succeed with it and reading some of the stories in here has really helped calm down that anxiety  
Perseverance Pays.  
I love this post. I find most people on Reddit are toxic so this is refreshing. I'm still searching myself.  
This is a very encouraging post, the previous post was interesting. Though a bit dour.  
As someone who now mainly has to hire devs I can add one other point‚Ä¶ do NOT underestimate how important your communication skills and ability to interview are.  You may be the best programmer on the planet but if you‚Äôre unable to communicate with your team and coordinate properly, you‚Äôre an albatross.  Also don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for more money if you feel you‚Äôre being shafted, your pay in the future at that company will be largely percentage based, so the higher that number starts out‚Ä¶ PS - Fun fact, you probably make more than your manager after your second position, or at least you should if your manager knows how the hell to retain good talent. Congratulations OP! Sounds like you nailed it. :)  
congratulations on everything, and this is definitely a motivating post for anyone starting out  ‚Äã  It's all about relentless pursuit. People say the entry market is saturated, but it's saturated with shitty devs  but if that wasn't true why would those 8 companies reject you? don't mean to be rude just curious what you think the reason was.  
[deleted]  
true, thanks for answering.  
Job market is saturated? For the people saying so, where do you live? Programmers are invaluable right now to furl the technologic "revolution".  I mean, thousands of companies is asking for data scientist, programmers, data crunchers, et.c. It must be the best time in world to be a programmer and, for people that aren't, learn to program.  
I laughed so hard.  
My eye twitched when I first read the title.  
Love it!  
I don‚Äôt know if what you have said is right, you given me hope so I given you upvote  
Are you down for a small q & a session ? I have some questions  
It‚Äôs all about experience from what i heared. I‚Äôm a first year cs student and I‚Äôm already looking for internships  
That title brought me here. Congratulations Sir!  
What should I learn? So many codes I‚Äôm confused‚Ä¶ I wish you the best!  
Thank you.  
u/browat As a complete beginner to programming who is also interested in the web develolpment field, can u give me kind of a roadmap as to which language I should learn first to get started (any courses you recommend?) and what next.. like a general guide similar to what you did?  
OP, you‚Äôre a good human. Thanks.  
Congratulations! Nice to see a dose of reality and really good advice on reddit.  
So how long it took for you to actually learn ?  
Would you mind elaborating more on the three years of hard work? Does that mean you pursued a degree? I have significant qualms with the higher education system and would like to disembowel most of those institutions, much less attend one if at all possible. I already know I can hash out some stuff with python based on nailing my friend's "programming" final on their behalf, so if your story involves self-teaching and stuff like that, I'd love to hear it.  
[deleted]  
Not OP but in other replies he said his degree is in Economics  
I want to get into the coding field, where should I start? Should I join a coding boot camp?  
I‚Äôve been doing The Odin project and it‚Äôs been great. Free, make sure to join the discord. It‚Äôs been great so far.  
This is really motivating for me to go back to 100 Dev and follow through to catch up the missed classes!  
Mind telling us what technology?  
Thanks. I was thinking the jo market was saturated but then I changed my mind.  
What boot camp did you attend?  
This gives me hope  
Are you American working at an American company?  
Where did you find the jop? Like linked in or what?  
Do you have degree in computer science or you are self taught?  
hard work pays off  
 Relentlessly pursue your goals, and you will achieve what you set out to do.  This is the way.  
Damn. I quit my job the moment I saw your headline. Now what should I do?  
I want your help  
needed this!  you are an inspiration!!  
What's your path? Web dev?  
I thought you are one of those Ivy league big brain nibbas who don't highlight that 80% of their entry to FAANG(now MAANG?) without coding background is because of their Ivy league degree. Not saying they ain't smart though.  
I'd fuck this guy to get some of his power  
Congratulations! If you don‚Äôt mind sharing, what is your official title?  
Is it self taught or did you go to school?  
I have a CS degree but only basic coding from c++ and python, but I need months and months of self-teaching to be able to say I can code in python, and then I can find a bootcamp for $ 6k and THEN I can apply for a job. I‚Äôm already 36 and tired.  
Your post title drew me in. Learning the reality forces me to ask. I remember learning a small amount of some language in high school and pretty sure we got a small course in VBasic at college. As someone who aspired to work as a video game developer when younger, is there any recommendation you could give for someone effectively starting from scratch. What language ought I learn? Aside from video game development is there any focus that could be useful that I should approach? I'd love to learn to code I just don't have the understanding to know what I'd code. And yeah, I could Google it for sure, but humor me on the basis I'd like the human aspect. Someone whose maybe been there before and can give me insight instead of me feeling like I'm staring into an abyss. Thank you.  
Any advice on reputable places to learn to code? I assume where you learned is a big factor for employers since it‚Äôs so competitive.  
best post I think I've ever seen on this sub. thank you. a lot of people need to hear this.  
Where do I start? I‚Äôm a novice.  
 People say the entry market is saturated, but it's saturated with shitty devs. Become a good dev and you will have companies crawling to your door to hire you and keep you as well.  Yeah, well, if I could get past the ATS that'd be great. I don't want to hear it's my resume.  I've changed my resume a thousand times already.  I'm bitter and angry and I hate searching for a job.  
 Ignore the top post on this sub, ignore anyone who tells you the job market is too saturated, ignore everyone who rejects or doubts you.  Agreed. Also, the only people crying about job market saturation are beginners who  have little to no YOE, and they are worried all the jobs are being taken from them. I can't think of any other groups of people who would cry about made-up saturation.  
Just to know. Are you in the US?  
OP are you self taught or CS degree ?  
OP what was your major in college?  
How good did you get to land a job? As in, what topics did you learn well and could you describe what projects helped you land that job? Thanks in advance!  
Awesome!! Congratulations!! Which courses did you take ?  
Great post  
What separates a good dev from a shitty one, attention and care for quality? Creativity?  
In my experience, most of the traits that make a good dev boil down to cooperating with the team - Easy to read code vs overly complex - Very little ego about the right way to solve a problem - Follows the team's conventions Technical stuff is a lot easier to learn than good people skills  
I‚Äôm a year into learning to work on the Salesforce platform. Proud of you stranger! That‚Äôs the dream.  
where I live the job market is saturated with want ads for programmers.  so much that I wish I had taken software engineering instead of electrical  
That title was about to be the single most motivating title I've ever read. I was like DAMN if this person can do it then there's no way I can't.  
Thanks. I needed this today.  
Is it normal working hours for the remote job?  
Haha awesome post. But if I'm supposed to ignore the top post... I'm confused now. System overload  
What work? Type? Languages? Base location of company?  
What a motivational prep talk with a sticky title, nice mate!  
Congratulations man  
Hey man, love your passion. As a developer who is married to a dev recruiter, can confirm it is a developer‚Äôs market for sure. There is all the opportunity in the world for someone willing to put in the work.  
Enjoy the fruits of your hard work., am here still trying to get past the basics.  
Never give up friends.  
This is true. My company ALWAYS has dev positions open, because it's hard to find good devs. The problem is we only hire really competent developers. The only entry level devs we hire are from our intern programs.  
This was actually true in the 90's (except the remote bit).  
I feel like the legitimate time frame to tell ppl going from zero is 1-2 years. 100k maybe not, but a $75k job in 1.5 years to me doesn't seem unrealistic.  
Did you go to college? What was your major?  
Would it be possible to see your resume so I have a good idea of what a good resume would look like? I‚Äôm just getting to the point of starting to apply myself  
Based on your title I bought a brand new pitchfork and torch. Now I have to see if I can return them... well done!  
Dick! Had me fooled!!  
Same, my current job is good and my future prospects look pretty good.  Took me about 3 and a 1/2 years of building stuff that seemed like junk but was teaching me a lot.  Just keep writing and reading code bros(broettes).   I even took breaks from coding entirely when i was learning but i still thought about it, read about it, and thought about the kind of stuff i could try to build.  I think 3 to 4 years of consistent problem solving and serious investigation of multiple tools used In real work flows will get you a job.   Try to get freelance work, build shit for friends and family even if its free ‚Ä¶. You don‚Äôt have to complete every project you start, but complete the component(s) of the project that demonstrates the project concept is sound.  Cloud certificates can be valuable, but at the very least cloud resources let you prototype with tools you might not have on the cheap. Its a massive industry with lots of openings and the core work force is retiring or about to retire.  Get the fundamentals down, find the course that speaks to you that is geared towards teaching you the foundations of any and all languages.  Then read and write code as much as your brain can handle.  
Holy shit. I was abt to doubt my entire existence.  
Nice buddy  
Great one!! I came in hot ready to be like this mfkr... Random inquiry: Resume. Was it important? Did you have to change it up multiple times? I have yet to land a first interview... I've had a few different formats, I like the current format the best. But still, no interviews. If you happen to run across this comment... How long did it take to get your first interview?  
It's been around 3 years for me now. Just started applying for jobs this week (junior so not 6 figures yet!) and the first weekend test I got is already overwhelming. But I am really looking forward to working in this field :)  
May I ask, are you an IT graduate? :3 really thinking of shifting my career.  
what are your exact certs  
we love to see posts like this  
Ah yes another wonderful post I will bookmark to never look at again  
Are you me?  
Are you both me?  
Omg... me?  
Are me you?  
Always have been.  
I feel seen.  
Wow I have never felt more attacked  
This sub is the best. You are the best. Thank you sir.  
You're welcome!  
 Syllabus  Couldn't agree more! Thanks a ton for this.  Amazing work.  
[removed]  
You could probably get a job moving biohazard  
By the buttload?  
It‚Äôs about 400 boxes per load, takes about two days and pays very well.  
now just stick to it and who knows where you'll be 3 months from now?  
probably still at home  
I'm stuck in tutorial hell and need to GTFO  
trying everything... even thinking about boot camps  
Don't need to spend more money, exiting tutorial hell is more about making a plan that will get you either where you need to be, or where you know more so you can make a better plan from there. Gotta be doing the thing in a focused way every day to improve. It'll take time and you'll fall off track, and when it happens then you gotta look at why, and how you get back as soon as possible.  
Have you checked in on the 4th person? They doing ok?  
He died. jk he's in college and not looking for a job.  
 He died  75% success rate, I take it.  
Pythons are dangerous.  
 He died.  Well that's a risky syllabus!  
Tell him to start! He‚Äôs screwing with your stats!  
Christ. I'm on mobile and didn't scroll enough to see you were joking. "He died." lol that shocked me.  
I just realized this is a joke. lol  
Thank you  
You're welcome!  
How long, roughly, did it take for each of the four people you mentioned to work through this?  
Two were going at it full time and completed it in a little over three months. The other two have college classes and didn't quite finish (so I guess my title is a lie).  
How many months?  
lol my bad. 3 months. I edited the comment to fix it.  
Did you tutor them when they had issues at all? What do you do for a living? They got jobs in 3 months from start to finish?  
[deleted]  
You can do it in this order, but it's not required. Each item has specific prereqs defined.  
[deleted]  
I absolutely hate notion after being forced to use it multiple times for various teams, it‚Äôs just not for everybody dude.  
Curious where the hate is coming from? Is it the performance because it sure can be slow at times, especially on mobile.

Why do you dislike the website?  
Thanks!  
Thank you!  
Wow this looks complete as fuck  
What framework/libraries are you working with? I set the localStorage debug mode true and it is really cool how the UI is clickable and explorable from a debugging standpoint.  
Do you mean on the pages I linked? That's Notion. I didn't make it.  
Oh I've never heard of Notion, I assumed you invented it and that it was the framework you build for the syllabus you provided, but now I understand that you just used Notion to build the syllabus. Still neat!  
I'd like to make something of my own for managing non-linear syllabuses.  
Yeah that could be really cool. A nice pretty graph or tree structure instead of a list structure could help people explore a topic without feeling so robotic in methodology. I think the biggest drawback of something like that is it puts a lot more of an impetus on the creator of the syllabus to also define the edges/connections in your structure. So, having a nice simple UI for drawing edges from node to node would be an important part for that apps success, IMO  
I think your upcoming python library for managing syllabi (latin plural) should be called Syllabython.  
I‚Äôm commenting here at 430am so hopefully someone responds at a later time when I can actually look at this and not forget it‚Äôs here  
Hey don't you forget this is here mister.  
Ayyy we did it!! Thanks man!  
Leaving a comment in case you forgot  
You guys rock  
Hopefully you havent forgotten  
Hey don‚Äôt forget to come back!  
Thank you so much for sharing this syllabus.  After doing a quick search, I came across Think Python which seems like an updated version of How to Think Like a Computer Scientist Think Python is available for free as a PDF or HTML  The original Python version of the book was published by Green Tea Press with the title How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python.   Taken from the website  
I wish there was something like this for Kotlin. I would have a ton of fun with that. Thanks for sharing though  
What background knowledge/prerequisites does one need for this? I'm absolutely new to programming. I have done a tiny bit of Matlab and C. I have done a lot of math if that matters.  
You could get by with nothing but you'll find the beginning fast paced.  
Alright. Will check it out. Thank you!  
Saved. Thanks for the syllabus, and the work you obviously put into this. I was laid off due to covid and want to learn more about coding without shelling out a bunch of cash. If I may ask: What kind of work have the people who have used your program found, and how did they demonstrate their knowledge and ability sufficiently to get a job? One more question: What hardware and/or software do you recommend for someone wanting to learn on a budget? Sorry for the noob questions, gotta start somewhere  
He got hired as a full stack engineer. Django backend and Angular frontend. I think he knew a tiny bit of JS and they were willing to hire him and learn. For hardware and software, it really doesn't matter. The syllabus is based on using PyCharm, which isn't a super lightweight program. So probably some computer made in the last 10 years at least. Windows/Mac/Linux all have tradeoffs and it isn't a huge deal. It's more distracting than anything. If you have very little money, you could use a computer from a recycling center or a Raspberry Pi. If you have tons of money, you could get a new Macbook Pro.  
 If I may ask: What kind of work have the people who have used your program found, and how did they demonstrate their knowledge and ability sufficiently to get a job?  Sad that I had to waddle through all the generic "thank you" comments to find someone skeptical about OP's assertions. Feels like as long as we read something nice we stop having a single skeptical bone on our bodies.  
oooohhh ill check this out... for the code book by petzold a quick google search led me to a free pdf of the book...not sure about posting links like that herer (so i wont)but wanted to give you a heads up... as your link just points to amazon.com to buy it. ‚Äã thank you for this.  
All of the books linked are available some other way. But I think it's worth supporting the authors because the information is so incredibly valuable.  
Libgen has the pdf, if you can't afford the pdf rn. You can always buy the book later, like OP said, to support the authors.  
I may or may not have done the same thing when I was super broke and learning to code, then bought the books with my first paycheck.  
Very excited to check this out when I'm back at my desk on Sunday -- just stepped into Python as my first language :). Thanks for your effort & making what you can freely available!  
Thanks you for sharing!!!!  
Nice, i cant get past telling ppl how if works, "well if only executes 'if' the condition is true". And then i get a blank stare. At that point I smack the keyboard on the ground and hand them an english dictionary  
I'm assuming this exact story is hyperbole, but I hope you don't actually get frustrated with people for not understanding that definition of an if statement. It's not really accurate. The if statement executes either way. It's the code block that might not. And if someone doesn't know what an "if" statement is, they probably don't know what a "condition" means in this case. Explaining stuff is just like coding. You have to define your variables before you use them. That blank stare is an undefined variable exception. Explain truthiness ("In English, a lot of words mean 'no'. Like 'nope' and 'nu-uh'. Well in Python lots of things mean False, like 0 and None."). Then explain the parts of an if statement (if, condition, code block). Then how it works, then a few examples. It'll take longer, but they'll actually learn it and you'll both be a lot happier.  
For sure, i wrote it for jokes, never happened lol. The inaccurate description of an if statement was intentional though. It is what id usually use until a better understanding of code blocks is achieved, an attempt to somewhat simplify it.  
Well then my whole comment was a bit much.  
Nah, i completely understand where you are coming from  
There's a special slot in heaven reserved just for you.  
Awesome, thank you  
You are a good man thank you  
Ok. I'll do this since I have the time. :D Thanks a lot OP!  
Oooh now I get it, thanks! I'm starting tomorrow.  
How cool, thank you!  
Thank you. Has anyone done similarly for JavaScript and C# ?  
The Odin Project is like this but for JS and way better. Dunno about C#.  
Oh. Thank you. Will check that out.  
It's not just for JavaScript. It also covers Ruby, Nodejs on the backend.  
Awesome!!  
Thanks so much!  
Thanks for sharing! I'll make sure to add it to my bookmarks and forget about it like everything else.....JK i'm going to at least start it :D  
I‚Äôve been wanting to learn Django, thank you!  
I'll be starting it this weekend.  Thank you for sharing your knowledge and expertise.  
Thank you so much! If only someone could create something similar for machine learning too  
Crispy. Thank you.  
Thanks!  
Thank you anon!  
Ah thanks. I am exactly looking for this. I have done some freecodecamp and looking dor something pythonic backend. Thx  
Thank you so much.  
Hi Travis. Hope you‚Äôre doing well. I‚Äôll look into this. Thanks!  
Thank you for a wonderful share!  
Awesome! Thanks!  
Just checking but am I supposed to just read the first two books straight up cover to cover?  
Nicee, I've tried doing the same at https://domecode.com/  
This is probably the wrong question to ask, but I‚Äôm relatively new to python and I know there‚Äôs many different ways to apply the language (robotics, machine learning, data science, etc).  Does this syllabus point people in a certain direction while learning?  
This syllabus is about django, and django is used for backend web development  
Dude, this is amazing. Finding and collecting a variety of resources is super daunting for any newcomer such as myself and putting this together for us is a great effort. I'm working on that first resource right now and just wanted to let you know.  
This is absolutely breathtaking. Thank you.  
Thank you so much!!!! And Notion is great, thanks for using it!  
I really love vscode should I really try and do pycharm anyway ?  
No.  
So if I do cs50 first I should be able to handle this course right after?  
[deleted]  
Yeah just tick them off when you get to them and make sure you have those skills.  
Thank you!!! I have no computer industry background and been laid off because of Covid. Really want to switch career and my friend inspired me to work on programming. I‚Äôve been in the ‚Äútutorial hell‚Äù for a good 4 months... right now need some guide to proceed. Hopefully I can succeed. üí™üèªüí™üèª  
Hats off to you OP for this wonderfully helpful post. Being a heavy R user, it's only been a few weeks that I shifted to Python because it's quite versatile from ML to web apps, everyone seems to be using it. And this post couldn't have come at a more opportune time!  Thanks again :)  
Heya , thanks for posting this, it may help me before I apply for Fresher job in October  I am half way done with my python udemy course and currently I have developed my first project using selenium web driver , I want to start with django from next month , where should I begin using your syllabus.  
You could skip How To Think Like A Computer Scientist if you want.  
Wait does it have maths. ? , If yes I won't skip that , I need to get better at maths and my logic at same time so I am currently studying discrete maths and will start data structure soon.  
There's some math and lots of talk about data structures. Look at the table of contents to decide if you want to do it.  
I'm gonna try this thank you sir you're doing golden job for this golden sub.  
I'm halfway through Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. What should I do? Continue the book and finish it or start this? I think I'm stuck on Tutorial Hell  
finish what you started. You must have done it for some reason right, finish it first and on the side just go through the content i yhink you might find out yourself...  
what kind of job did he get?  
or what kind of job can you apply for once completing this?  
Wow this is neat af! Ill try this out since I have so much time on my hands due to quarantine  
I am discouraged with the amount of information on this post.  
If I manage to get a Job and got my first salary I'm going to give you a beer how about that? Is that a good trade? thank you so much man this gives me hope and sense of direction.  
That's a great trade.  
u/TravisJungroth - Sorry if this is a dumb question, but what does "HackerRank: 30 Easy" mean? I clicked the link and I've solved dozens of Python problems, but my rank is like 200,000. I signed up for their 30 days of code, but I can't advance that. I don't know when to stop. Did they change their website?  
Solve 30 hackerrank easy Python problems. Then, a total of 60 and 90. There's some screen in the Python path that show how many you solved. Or, just filter to Python and count them by hand.  
Ah gotcha, that makes sense, thanks for the clarification. I'm enjoying the syllabus so far!  
Nice, glad to hear it.  
This is great, but I have a question:  I'm going through 'How to Think Like a Computer Scientist' and I think its a great resource, but the exercises take a long time.  They're not necessarily difficult, but time consuming.      I'm trying to Learn Python / Django for a project, and between work, the books, and cspy I haven't been able to work on it at all. Are the exercises necessary? I'm not new to programming per se but I've only taken 1 year of CS classes so I have some gaps.  
None of this is necessary. If you want to put together a Django project, you can do that in a weekend or two. If you want to be good at coding, that‚Äôs going to take a long time.  
Wow, thanks!   I didn't expect a reply to an old post.  Thanks for the honest reply; my Gunnery Sergeant,said, 'the most important thing is life is consistency' and imo he was right.    The hard thing for me right now is I feel like I'm on a timeline, and rushing is never good. Thanks again for putting out such an awesome resource!

This is awesome thanks again for all the work, it's exactly what I was looking and I love that you gear it towards employability as well. I'm picking up python after giving up on programming a year ago when I got stuck and frustrated. I'm taking a different approach this time and trying to structure my learning and diversify so this will hopefully help make the difference. Edit: I know this may be unrelated but do you know any good resources for qa and automation. I'm currently trying to get employed as a QA engineer, but with no direct relevant skill despite coming from an traditional it background I'm finding it daunting and the lack of resources for qa at all let alone automation is making it difficult. Thank you again.  
This looks amazing, thank you for posting. I‚Äôm currently starting open source comp sci track and will start this tomorrow too. Thanks again for this!  
Hey! Great work but I only see two items with the green check and the introduction says that I should pick the green check ones.  
Those are the two things that have no prerequisites.  Copy the syllabus by following the instructions. Do things with green checks. Mark things as completed as you finish them. More stuff will get green checks. Do those.   
Wish I could upvote 100x. Trying to learn python as my second/ third language after C++ and wasn't sure how to do it.  
Thank you. This is something I've been looking for recently.  
Epic  
Class this thanks. Mentor me üòÑ  
Can you please do the same for C++? Pleasee.. :)  
It would be a really good idea for people doing the django projects to group up and set up wekan or trello and start using boards to work on teams. A lot of people when they learn to code do it alone and don't know how to manage branching, rebasing, forking, etc.  
Thankyou so much.  
Saving this post. Thank you  
commenting so can come back to this post  
For an absolute beginner who has just basic knowledge of java and oops, how much time would it take to complete the syllabus? If one spend 6-8 hours dail?  
Thank you for your work  
Thank you so much! I was looking for something like this.  
Can anyone do same for Android Dev?  
I‚Äôm really looking forward to sinking in to this. Just recently started picking up Python with Automate the Boring stuff. So having some more resources and projects to continue my learning is very exciting. Thank you.  
Saving this post!  
Thank you  
This is great, op. Thanks so much for the effort you put into this! I can‚Äôt give you an award, but please accept my gratitude ‚ù§Ô∏è  
Thank you, this is helpful.  
thanks OP! a year from now i bet you have your own youtube channel named Professor Travis :)  
Thank you! I've been considering joining one of those coding bootcamps  
This is cool, thank you.  
Can you learn this from scratch if you have no experience in the field?  
Kudos!  
Thank you!!  
Looks great  
I love you  
Thank you.  
Thanks  
Thanks!  
[deleted]  
The Odin Project might be something for you then. Also focuses on Ruby and back-end stuff.  
Is there something like this but for data science?  
Nice thanks for you hard work in helping others!  
Thanks for sharing the syllabus. It is appreciated work.  
Very cool! Thanks!  
Thanks a lot üôå I usually get overwhelmed by all these tutorials and fancy videos.  
Hi, can you please do something similar for Android development? Stuck in tutorial hell. Thanks a lot!  
I cannot recommend CS50 enough. It's a fantastic course. It's tough, but it's probably the best intro course I have ever taken. Plus, DJ Malan is in da house.  
would you say the estimate of 10-20 hours a week of homework is accurate?  
It really depends. For me, it was a total of about 5 hours(edit: a week*), but I'd already been programming for a while (something like seven years) before I took it. I've helped a few people through it, and for for most of them it was under ten hours a week. One student I tutored took something like 18 hours on average, but I don't know how reliable that is, since it was his parents keeping track. (As in, he might have been "working" on it while simultaneously playing League, so, yeah.) All in all, I think most people who are eager to learn this kind of thing will probably average closer to 10.  
Probably 16 hours playing League, 2 hours rushing to finish it.  
I used to do homework all the time too. Ha-ha, don't tell my mom.  
League oh the hours I wish I could have back from playing it. All 2500 of them  
Amen dude. And it's not only the hours spent playing, but also watching, reading, waiting, etc...  
[removed]  
It definitely depends, but for the undergrads I taught that didn't have any programming experience 10-20 hours a week was pretty much the case.   
You'll end up somewhere in there. Some psets are easy, some are more difficult.  
I know it's in the recommended reading but buying the Absolute Beginner's Guide to C was a HUGE help with CS50 for me  
Common name for a book what is the authors name or ISBN?   
ISBN-13: 978-0789751980 https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Absolute-Beginners-Guide-3rd/dp/0789751984  
I got the book and have actually taken a break from the course since I find the book to be so helpful in understanding. I'll resume once I've worked through it.  
I got to meet him when he came by the LaunchCode Mentor Center in my hometown of St. Louis, MO. He's really nice and willing to talk to a budding programmer like myself.  
I'm in the cs50x through launch code now. This is the first run through here in Rhode Island   
[deleted]  
What is the subreddit?   
/r/cs50  
Thanks!   
Something I don't understand - do you have to do it at a certain time? Or can you do it all any time? Do we have to 'attend' lectures as they are given? Is it all within a given timeframe?  
I'm enrolled in it right now, they give you all the materials you just have to finish it before a certain date. I think it was December for this one? Or September? I don't remember. You can watch the lectures at any time and submit the homework whenever you want to, you can even submit them all at once on a given day. The only requirement is that you finish before the deadline.  
Are the lectures all available as of now? Or are we in the middle of the course with more yet to be released?  
Everything's available, and the only hard deadline is December 31st.  
All available as they're using the recorded lectures from last year.   
Okay, thanks for the info.  
[deleted]  
yeah how does one start this? im looking at it right now but cant seem to figure out when it starts or how to start it  
Sign up through EdX. The deadline is Dec 31 2016 for this version of the course. Yes, it is pretty confusing to figure out at first.  This link is where you access the current course materials, homework, and submit homework:  https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/info  
Is there another semester of it after the december deadline?   
If you actually take it for credit, yes. Lectures and sections are posted, problem sets are due by noon on the assigned day (you usually get 5-7 days to complete). Tests have to be taken at a proctored location. That being said, you can easily just follow along with the class on your own time without officially registering as all videos/psets/materials are posted on the site. -source:Took it for credit online through Harvard  
Mom! I'm going to Harvard!  
Yer a harvard Wizzy!  
Hell yeah man!  
Even if you slack a little, this is stuff more people should know in this age.  
How would one put this on a resume?  "Sat in on CS50?"  
This is what I don't get either. I'm currently enrolled through EDX as well. Why would this be put on a resume since it's an intro course? It's not like you mastered Java or anything. Sure it's from Harvard but they do these certificate things for like every course I've seen on EDX. I might as well just list every college course I've taken.  
If you haven't got a CS background, it's to show you've learned the fundamentals in an actual University course, not through some 5 hour lesson on codecademy  
This is the point I tried to make. Why would putting an intro class on your resume show you have what it takes for a job? I imagine you'd want your resume to be one page long. Putting this is a waste of space.  The class is great to take for the knowledge alone. One of the best, if not the best, intro course to CS on the web for free.   
It can be good if you are a self taught only person, since the entirety of your education would come from online sources/courses and other reading materials.   
Often times you can have a section on your resume titles "Relevant Coursework", where you'd put, obviously, relevant classes you've taken. You could probably put this on the list and call it Harvard CS50 or something along those lines. Or if not, perhaps it could be put in a a "Skills" section   
I put this on my resume under a title of continuing education, where I listed course names and the institution behind them. Been happily employed for several months now   
You pay for the certificate.    
Certificate of Mastery in Computer Science from Harvard. Source: I have one.   
[deleted]  
The core of programming logic, how binary works, loops, format logic, API usage, simple graphics logic, etc... a lot of things. It's good to do if you are wondering if programming is something you should study. I did it a couple years ago and now I'm on my second year of CS, I certainly recommend it!  
I've been considering checking out a lot of these online classes I see from top uni's, but they always sound like they're going to be a fairly rigid time commitment and my schedule is too chaotic for that. Is this something you can actually do a bit of here and there, or is it more of a do everything on time or gtfo kind of thing?  
they offer the course with both timelimit and with no time limit, if it's still the same, meaning if you want to take 2 weeks to do a job of one week you can.  
Do you know if there is any other resource for these types of things? I was looking for a book (or something similar)  but I couldn't find anything fitting what I was looking for.  
Tbh I've looked at some resources online but nothing I've found comes close to taking classes in real life.  However, if that is not an option, I think Harvard and MIT have their intro to CS classes free online. They will be more boring than taking the random Coursera or Code Academy course but, in the long term, they will be better. For some fun starts and what not you can look for edx/Coursera/code Academy courses and then find games that relate to the lesson you just took. This is incredibly more helpful than simply taking the course and moving to the next lesson!  As for where to start exactly, I can't help. Just look around for anything that says intro to programming or so in those educational websites mentioned above. Some good languages to start would be Java/C/C++ with some people recommending Python but I haven't personally looked into it. Good Luck!  
Thanks for the reply. Sorry to keep picking your brain but, do you know if those intro to CS classes are ones where I would need to pass in work? If it's just a recording of a lecture, a bunch of text, or anything I can consume at my leisure it would be perfect, but anything else and I'm better just sticking with the web resources. Anyways, thanks a ton for a good beach head for further learning!  
it teaches you that harvard is fucking awesome. Muppets and gourmet buffets. And it makes you very very bitter.  
Yeah, that too.   
CS50 is kind of atypical of Harvard courses. It has significant corporate sponsorship that funds a lot of the cooler/free stuff parts of the course. The year I took it, Microsoft hosted a hackathon at their Cambridge office with tons of free food and other swag. They also gave out Windows phones to anyone developing a Windows phone app for their final project.   
Cake after the first lecture.... Snippets of awkward 2005 Mark Zuckerburg.... The "peanut butter jelly time" song... So much attention to detail and random cool stuff in every lecture. I'm so jealous right now  
Ah dude don't remind me... I was so salty random horses showed up and started licking me...  
I'm actually a teaching fellow for this course, so I'd anyone has questions about it I'd be happy to answer!  
[deleted]  
It depends on what you learned! Java syntax is quite similar to C syntax, and C++ is even closer, however there are definitely still things to learn in C. Notably from CS50, topics such as memory management (malloc) and pointers are discussed, and while that exists in C++, it definitely does not in Java.  I would say psets 3-6 would definitely be interesting to you, and psets 1-2 might be good review as well, and shouldn't take too long.  The other psets are web development stuff, and would definitely be different. All of this is moot, of course, if you want to take the course for certification which you would need to complete the entire course to fulfill.   
I second this question, would love an answer

How much technical experience is needed to start on this course?  
I took it as well - the answer is as close-to-zero as you can get. If you can boot up your computer, they'll get the rest of the way.  
Ah shit, that rules me out.  
None, actually. This is an introductory course.  
As the others have said, pretty much zero. CS50 spends the first week or two teaching the very basics, and really walks you through concepts like binary and whatnot. It's truly an intro course, and the difficulty comes with the problem sets which, for the inexperienced, may take around 10-20 hours per problem set.   
[deleted]  
It's an intro course. No knowledge required. The course is great. c is a lot older than java and there's a lot more bookkeeping in it; but if you don't mind that go for it.   
If you can sign up for the course and can do simple arithmetic, then you have all the knowledge you need.  
No prior knowledge required. When I took the course as a freshman I'd never programmed before. I certainly was lucky to have this course as my own intro course, but don't be discouraged that you're not at Harvard! There are plenty of programming courses and guides online.  The only thing that I would recommend is you learn good style to keep your code readable, and also maintain good programming practices even if you're not being graded. For example, to multiply two numbers, say 5*3, you could just do 5+5+5, but that's silly. Similarly, when writing programs you should try to retain and implement code that's efficient and readable, even when no one is watching!  
This is a dumb question, but is there any negatives to just dropping the course after the first few weeks if it's too difficult?  
No there isn't. Edx doesn't display the courses you've dropped (from what I remember).  
No, it's actually common to drop because many people taking the Edx course have other things going on in their lives (job, family) and CS50 is a full college course. There shouldn't be any pressure to stay unless you want to for your own benefit.   
My goal is to be an entrepreneur, but I am more UI/UX design oriented than pure engineering (I still learn programming to produce MVPs for proof of concept) Would that course be good for what I want? I aim for an all round understanding in software engineering to properly communicate with my future team, but focusing on deep subjects in engineering is not my core competency.  
Yes I think CS50 would be! It's a great introduction to computer science in general, and then ends with some work in PHP and JS. That would put you in a good place to pick up material that's more what you're interested in, which will likely include some JS.  Plus, if you need skills in doing UX/UI for other platforms like iOS or Android, the other parts of the program that you will need to write will have a good foundation from CS50. Also remember that UX/UI isn't just about programming how things look, but the importance of getting good user input (say when you ask the user for a value or text) is part of the UX, and it's easy to make mistakes that make your code vulnerable to hacks/attacks if you don't know what you're doing. I think CS50 covers the basics of computer security well enough for you to be aware of what you need to look up later in your career.  Let me know if you have other questions!  
Thanks for replying! I always wonder how much one must learn to "Get" software. In HBO's Silicon Valley for example, even though everyone has a different expertise, they each somewhat get what everyone in the team does and it seems like every startup could use any one of Pied Pipers engineers as a CTO (maybe not an effective one - but still). What it takes to get to the level where you "get" what the people in a team are each doing? I would like to effectively communicate with every person in a company or a startup (not to the extent of doing his work - its impossible). Is this what CS101, CS50 and other intro classes help you with?  
Well, as with anything, most people on a team of engineers probably wouldn't know everything that's going on in the team without at least spending some time working with someone else's code. What ends up happening is everyone on a team generally works on their part of the project, and hopefully everyone is making their code as modularly as possible so the parts are interchangeable.  However, most engineers on the team would probably be able to at least understand the code in the other parts of the project after browsing it for a while, even if it's in a different language or whatnot. With programming, most of the commonly used languages out there are actually quite similar, and once you've learned one language it's generally very easy to pick up another. So, a course like CS50 would definitely help introduce many topics on computers and programming that you could apply to projects, even if CS50 doesn't specialize in one field really.  I think most engineers would definitely appreciate that their manager actually understands what's going on in the code, however as far as how to be an effective manager of a project or the stuff you discussed with Pied Piper, that's not really CS50's goal. It comes back to the fact that CS50 is still an intro computer science course for a degree, and really does more in terms of computer science and programming than anything else.  Oh, and to go back to how much it takes to get to that point, CS50 might be enough for you so that any more you need to learn to just understand what's going on can be learned as you go, or explained briefly by whatever dev is on the project. If you continue to learn programming relatively intensively, even if it's not a class, you could probably feel pretty comfortable with most code in a year or so (with some help from google, of course).  Hope that answers your question! Let me know if you have any more.   
I was just about to start prepping for a bootcamp by learning the basics of JavaScript and Ruby (the bootcamp focuses on Ruby on Rails, JS, React, Flux, SQL, etc) and I was wondering if it might be a bad idea to try and take CS50 while learning JS and Ruby for the first time? Would it be confusing to try and do it all right now? I have a little programming experience from a few years back taking a C++ class at UCLA but really haven't touched it since the class.

Here's my thoughts on the course http://reallifeux.net/how-watch-and-code-saved-me-from-coding-hell/  
[deleted]  
[Watch and Code founder here] Jesse - Thanks for the kind words about Practical JavaScript. I found EloquentJS to be wayyyyyyyyyyyy too confusing for everybody (even with my notes), so I'm going to take them down. Now that I have Practical JavaScript, it just makes sense for people to do that instead.  
sweet ill check it out. do you know how long, on average, it would take a beginner to get through that course? Just so I have a better idea of how much time I should expect  
Currently the course is just under 8 hours of video, so you can get through it in 1-2 weeks if you're focused. There's also new content that gets added every week.  
Wow this is amazing, thanks a lot for sharing  
If you already have a project or course in mind for JS and Ruby, just stick with those.  
I think it depends on what you want to get out of your CS education. JavaScript and Ruby will be very useful to you if you want to go on to do web development, and give you a lot of practical knowledge to work with. CS50, at least when I took it, will be entirely in C++ and will focus on very basic CS concepts like search and sort and algorithmic run-time; stuff that is foundational if you want to do real developer work in the long-run, but isn't very practical to know right off the bat. It will teach you how to think like a programmer but won't teach you anything about how to actually write code to make an app or website work. In fact, I don't think they even touch on HTML or javascript until the last two psets.   
thanks! thats actually really helpful. Its probably best for me to try and get through this bootcamp which focuses on web development and come back to CS50  
 real developer work  what do you mean by this? Of course knowing about different search algorithms and their runtimes is important but 99% of the time when you need something sorted or searched, the built in sorting and search functions on most high level languages already implement the most efficient algorithm.  
sure, you could just use the built-in packages, but if you want a job as a software engineer beyond simple web development work, you are going to have to know why those sorts and searches behave the way they do and why some are preferable to others so that you can choose the one you want as well as customizing/expanding upon it. Using a 'black box' approach won't cut it.  
hmm do you have any examples of real developer jobs that would require this? just curious on what I should be getting in to.  
What bootcamp are you going to?  
KISS Army bootcamp.   
You absolutey should have a basic CS course. The bootcamp is probably going to focus on language-specific things and will be taught by people who are geeked up for those languages, whereas something like this is going to be more generic and core concept oriented.   Yes, it's "in C" but it more uses C, as a low level language, to teach core concepts.    
You can officially register for the course on edX. They have a certificate program for $90 or you can enroll without the certificate for free. Here is the link  
If you enroll with a certificate can you still go at your own pace? (as long as you finish before the December deadline)  
Yes, you can. Certificate or no certificate, all you have to do is finish it by December 31.  Also, for some people, the money for the certificate is a huge incentive to actually finish the course so it might be worth it.  
I started this course. My relationship with all its bullshit, fights, arguments, stress and demands from my girlfriend fucked it up for me. What's sad is I actually managed to get approved for the certificate free of cost because I qualified for one of their scholarships. I'm going to start it now and if she tries to get back into my life, I'm going to tell her about how much it meant to me that I finish this course before I hang up on her. Take this course seriously. If you have some bullshit going on in your life, you need to cut it out or you will drown.   
Can someone who knows nothing about programming take this course as a starter course, or are there better courses out there for me?  
There are definitely other courses/starter programs that can help you get going in a specific direction (such as codecademy or courses), but I found CS50 to be so incredibly helpful building up my programming knowledge from basically nothing. It's definitely a great place to start!  
I will give it a go  
You can definitely do it if you have some patience. It's not a breeze, but all the basics are described really well and it's very organized. This subreddit will also be happy to help you out while you do the work!  
Great! I will enroll   
Cool! I'm not that learned on the logistics of the EdX program, but I am a teaching fellow for the course, and if you have any questions about the material let me know!  
Wow, you guys are so nice!  
I'm keen to enroll too. Let me know if you want an accountability buddy or just someone to chat to about the course as we go through it.  
That would be great!  
Does anyone know the differences between this course and MIT's CS 101 course?  
[deleted]  
MIT's course is supposed to be harder as well.  
Do you mean 6.01x?  
I'd like to now this as well! I haven't any experience in C and wondering if this, MITs or Udacitys would be better suited.  
The best thing about this course, to me, is the breadth and the depth of material it covers. I am someone who has taken multiple CS courses in college, done a codecademy sequence here and there, and read the first two chapters of numerous programming books. There were always holes in my knowledge. So I always felt like I needed to start from the ground up. So I would start some new book, or online resource, and then realize I was just learning things I already knew (for loops, variables, etc.), so I would skip ahead because I was impatient, then get frustrated because I was missing things. CS50 is perfect because it starts at ground zero, but doesn't waste your time.   
Wow, that description fits me pretty well. We'll, you've convinced me to set aside some time for it, thanks!  
Where do you sign up?  
https://cs50.harvard.edu  
Thank you  
Do you sign up through edX or am I missing something?  
Through edx  
File under: Great Ideas that I will Never Do.  Save.  
I learned things from the Intro video, can't wait to see what else there is.  
I've always wanted to learn some basic programming skills. As someone who has never tried, is there any sort of just basic 2+2 stuff I can start with?  
It's an introductory course with no knowledge assumed - early lectures should cover those 2+2 basics.  
It builds you up from nothing to give you a strong enough foundation that will allow you to jump into an algorithms and data structures course.  
How much weight does the certification hold? Would you recommend it or should I go the free route  
Don't do it for the cert, do it for the knowledge. The class is also free.  
probably none  
No need for the cert but treat it as if you were. Don't slack because you get way more by doing it 100% as if it counted.  
[deleted]  
It's usually open until the end of the year.  It's a one semester course.  
For those of you who completed this through edx, were you given the opportunity to change your mind about getting a certificate at the end or do you have to decide prior to starting the course?  
There is an option to upgrade anytime before 31 Dec 2016.  
To be fair, you can link your cloud9 account - so in theory I ~think~ someone could register for free, try the course work, after doing a couple psets, realize "I like this", make a new account, register with the paid route and just link their cloud9 environment and submit their already completed psets. Yeah, it's not as easy as "click here to upgrade!" but it seems like it might be possible.   
Thanks Harvard  
Started taking MiT's 6.00x a while ago on Python. I really enjoyed python but never finished the course die to time constraints being in multiple AP's. Ended up starting this course recently instead of going back to 6.00x ( Would still totally take that class if you want to learn a more modern language while still getting the principles of CS).  Switching to C programming feels like going to the stone age but the class's lectures, walkthroughs, and assignments are way more exciting and engaging so far. Cs50 definitely is more developed as a class with features such as its own online IDE. Loving the course and I plan to use it as a prelude to my self studies for AP CS come senior year.  
10-20 hours of homework a week? Shit... I don't even have 10-20 hours a week free to do things I actually enjoy!  
To be honest, that's wayyyy more than you'll actually use. The real thing that'll "waste" (which is not actually a waste but actually really good stuff) is the lectures that are about 1 hour each (normally 2 lectures each "topic", which makes it about 2 hours per topic, at least until where I got into the course), and about one more hour of homework, maybe 2 or 3 if you're slow (or have absolutely no background in CS or computational thinking). That's what I wasted at least, and you'll only waste more than that if you're trying to do something perfect, which is certainly not the point of the course. OP is saying a big number for the sake of saying it IMO. Also, you have about 20 something weeks until December 31, and the course has 2 weeks. You can easily use 2 or 1 and a half weeks for each topic and still finish in time. This makes the course about 1.5 hours a week until the end of the year. If you don't have 3, or even 1.5 hours a week to use for something like this, then you might not be the target audience of the course so to speak (which is students and people that want to get into CS).  
So how do we sign up?  
It was on iTunes a couple of years ago--iTunes University.   
Cab we go directly to specific weeks or we have to do one buy one in order?  Reason being that I'm only interest on  7-9 (Web dev)   
You can go directly to the last weeks for web dev, however CS50's focus is definitely not the PHP, JS, and SQL aspects. Personally, I think those are the weakest elements of the course, and really only exist to break up the constant work in C, where the next things to learn in C ramp up significantly in difficulty (systems programming sort of stuff).  If you really want to focus on web dev I would suggest looking for another guide or course, though unfortunately I can't recommend one since I'm not that familiar with the options out there.   
You don't have to pay for anything - and yes, you can skip around as you please  
Can you do this from anywhere or only if you're a US citizen or somesuch?   
Unless you're from Cuba, Iran, North Korea or Sudan you should be fine (this isn't a joke btw).  
I'm not sure about the certification, but you can certainly do all the material yourself. It's good stuff, and to be honest I don't think the certification holds much weight.  Just go to cs50.net for all the material. The work is under "problem sets".   
will this be of any help if I am looking to learn server side programming? Because I am not really sure what all goes into coding for the server side.  
Yes. They go in to server side programming with php. You get to build your own web app.  
Wow..that is something that I have been looking forward to learn. Can you suggest any other tutorials that cover just this topic? I am comfortable with the basics of programming.  
Look at "Microsoft virtual academy". They have a ton of video classes and tutorials that go with various "developer paths", one of the main categories is all server related. Note: it probably isn't worth it to take the MS certification tests.   
For those who just want to watch the lectures and follow along without the EDX shit, you can find the lectures on YouTube.   
Saved :D  
It's hard  
I am beyond stoked that you shared this. I plan on going back to finish my degree but all of the certificates I am earning will certainly help so thank you!  
I am about to be a senior in high school next school year, I have taken very basic programming classes in school already (HTML, CSS, Java) and will be taking AP comp sci next year. Should I take the class suggested in the OP or should I just come in with a relatively fresh mind in my AP class next year?   
JUST DO IT.  Or not, it doesn't matter. It's better to be over prepared than under prepared.   
Little question, the videos are divided into 2? Is week 0, continued the second part of the first video? Watched the first one and thinking about following it  
They have class twice a week, so that's why they are split up. And yep, it starts with "Week #" followed by "Week #, continued"   
so do I take it via edx?  
I can't recommend it enough either. I have my certificate and I'm super proud.  
Did u use your certificate for job applications   
I'm still in university, I'm a senior. But yes I will.  
thanks EDGAR  
You're welcome, ROBIE  
Also, if you take this course and are in the St Louis or south Florida area, look up the Launchcode program for apprenticeships. I was able to get placement through them after taking this course.   
Can a deaf person take this course? As I understand it, these lectures are live and therefore won't be subtitled?  
There are subtitles and they are in multiple languages.  
I took this course last year when I was about 4 months into my programming journey. It took me near 5 months to complete (due to full time job) but I credit my initial surge of understanding to cs50. I learned so much in that time. It really gives you a strong foundation of programming principals.  For those who don't know, the course is primarily taught in C. This is why it can be a little difficult at first. I started learning JavaScript as my first language so jumping into C was definitely a challenge. There are about 11 weeks in the course, with the last week being your final project. You can make anything you want using anything you learned in the class (C, PHP, JS, HTML/CSS). There are 2 lectures a week along with plenty of other videos highlighting concepts that need to be utilized when solving that week's assignment. Every assignment has to pass the test cases given in order to receive credit. Can't recommend it enough. David Malan was fascinating to listen to during ever lecture.  
Would it be normal to put this kind of thing on a CV? I always feel it makes me look amateurish compared to people with lots of experience or qualifications. Especially because I see lots of people saying only degrees and experience matter.  Is that just me having an inferiority complex from switching careers and getting some bad advice?  
This is kind of a stupid question, bare with me please. Is this course worldwide or just restricted to specific countries? I'm from Egypt and I would very much like to learn programming from a great university like Harvard. I read half of a programming book on C++ and I am familiar with some stuff like loops, if statements, variables, pointers, etc. What are the requirements of attending this course? I'm going to a CS uni in a few months, but until then, I'd like to learn more before I do, lots of free time and I'm very eager to learn!  
Go to ed-x and sign up. It's worldwide. They have people all over the globe. It'll take a while and you have to be committed, but I think it was well worth it! Good luck!  
Thanks.  You just changed my life with this.  
Looks like I missed the boat on this one? Made an account and it says that the course is closed. Will it reopen soon I wonder?  
Hey, it's not. It is still open :)  
.  
We can just drop in the videos whenever we feel like it to learn?  
Ya, there's no schedule or anything like that.  
Will I be GE after this course? Ok sorry i'm out Edit: Well that was stupid of me. Did not notice the sub it was. Will not delete since its againt the rules but i guess you can downvote to oblivion.  
How in depth does he go into week 5? Are you expected to fully know and understand and be able to implement them after week 5?  
I'll be taking this in school sometime this upcoming year. Would it be a good idea to check this out now?   
I have been on this sub long enough to know that people don‚Äôt come here to help other people, people come here to make themselves feel superior.  
It's that way in a lot of subs where people who are specialised in that topic will enjoy shitting on people for asking stupid questions, it's really sad and it discourages people from engaging with those communities. Laughing at/berating stupid questions is biig small pp energy, it doesn't make you smarter, I think it's just a big red flag for insecurity, like people who aren't so smart eager for any opportunity to be the intelligent one. Maybe it comes from those who suffer bullying themselves when they were learning? Sounds like exactly the kind of toxic abuse cycle humans are so great at.  
The most difficult thing for me right now as a beginner (and I‚Äôm truly starting from zero) is how many people ‚Äúexplain‚Äù something in JavaScript without actually explaining it. For example, the videos I‚Äôve seen about recursion that just say it‚Äôs a function that calls itself. Like I‚Äôm glad that makes sense to you dude, but help some of us out who don‚Äôt have a good visual idea as to what‚Äôs happening. It took me asking a lot of questions to figure it out, and when I did I realized it wasn‚Äôt me it was the terrible explanations.  
I have that same problem, especially at school. Some professors forget they have 20+ years of experience while I‚Äôm like a newborn baby in this field, and they explain things like I‚Äôm a fellow professor. Best things I‚Äôve found it to just consult multiple sources in learning a certain topic.  
Glad i am not the only one that feels like this with Javascript. Are you following The Odin Project by any chance? Felt like there was no introduction or explanation of Javascript compared to HTML/CSS.

Fucking compiler can't do shit  
Which really sucks. It seems that people who are in the technical or practical fields seem to have an awful egoistic superiority complex just because they already have years of experience.  
I find that's the case with junior and younger developers who are helping other newbies.  Obviously it doesn't apply to everyone, but that group tends to give advice with a harsher and more pretentious tone ... advice which is also frequently wrong. The more senior the commenter is the more gentle and understanding their answer tends to be.  
Facts  
Yup  
This is your first ever contribution on this sub. Don't lie about other people's intentions for no reason, especially when you have nothing to base that opinion on.  
I agree There is a lot of snobbery in anything that takes a lot of time and effort to achieve skill at, but along my way I've also found a lot of helpful and supportive individuals So it's best to keep the best in mind or you'll associate your passions with negativity  
TLDR; f the haters. I sub to help people here, that's that  
Yea, I gotta keep that in mind since I'm starting to notice the negativity in the things I'm passionate about. Best self advice for me is to not give up and be stubborn about my passions.  
Don't get discuraged, and especially not in a learning sub like this one. There are some reasons people downvote that aren't entirely self-evident (formatting, unclear questions, and every so often because it smells of schoolwork that some one wants an answer to and not an understanding of). Also bare in mind that a lot of people who are offering help are people that are learning too, and computing at large is a riddled with textbook engineers who will scoff at any approach that runs counter to the last thing they learned or their intuition. In some regards it can be a bucket of crabs, if that idiom lands. But, and I'm sorry to say this, it's not much different working in the sector from time to time. I might be being too kind to some of the people in this community but I always try and apply Hanlon's razor when taking feedback from people; Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity. My advice would be if you ask a question and someone hasn't given a decent critique of either your approach or a viable alternative solution I would almost discard their actions and comments out of hand. This is, of course, easier said than done. Good luck and keep up the good work :)  
My advice would be find people in real life you can talk or a couple people to work on a project together. I've been doing this for 10+ years and noticed huge difference between forming relationships with my fellow developers and asking questions to internet communities. Start a discord channel and invite people you like to talk shop with or work on something with.  Also side note: I forget what it's called but there's a theory or principle that states if you want an answer faster post the wrong answer claiming it is right. Says a lot about humans especially when their identities are anonymous.  
But for all the negativity, I would hope that you have at least come across some inspiring and passionate people? Any true devotee to a passion should realize the struggles and want to help others improve. I realize a lot of successful people like to step on others' backs, but I can't help but think there is a lot of us that aren't like that at all  
When I posted likely stupid questions on StackOverflow, providing the info you already dig up, queries and assumptions helped a lot in getting an actual answer instead of bunch of downvotes and shut down by moderators.  
I've posted here, stack overflow, and other places before, and most of the times you feel like quiting programing from some of the responses. They make you feel stupid. I try my best to always help people when I can and when someone responds and helps me I make sure they know I appreciate it. I'm actually a bit ashamed of the community and some of its members.  
I had a fight on this very Reddit with a few people who disagree with this point.  I can't remember exactly the topic but it was something about "make sure you google before asking blah blah blah bullshit". I basically argued that newbies don't know "what" to Google and used the example of my 11 year old student who often writes weird rubbish into Google and clearly hasn't developed his knowledge to the point where he even knows what he should be Googling.  I got downvoted to hell!  
 ies don't know "what" to Google and used th  how? I didn't have this problem and I learnt mostly in my bedroom. You act like noobs are learning by themselves with no documentation, no courses. The fact is probably all of them are taking courses and no what to google which is why they are asking questions here. Maybe they don't know how to google keywords. I personally just think theyre lazy. It's taken me days to fix tiny little bugs before but it helped and helps me get better  
Just keep an open mind about it. Not everyone is going to be helpful because there are some who are just arrogant(the majority). But also do know that there are people who are truly willing to help without putting you down(the minority) It's just a matter of identifying who those people are. Let's be real here, it's the Internet. There will always be arrogant/snobbish people behind a screen. Edit: I remember when I first got this reddit account; I asked a question and I was met with some arrogant/rude/toxic people who just didn't help me at all. But then I asked a question at another forum and gosh they were helpful. Not going to lie but I was so surprised to know that "hey, there are actually people who are willing to help". Best of wishes.  
Unfortunately, not everyone is always nice about helping out. They do it to show off and prove that they're better than you. However, I like to think that there are still quite a few people (myself included) who are always willing to help out. Don't let other people's egos get in the way of you doing what you love. Keep going, and you will enjoy it even more. Have a great day! :)  
to be fair a lot of people ask senseless questions and as we all know, coding requires (a lot of) searching on the internet. With some of the questions asked, it's as if some of them put in 0 effort and just want others to do their work for them  
In my fairly limited experience, most of the posts getting downvoted have one or more of these: unclear or no question, no code formatting, asking for the whole solution, not even close to enough information or simply didn‚Äôt read the FAQ. While I‚Äôm often too lazy to either up or downvote, I will much rather answer the other post that took the time to properly post a question than the one who didn‚Äôt.  
I stopped asking for help here because of one user who is always a bit of a dick. Edit: Wow. I just realized he's a mod.  
[deleted]  
I was expecting to receive replies from negative people when I wasked over there, but the irony was that I received help and new informatioin when I did so.

As a newbie I‚Äôve actually had a good experience on StackOverflow. Though, I didn‚Äôt know you were supposed to accept answers and got called out for that. I know now.  
explains why my post got casually ignored. ;-;  
It wasn't ignored...it was removed as a rule violation.  
;-; what ? why?  
Since it's been removed, I can't see the original post.  Based on the title, my guess is it was an ad of some kind, so fell under rule 2.  
oh shit did I not mention (not ad) I think I did but I really wanted some help on that tho. I guess ill either post again. it was about joma class and if anyone had signed up  
If you ask something that can be answered simply by pasting your question into Google (Or the Reddit search bar), you're showing a lack of respect for everyone here who takes time out of their day to answer genuine questions. Same goes for "asking for help to fix a code". I'm not saying your intent is wrong in any way, but you need to realize the difference between asking people to "Fix my code" and asking "Could someone explain what this-and-that means in this piece of code?". A third reason why I'd downvote a post like that is if the code isn't formatted in a code block but simply pasted as plain text.  
Yeah, you have a point about searching first before posting. I always make sure to search up concepts and code examples or similar questions to mine before I ask for help.  
Some people learn better by asking questions and having discussion. I'm here because I like helping those people too. Throwing the book at them doesn't help a lot of the time. They want a person to talk to, not a machine.  
There's a specific section in the FAQ about that  
I understand the point of it and I still think it doesn't capture what I mean. I get some people become frustrated answering the same questions repeatedly. Having a conversation where you have a personal connection has a very big positive influence on your ability to remember and understand. Some times when tutoring I can repeat verbatim from the lecture but it sticks better anyways.  I don't think taking other people out of the early learning process helps the people trying to learn. The balance is in not frustrating the people trying to help.  So, I understand why it's there, but to call the questions disrespectful and not genuine is too much.  
dude, like Halfspacer said, many of these questions are answered by googling. We're in 2020, one question will give you 100 different blog articles and 100 more youtube videos answering the question very well. ‚Äã Another thing is people asking for resources ... That's what reviews on udemy and comments on youtube are for. Also googling ...  
 many of these questions are answered by googling.  My point is that many people deal with learning better when they can talk to someone about it. Looking at someone else's conversation doesn't always have the same effect, especially from a support standpoint. There's a lot more behind it than just information.  
I want to help people, unlike some other commenter assumed. But yeah, if the answer is in the FAQ or literally a Google search away, it means that the people who help you put more effort into it than you yourself have done.  
But sometimes in the beginning, even knowing what to Google puts your brain into a blender. Now googling answers is fairly straightforward for me, but when I took up coding, I used to constantly get frustrated at the fact that I neither knew what I was doing wrong, or even the name of the action I was taking so I could find out how to fix my problem.  I'd say rather than assume so ego-driven dribble about the levels of implied respect or effort expended, just don't answer the question if you feel it's beneath the threshold of what you consider worth addressing.  
Then show it in 'your'  post. Oftentimes there are posts that say "compiler gives me NullReference exception" with just some pasted code. That looks lazy, and it is likely to be downvoted and ignored. The same issue with "hey, it keeps giving me NullReference exception on line x. I tried to do x and y, but I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong since it keeps popping up. I thought that exception means yaddayadda, do I understand that correctly?" will most like get an answer. Its not so much the actual problem, but the communication surrounding it that makes the difference. People who address others as human beings instead of addressing others like a fuzzy-Google-bot are way more likely to get an answer.  
I suppose it comes down to a difference in priorities.  I personally operate under the assumption that the person asking the question has already tried whatever they could think of anf that a dearth of explanations and walls of text outlining their struggle is not necessarily equal to a dearth of effort on their end.  And more over, I'm not in the business of disciplining people for not working hard enough or commiting an implicit affront to the effort I invested by not showing me receipts of their blood, sweat, and tears.  If they choose to be lazy in their learning, that'll be a punishment onto itself when they blossom into underdeveloped developers. Most importantly, I legitimately think anyone who's lazy would be more incentivized to google if they could/knew what to Google.  It gives you an instant answer and you don't have to deal with a bunch of tech bros moralizing to you.  Only a masochist would make dealing with redditors their "easy" way out.  
 Oftentimes there are posts that say "compiler gives me NullReference exception" with just some pasted code.  There are a lot of questions that I wish gave even that much detail. Hang around the new queue long enough and you see a ton of questions that are just a block of code and "it doesn't work why". And then when you ask them what they mean, they just repeat "I don't know it just doesn't work". Like, you wouldn't call a general contractor out to your house and then tell them "the house is broken, fix please". Come on, help us help you. Or alternatively, asking "why am I getting this error" but not posting the code, or even the complete error message, or even the language. And then refusing to clarify when asked. It's easy to get jaded by posts like that.  
 Its not so much the actual problem, but the communication surrounding it that makes the difference. People who address others as human beings instead of addressing others like a fuzzy-Google-bot are way more likely to get an answer.  "Funnily enough", similar behaviour in modding games (like FO4). Put no effort into solving your own problems, and people will rarely come out of the woodwork to assist you. Same question, re-framed and listing a few things that have been tried, is far more likely to be answered.  
Sometimes people can literally Google the words they use in their posts, in which case they've proved themselves capable of being able to find the words to search for  
[deleted]  
But if you tell them how to find an answer you‚Äôre treated like a bad person not willing to help  
Anyone can Google, but often people are looking for more context than just a literal answer  
Come on guys!! This isn't stackoverflow. Take your douche complex over there  
I remember posting here one time and getting SLAMMED for my formatting, and although my code was intermediate and I am self taught this was the only thing that people commented about. They didn‚Äôt even answer my question, just destroyed me bc of my lack of formal experience with standard formatting. Really discouraging I haven‚Äôt posted since  
I can't find a post in your history, did you delete it? Can you be more specific other than "slammed" and "destroyed"?  Formatting is critical to being able to read and understand something, and if it's python, the formatting is actually part of the program structure.  For the most part, unformatted posts will get a simple request to read the posting guidelines and format your code so it's legible.  
They should have at least helped you with what was wrong with your code while also giving friendly advice about the coding format/style. I didn't know there are lots of people who are nitpicky about the coding format or style.  
To paraphrase the comment section, it was basically like ‚Äòre-format and then we will Help ‚Äò  
I knew it. So re-format and stop complaining. I've experienced it to. Guess what, I re-formatted and got a BUNCH of help. They don't have to help you, they are literally volunteering  
I get this snobby feeling in all programming forums. Mostly just snobby people who want to criticize everything and make themselves feel better or something. If somebody asks how to do some loop in python people will try to answer with the most complex looking but "beautiful" list comprehension example which in no way is helpful for the beginner. People just don't see what's relevant and what's not. Ignorance.  
I got a lot of backlash too in the comments for asking a question they deemed was easy, and was told to solve it myself. Little did they know i'm new to coding and tried googling/watching youtube videos for a solution.  It only motivates me to improve faster so I can help other users in this subreddit unlike those insecure people hahaha  
You got downvotes from pricks, there is no more. People in general, no only in this subredit like to feel superior to others, those ones, are absolutely cunts and very easy to identify in real life so you can stay away from them. They forgot, because they are empty heads, that one that they were beginners too. Apart from that not to much to say, when you have a problem try to analyze all the steps, then search for a very specific thing in Google, it will probably appear your answer . But is harder to find solutions for not specific things. If you cannot find it you can ask then in SO or here. In SO are promoting some policies to try to feel better to newcomers and if you downvote a new member you got an alert saying that you have to explain why are you downvoting. I really do not understand downvoting without giving an explanation of why. I just assume they are cunts, because probably they are.  Also keep in mind that learn what go search in Google take time, probably years, I've been coding since college 10 years ago, and I find that I am good searching in Google the last year or so. (Like find the answer in the first link) Edit: forgot to say, when you post, put always your code, what you tried to achieve the end result and the different wrong results/errors you are getting.  
I get banned in stack-overflow because when I started programming I‚Äôm asked stupid questions.  
reddequite... what a concept. certainly wishful to ever think it would ever become widespread.  
It's sad that I laughed at the title of this post. Years ago, I learned from my very first post not to ever ask for help in this sub. As a matter of fact, why am I even still subbed to this sub?  
downvoting is a thing?  
Your last 3 posts have positive votes, so I'm not sure what downvotes you were seeing.  
Welcome to the internet.  
Yeah, fuck fostering a helpful atmosphere in a programming help forum  
More like fuck trying to control what you can't control and focus on what you can. You cannot control the actions of another. You can control your own actions. If I see a question I can answer, I answer it. I'm not going to feel some kind of way because someone else does not answer it.  
Except we can have an effect on the civility of the community.  If someone's being a condescending dickhead to someone asking newbie questions then they should be downvoted and called out on their bullshit.  If we don't, this place becomes a shit hole like StackOverflow.  
You can feel like you do sure. Karma systems are great for getting users to feel like they have a voice. If someone doesn't care to be civil, why do you think they would care about being downvoted? Instead of trying to change how other people behave, your time would be much better spent controlling your reaction to such people.  
Maybe stop looking at downvotes as some kind of measure of worthiness.  The majority of posts in this sub get only a handful of votes anyway.  Did you get the help you needed in the comments? If so, what do you care how many votes the post got? Edit: There's no shortage of irony that in a thread asking people not to downvote, my comment is downvoted.  Never change, Reddit.  
Not op but if posts have 0 or minus votes they are less likely to been seen. Which obviously means less chance of being answered.  
The people who answer questions here regularly browse by new. Upvotes or downvotes aren't going to make any difference on whether a question is answered.  
More down votes makes it harder to see, which in turn makes it harder to get help. So caring about down votes here is perfectly understandable.  
I mean, I typically look at downvoted comments out of curiosity and typically skim other comments so...  
Post is different from comment.  
Okay? Almost no one else does.  
That's patently false. Comments get hidden after a threshold of single digit numbers. You think downvoted comments get MASSIVELY downvoted by accident?  Everyone looks at downvoted comments.  
Internet/Reddit points do not matter to me. It's the voting algorithm that can silence someone asking for help, which can lead to 0 replies or help from anyone.  
Locking as this is generating quite a few arguments.  
or when they're trying to help and the solution doesn't work. That doesn't help it just makes me not want to help you anymore.  
Maybe try to take CS50 and head over there. Prof David Malan will come to hold your hands and walk through your code.  
How about you just stop caring so much about worthless reddit points?  
I don't care about reddit points. Problem is that Reddit's voting system will make downvoted posts just die and get little to no exposure, which doesn't help those who ask for help.  
Most of the people who regularly answer questions sort by new, so they see posts regardless of the votes.  
Imagine caring about downvotes on reddit  
This would be awesome, I would print them out and have them in my office.  
Same here! I'm looking forward to this one redditor's coloring book too  
Welp, there's a mandatory purchase. Thanks for the heads up!  
What is so good about it? Im on mobile but it is only a signup page and im not giving my email when I havent seen a product.  Ironic that someone making a coding book has a trash mobile site.  
Hi! Yea the sign up page is pretty bare. I basically threw it together because people were asking for a way to get notified. The basic idea is a coloring book full of data structures and algorithms examples where you color in nodes/objects/indices and pointers/edges/arrows step by step. This helped me a ton when interviewing because of the visual reinforcement, and I wanted to share the study technique. Right now I'm working on sample coloring pages to send out to the mailing list to get some early feedback. Once I have a better idea of what people  really want, I'll put up a better landing page. Let me know what you think.  Cheers!  
Huh? It's just a sign up page where you can enter your email if you want to be notified about it. Also the page loads and works fine for me, not sure why you're saying it's badly coded?  
No prob!  
Where can I learn about this coloring book? A thread you can reference to?  
Yea it was a post in cscareerquestions here

Hahah dude, he just released the first one, look here: https://medium.com/@tangert/sudotoons-print-vs-return-90bc5e97eb62 What are your thoughts on that? It's not even a cartoon, just blog post with awful art in it. I bet you don't want to waste your printer's ink on that :D  
I tried to do something like this for a while with short youtube videos.  
"It's important to have some idea of how to build an efficient autocomplete, not because is functionally usefule, but because it's a common interview question."  Fantastic.  
Wow these are great videos! Thanks for sharing  
Just watched all the videos, well done!  
I gotta say that was beautiful to watch. I love the fact that it is not just educational it also has a good deal of humor into it. Hope you keep making videos.   
Muy bueno  
Thank you! I saved it!!  
Did you ever continue making the list about watching TNG for the first time?  It's hilarious, and right up my alley.  
I didn't amass a lot more content for it, aside from wishing death on teenage Wil Wheaton several more times and developing a serious crush on Tasha Yar, then being sad that they wrote her out of the show.  
!RemindMe  
Boy, as someone studying to be a software developer, I've noticed there is a massive lack of visuals for some of the core concepts. This is really annoying if you're someone who learns by seeing. Plus, why not add some humor to learning? For me, when it's funny it sticks more quickly in my brain.  Also, younger students are getting into programming (think elementary school) , and you could reach a large demographic by creating a series that's fun and informative.   
But scratch for kids has the cute little animations and such. Hoping to get my daughter on this once her reading is better  
Check out the games on iOS too, including Lightbot and SpriteBox. You'll be surprised how much fun it is to learn simple concepts like loops and such, even for adults.  
Scratch, Alice and Lego Mindstorms all have similar programming languages, if I recall, all utilizing drag-and-drop programming. Harvard's CS50 uses Scratch in their first week just to get people introduced to programming concepts.  And I'm going through a course that teaches Alice.  They help you visualize how all the little parts fit together. Scratch I think would be great for a little girl with an interest in computers.  Alice is a bit more complex but like Scratch, really lets a new player see code in action.  From the context of your post I'm assuming your daughter is fairly young and I think Alice is geared more towards ~12 and older.  It and Scratch teach things like flow control and loops and the rest in a very visual and responsive manner that some people might not grasp as quickly by programming code in Sublime and launching it in a console.  
Another cool scratch-like program for learning is Apple's 'Playgrounds' app that comes with iPads. It's probably a bit more advanced than scratch but boy is it cool!  
Or get her better at reading now :)   
Ah why didn't he think of that!  
I know! It's such a simple a simple solution!  edit: /s   
Trust me I'm working on that  
It anyone is looking for more visual ways of learning CS concepts, I'm working on a coder's coloring book for data structures and algorithms!   
Signed up! Looking forward to those sample pages.   
Can you give some detail as to what this is? The site doesn't give any real information.  
Hi! Yea the sign up page is pretty bare. I basically threw it together because people were asking for a way to get notified. The basic idea is a coloring book full of data structures and algorithms examples where you color in nodes/objects/indices and pointers/edges/arrows step by step.  This helped me a ton when interviewing because of the visual reinforcement, and I wanted to share the study technique.  Right now I'm working on sample coloring pages to send out to the mailing list to get some early feedback. Once I have a better idea of what people  really want, I'll put up a better landing page. Let me know what you think.  Cheers!  
That sounds awesome! Definitely something I'd be interested in. I look forward to learning more about it.  
Agreed.  I'm intimidated by huge blocks of texts.  I like pictures.  And crayons. But seriously though, as I am also a visual learner, I prefer video tutorials and interactive things.  And pictures.  I get lost in the abstractions.  I get lost in the details.  Like binary trees for example, talk about them in text, and I get lost.  But I just watched Week 5 in Harvard's CS50, and saw them visually and they made perfect sense.  Actually, that same course also helped me resolve a few of my insecurities about pointers because the lecturer actually drew out how pointers and memory work, which helped the idea click. Pointers are such an arcane concept to a new programmer, but for visual learners like myself, actually seeing them in action, actually having a diagram for the stack and the heap really helps. This is true for many programming concepts, where I'd love to have some pictures rather than just some text.  
I'm exactly the same way - a long paragraph may as well be Egyptian hieroglyphics. After a few sentences of jargon, my brain simply refuses to latch on to the concepts.  When I study, I read a LOT of other people's code. Just seeing it implemented in one way helps me understand what's going on, but I can't help feel that a comic or an infographic would be more useful in the long run.  Btw, I'll have to check out the Harvard course, it sounds extremely helpful, thank you!   
CS50 is available on iTunes University or at edX for free.  They are long, about 90 minutes each, as they are actual Harvard lectures.  But they are highly informative. If you want to get a certificate out of it, you can actually do the course for $90, but I'm just watching the lectures right now.  
Thanks for the information!   
We remember best when emotion is involved in the learning process. Memory and emotion are two peas in a pod.   
Can we have a META in this sub. I've seen about a bagillion of these posts. "Would anyone like a tool to help them learn programming here in r/learnprogramming?". The response is always a resounding yes, and rarely leads to anything. Just make it. If it's good people will consume it and love you forever. People want good content in general, and in this sub they want good content about learning to program. So the real question is not if we want content, but if you, u/tangerto, can create good content. Show us what you've got.  
I would!  
The Grokking Algorithms Book is good for beginners or for those who want a fun refresher. Obviously not too much depth but teaches it in a nice illustrated way. Code is also available on github.  
Even if I think I understand these concepts, having something like this would still be nice to review for interviews and to bookmark for when I need to explain a concept to someone.  
That reminds me of this http://jvns.ca/zines/  
I would subscribe if you made these available on youtube.  
Would've helped a lot before j changed my major.   
Who is this j you speak of? Sounds like a jerk  
Lmao  
[deleted]  
Life has many doors, yes?  
There needs to be "University of GIFS and memes" where you learn entirely with GIFS and memes. That would be fun.  
4ChanTM Trump University  
Yes! Where do we follow!?  
If you could do one on recursion, you should do one on recursion.  
I'd love an ELI5 on Assembly lol  
Lol not my area of expertise I got a B- in that class hahahaha   
Lin Clark does something like this. Always a great way to have something explained. https://code-cartoons.com/  
Sounds like a cool idea! It will take some work to get the cartoon to both look good and express the ideas clearly and correctly. I designed/commissioned some cartoons and animations to teach Ruby on Rails concepts. You can check out the cartoons on my site Learneroo or see the animation on YouTube:  Rails MVC in 30 seconds,  Rails Forms videos. I'd still be interested in creating more content for my site but I haven't that much time to do that since I started a full time job (software engineer at Google). Still want to find some time one day, or maybe find people who'd like to contribute...  
Oh yeah for sure, that's one of my main concerns. I'm trying to abstract away a lot of the concepts and use real life scenarios as much as possible. I'm also still a student so while I think I have a pretty good grasp of the material, I'm going to have to do some digging/reading into making sure I don't fuck up people lol. Your site looks pretty cool‚Äì‚Äì perhaps we can collaborate on this to some degree. I'm working fulltime right now for IBM so this project will clearly have to be on the side, but I'm not planning for the illustrations to be terribly complex.   
What would be awesome is that you'll expand your understanding of the subject so much through trying to simplify it for others, you'll probably gain/learn from this more than the people watching your videos.  
Chiming in to chime in. Newer to the dev world as in the last 2.5 years or so. Started as a web designer, then I wanted to make the dev side exactly how I pictured it. Don't know if I can be of help, and I have some other big projects I'm working on, but I'd be happy to provide some design work or contribute as I can/if you need. Being a visual person/learner that lack of visual was one of the most frustrating parts of getting started in the dev world. I couldn't even find a damn flowchart!  
Would love some help or guidance, I'll contact you soon.  
Haha I don't know about guidance, but sounds great!  
Amazing idea! It's something I definitely would share with peers/buy/download  
Please!   
YES.  
I'd love to have one that's written out, I find it really annoying that most programming explanations are on YouTube. I find it easier to read an explanation, especially because then I can revisit parts of it easier.  
I have a manga guide to databases and a few others that I got because they looked cool and I hope my son will enjoy them one day. I would buy more and STEM needs more stuff like this for girls and boys. Would probably buy.  
Remember, even if you go open source, you can still run a print for people that want it and also to help yourself out for the time you spent.  
Yes, I'm going to make it open-source in the sense that I'll leave the list of topics open to everybody to edit  
Yep.  I'm still not sure about the difference between an API/Framework or a Library.  
An API is a collection of function signatures (e.g. int add(int, int)). It's the language with which you talk to a library. In C or C++ the API is specified in the header files, many other languages however don't really have separate files for the API and the API is basically just specified in the documentation. A library on the other side the actual implementation of those functions (e.g. int add(int x, int y) { return x + y; }). The term library can stand for the actual machine code files (.dll, .so) as well as for the source code (e.g. libjpeg.tar.gz). Multiple libraries can implement the same API (e.g. clang, gcc and Visual C++ have all their own implementation of the C++ standard library).  A framework on the other side is basically just a really fat library. Unlike a library that is focused on solving one task (e.g. libjpeg decode JPEG files, but provides no function to display them), a framework tries to solve all the tasks (e.g. QT can decode JPEGs, display them, talk to a database, build a GUI, browse the web, etc.). An application build with a framework would ideally only depend on the framework, while an application build out of individual libraries might end up depending on dozens of them. Frameworks can speed up the development quite a bit for that reason, but they have the disadvantage that you end up depending on them heavily. If you need to switch from framework X to framework Y, you have to rewrite large chunks of your application.  
PBS crash course  
Yes please. As a college student this may answer some questions that aren't addressed in my classes  
Sounds like a Patreon project.  
Oh that's a great idea...  
Lemme know when its ready for this noob  
I'd be willing to animate them if you need help.   
If it's really ELI5 and not over-complicated I'd def subscribe and follow a channel like that. Yesterday I typed into YouTube "what is jquery" and instead of getting a simple, 1-2 minute video explaining what it is all I got was tutorials on how to use jquery when all I wanted was a simple answer to what exactly it is.   
If you really want to know something like that, YouTube is definitely not your best bet. Google, StackOverflow or the actual jQuery website seem like much better choices.  
yes, this would be great  
yes please  
Go put in YouTube and you have yourself a deal  
Definitely yes please.  
I would love them!   
awesome idea!  
Please do!   
YES!

Yes.  
That would be amazing!  
That'd be awesome actually.   
I would need this haha  
That would be amazing. There is definitely room for this in the modern compSci world. Good idea!   
I'd love to see this!  
I would!   
yesyesyes

Please let us know when you do publish the book! As someone who dabbles occasionally it would be great to have everything in a single place!   
Yes, please! Analogies are useful when learning new concepts, or making them stick.  
You might enjoy Bubblesort.io. It's run by a software engineer, backed by a Kickstarter, and it has a good-sized following (though based on this post and reactions to it, not enough!) Comes out with more all the time. I see the person who runs it at tech conferences fairly often. There's plenty of room for everyone to share knowledge. Just thought you might like these, too.  
I've always had the idea of finding the best CS ElI5's on reddit and putting them in an organized archive/blog.  Maybe ill get around to doing that.  
I'd love that. Always wanted to get my siblings into computers.  
DRI and SOLID are some more acronyms to add. I also think a cheat sheet with Dynamic Static, Functional, Interpreted, Compiled,  etc would all be good.  
Like Schoolhouse Rock?  
Yesyesyesyesyesyesyes  
!no  
Where do I sign up?  
Where do I find out about this book?  would buy in a heartbeat if it's as described :)   
That will be great! As a cs student I can sure use that and learn a lot!  
Yes very much so!  
Would apreciate it  
yes, this would be great  
Are you Lin Clark? :-O  
nope, just a student bored on a sunday  
I would love this  
I think this is a great idea!  Sounds more than a bit better than sorting algorithms illustrated through traditional European dance: https://www.youtube.com/user/AlgoRythmics  
It would be much appreciated I think.  
RemindMe! 1 week  
Yes yes yes  
Would love this! If you go with an open source model, I¬¥d be down to translate it into Spanish and Portuguese   
Would love to see some system design concepts  
I think this is an awesome idea! I used to TA at Berkeley a few years ago and one of the professors was working on this initiative to illustrate CS concepts: http://csillustrated.berkeley.edu/  
People would like them very much  
Yes Please.  
Yes I would love this! But if it's going to be a comic it's got to be funny!  
Got some examples?  
Yes! We're looking for books like this at No Starch Press. Tech books that are worth buying. Please email me at bill@nostarch.com

Even tho I know this stuff it's very useful to read someone else's view. I'm currently through a vb.net book and the author explained something that I've known for a while and it just made more sense. So yes  
Please do! There's not enough material out there. Seriously do!  
This is a phenomenal idea, and I look forward to checking these out as they come!  
RemindMe! 12 hours  
definitely would upvote those

Are you a part of this lab?  
Sure. A good MVVM explanation earlier on in my life would have been a big help.  
I'd love a series on various design patterns and their benefits and short comings explained.   
Could you give a list of things in particular you want explained, or make a pull request to the list on GitHub?  
A good visual run down of Singleton, Factory, Abstract and so forth.  Basically OOP overall would be good.  
awesome, I'll add those to the list.   
I'd happily pay for this!  
Sounds like good fun - please continue progress with the project!  
I find drawn out representations are really good for learning from, I'd love something like this

I would love this SO much! Visuals are a lot easier for me to grasp and being able to see some very simple, basic reasoning regarding how particular Design Patterns work and why they're used would be amazing.  
I'm learning to program and would love to see something like this. I also work for a print shop in Ottawa, Canada so I'd be more than willing to produce a few hard copies for you and ship them your way.  
Amazing! I'll contact you in a bit.  
I opened a PR for some design pattern/principle things. I'm happy to help out.  
there's definitely some stuff on here that I'm not sure about so I'll ask for your help.  
Thanks for putting this whole thing together, I think it's a great idea.  
how did you make the svg example?  
Somebody else did. they forked it and uploaded  
Obviously this is well received, I'd recommend you create a landing page with an email lead capture so that you can keep us all updated and in the loop. I know I'd join immediately.

I gave it a whirl when it was originally posted, got stuck on the Regex exercises, and stopped it because I realized I should be working on projects to build my web dev portfolio for job applications. This course is great for becoming a wizard at Linux stuff, but it is super difficult for beginners in Linux.  
Are there any prerequisites for this course?  
Free time and interest.  
Thanks! Cause I am an amateur...  
For sure! EVERYONE starts at zero, best of luck on your journey, friend!  
You lost me at free time  
Just sacrifice some activities you do like browsing reddit, I don't like the no free time excuse.  
I got 4 kids.  Reddit don't come close to the time they take.

 Negotiating your way into the good desk location Swapping conference room chair with your desk chair Bypassing the VPN How to set game launchers to invisibile while working from home Never talking to the cute intern Choosing the right IDE font Finding easiest to own business casual clothes Finding the "private" bathroom Not committing suicide after your second 3% raise Making fun of front end developers OR making fun of back end developers   
You guys get 3%?! I would kill for 3%! I'm a retail worker though lol. Last raise was 1.2% :-(  
Good news! You didn't get a raise. 1.2% is less than the increase in cost of living/inflation. Which is usually around 2%-3%.  
Yeah, true. I won't even be getting that fake "raise" going forward. Now just 1% payout around the end of the year. I've hit a "maximum wage" that's been implemented. Time to put in even more work towards educating myself and improving my compsci knowlege. Been stuck in the nightmare of retail for waaaay too long lol.

It's just covering inflation, so if you looked for a raise at all - it's none.

Version control, debugging, and security in a single class? Where tf was this 4 years ago?!  
what about something similar to this but for people who don't have academic education about computer science? something to bridge the gap for a self-taught programmer?  
If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything  
which one do you recommend ?  
Not u/hadbleak, but TYCS is a more focused approach, instead of having hundreds of different sources like OSSU. IMHO TYCS is the best choice.  
okay, wish me luck on this new adventure!  
After looking at that list on the site it doesn't look like you need a CS background from a university. That's all just a bunch of tools people who use Linux use alot. For one the terminal is just an alternate way to navigate a operating system. VIM is just a text editor and tbh Visual Studio code blows almost every text editor out of the water.  
I still recommend everyone learning VIM, as much hate as it gets. I strongly disliked spending a week on it in class a while back, until I needed to make some small edits in a file on a server and didn‚Äôt need to download and reupload the file. I probably use VIM weekly now for small things. And the shortcuts carry over to other things like Jupyter and Colab notebooks.

[deleted]  
Holy shit. I started an internship and I needed learn git a bunch of this stuff that ISN‚ÄôT TAUGHT AT UNIVERSITY! Thank you for this post! I missed the original one.  
I admire MIT immensely for their continued support of providing free access to education to the masses.  
After graduating I have washed out of two software engineering jobs so far due to not having this knowledge and the impostor syndrome that lack of knowledge engendered.  This should be up there with data structures and algorithms in terms of pedagogical priority in my opinion.  
All your school should really have to do is post this syllabus where the sophomores are likely to find it. By senior year they will have googled the things on the list and added them to their skillsets, or realized they aren't that curious about the craft.  
Oh wow, you're so right, this field and degree aren't like other fields, it's a true calling, you either have, or you don't, all you need is to have the words mentioned to you and you should be kept awake nights in a fevered dream about you you must learn the newest framework, you need to know about all the different command line utilities, it's an absolute necessity for you to self actualize by satisfying your burning curiosity about everything CS, or else you simply don't have what it takes to make it in this elite field.   Get fucked. My university was very free and open in treating me like a customer when it came to paying the tuition, yet when I want something for my money it's a big fuck you, it's all on you, we're not here to hold your hand or do anything for you.  No, you bastards, I'm paying for this, tens of thousands of dollars for half-assed Power Point presentations, you get to treat me like a customer, then I get to treat you like a business and I expect something for my money.  What I got was substandard, I shouldn't have to be three or more standard deviations above the mean to make it, especially when these tools could be at least mentioned, pointed to, once, or hey, explained in terms of their relevance, or even a class on, at least a work shop, walked through a bit, something.  Nope.   If you think this stuff is obvious, then you probably don't realize to what extent your context and particular circumstance have front loaded a lot of concepts and ideas you happily take for granted.  Are you familiar with the term "curse of knowledge"?  
You'd last a month then I'd palm you of to IT. If you aren't curious about how to do things that sound interesting and improve your productivity, in a field where the entire process is using a thousand tools to turn your meat into a machine generator, then you should probably go into grocery restocking. And I get fucked just fine without the encouragement, thank you.  
I'm afraid the phrase "turn your meat into a machine generator" doesn't mean anything to me. If you want to turn this into something about me personally, about what you would do with me, which is clearly in some way a veiled self-congratulation, that's your business, but it's pretty boring and I won't spend time on it past my tongue in cheek attempt to take down the attitude I hear from so many big egos in this field with the above parody.  I'm trying to make larger point about the complexity of this field and, at least in my case, in my opinion, the failure of my institution of higher education to even breach the subject, much less address it.  Again, you want to belittle me for finding fault in this system, you want to suggest I will end up in grocery retailing (before getting my Computer Science and Engineering degree I worked in a number of different fields, in different countries, including education, oil and gas, driving large industrial equipment, I have a Class A CDL, I have welding certificates, I also worked in health care in a clinical pathology laboratory, and now I'm a software engineer at a Fortune 15 company, I won't need to bag groceries) instead of engaging with the topic at hand, that's fine, but useless except for your own praise.  Ultimately, what MIT is doing here is a great thing, much needed, something I would have benefited from, as would have others I know, and I wanted to call that out by referencing my own professional experience in this field.  Now, to further explore the topic:    If this field were one wherein there were some relatively small, fixed number of tools and technologies, which didn't change often, one where people were pretty much all in agreement about them and all pretty much needed them and used them in the same way, like say in welding or carpentry, then it is reasonable to expect people to learn them, perhaps all of them, and learn them well.   But the world of bits is different than the world of atoms, people can and do constantly churn out new tools and technologies and frameworks and different and incompatible versions of all of the above and that number simply grows without bound and can explode beyond anyone's ability to cope with it.  There are no natural limits to the number or degree of complexity of the tools in the world of bits, you somehow have to keep up.  No one can manage it, it's just that those who by luck and experience know which to focus on and which to ignore and they can be productive while those who don't are cast adrift in a sea of complexity without much indication of which way to go.   There are a few which don't change much and which are ubiquitous, like git, which are ones most people can get their hands around.  I think git is probably a case study for how tools should be used, but that's another discussion, basically what the community did right with git (want to talk about this? how git is good and what they did right and how much the field should emulate it?).  There are countless others which do not fit this description, the majority in fact.  Should the student spend their time learning Angular or AngularJS or React or Django or Flask or ASP.NET, which versions of those, JavaScript, TypeScript, ES6, which libraries like JQuery, RxJs, NgRs, etc., internals of the browsers, dev tools and console, redux devtools, etc., etc., etc.?  This is just a small set of examples from a fairly approachable portion of this field, front end web development.   Where does it end?  Who is the final authority to say, "spend your resources on learning these, not these"?  Who has the answer?  Where's the committee?  The licensing board?  The standards organization  Nowhere, nonexistent (yes, there are some ISO standards for cryptography and lower level stuff, but no one thinking about reigning in complexity).  For a field which holds the concept and methodology of abstraction in such high regard, we really do a poor job of actually putting it to use in dealing with complexity.   And to my initial point, if there were any, even just pseudo-authority, I would think academia would be the place where we could come to a consensus about what people should learn.  As a customer I would expect when I spend tens of thousands of dollars on an education of just this question of what to learn, what to prioritize, etc., I would get an answer, instead in practice I didn't even know the issue existed, I didn't even know that there was a huge deluge of tools and technologies out there, more being developed by the minute, and that there is a whole skill set just to navigate them.   It's a real problem in this field, we're still in the early days, this complexity hasn't really exploded yet, but I expect it to eventually, and we will find ourselves in a situation like those in the Dark Ages after the collapse of the Roman Empire, picking through the ruins, trying fathom what these forgotten symbols could possibly stand for, all roads to documentation and explanation leading to 404.  
 1/15: Editors (Vim)  NOT. BIASED. AT. ALL. Please note that I am a vim die-hard but this is kind of crazy. I'm one of the very few developers that knows Vim. Most developers don't use vim (crazy, I know right!)  
Counter argument: as a security professional that spends lots of time on remote machines via ssh, vim is my best friend and knowing how to use it is actually a very powerful tool. When I was a developer it would have never been my choice, but I guess it's a case of "a tool for every trade, a trade for every tool".  
Why is vim better then nano?  
Not all distributions have nano but most will have vim  
I'm sure this is a stupid question, but can't you just apt-get nano ?  
I dunno why you're getting downvoted, unless people assume you're asking in bad faith. Vim is much, much more powerful than nano and is much better suited to development.  
Yeah Vi is the thing to know, not better but it's everywhere  
The shortcuts carry over to other things too like Jupyter and Colab notebooks (eg ‚Äòdd‚Äô to delete)  
I‚Äôm studying Computer Science; This is my last semester and I don‚Äôt even know what vim is, let alone using it..  
Don't worry about it! Vim is quite cool once you get the hang of it  
I've got bad habits of hitting ctrl-z or backspace or using the numpad which messed me up pretty good while trying to use vim.  
I learned Vim in the 90s, but Emacs in the 80s...  I really didn‚Äôt care for command mode.  
Just print out the a cheetsheet for vim. This is the one I used. http://www.viemu.com/a_vi_vim_graphical_cheat_sheet_tutorial.html I have it laminated.  
If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything  
I‚Äôm currently taking an Operating Systems course, so far we‚Äôve only learned some basic linux commands. And then the universities closed due to Coronavirus And on a side note, I live in a 3rd world country in the middle east. I don‚Äôt know about you  
It's pretty much the same here in the US(at least for my school). We've had some stuff where it was suggested that we use VIM when using the schools linux servers but we also had the option of just pushing everything through filezilla.  
Not all schools teach linux as part of their primary CS path. Some teach windows.  
I would be curious to know what major programs are letting their students into the job market without knowledge of the OS that accounts for 90% of every platform except desktops.  
Those are the bad ones.  
You‚Äôll figure it out pretty quick on the job if you use it.  
I love my emacs, but found vim on every Linux machine I needed so far. Basic vim knowledge (and there is no way you can cover more than that in one lesson) is essential for anyone who might need to touch a command line on Linux.  
It's also super convenient to know how to exit vim if you wind up running it  
Can confirm.  
How do they edit files when sshing into a server. Had to learn vim specifically for that  
As a dev I hope you aren't  regularly in the situation where you have to ssh into servers to hotfix things...  
At a university you normally ssh into a server so you can build things on that system, since it is more powerful. Also if something is processing you can turn your laptop off or put it to sleep and the server keeps on going. At least that's how I think most people use this. It is not used so you can "hotfix something in production." Having a GUI that you do everything from is a bit overrated, and a lot of them are poorly designed anyway. Text interfaces are more limited but more reliable as well.  
Yup that's exactly how we use it. There are some processes which take about 12 hours to run. Having to open the GUI everytime you make some file changes just takes too long  
It's not a prod server, usually just to build and setup things  
Piggybacking on this comment A lot of people here are arguing that vim is good to know when you are sshing into machines to edit files, and i agree. In case anyone uses emacs, or prefers it, you can use tramp to access files via ssh protocol directly from the local installation of emacs. It's a pretty sweet tool that supports tab completion as well.  
If you can learn this editor and how to use it well, then you can learn any editor. That's why it is taught in universities. No one needs to show you how to use Notepad++ for example.  
Self-taught programmer, since fifty years ago, with 45 or so in the business.... This is an outstanding idea.  Wish someone would have done it sooner. Seriously, I've tutored CS and programming students - In one place they started beginners off on C++ as their first language for f--k's sake - and believe that most programming courses are devised by people who do not know how to teach. So this is refreshing to say the least.  
50% of MIT curriculum is self taught. That's why it graduates some of the best engineers.  
Great resource. Thank you.  
I agree  
Yes, thank you.  
That's honestly pretty weird. I am studying at a very low ranked uni in the UK, yet we have covered all of these topics in the 1st and 2nd year. It could be because my course is accredited, but I'm surprised a lot of universities don't teach Shell commands or Version Control (Git).  
The site mentions machine learning as something people probably learned about, I‚Äôm about to finish my degree in CS and I never had a course in my program specifically about machine learning, should I be concerned? Any suggestions for online resources to educate myself more about it?  
No, machine learning is still a young field. I've never taken a class on it however my senior project this semester will have a machine learning component.  
Machine learning isn‚Äôt a young field, but it is a very specialized one. Most software engineers will probably never need to know anything about it  
Yeah. By young I meant more in the sense of it's practical applications becoming accessible to almost anyone willing to learn, it would be too specialized for a mandatory curriculum for CS and would be better for a elective.  
This brings back memories.  
This semester is the missing semester of my cs education thanks to covid  
Wish I had a more extensive CS curriculum, feels like i'm learning everything from scratch now  
This isn‚Äôt really CS, it‚Äôs more of tooling used in SWE jobs.  
This looks promising, thanks  
Thanks for the link!  
is there a part in the course about overcoming being antisocial or how to communicate verbally?  
NICE  
Well, I know what I'm going to be doing  
Awesome  
Thought this was a corona virus joke tbh.  
Leaving a comment to visit later. This is invaluable.  
I spent the last week working on a metaprogramming project and was just marveling at the fact nobody tried to teach it to me in school. I might check this out just to see what they say about it! I really believe that more polished and accessible tools for codemodding would change the industry.  
Also check out this book - https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook/ - it has a similar intent  
much of these topics were covered in my intro to computer science class.  
Whoa!  
MIT is literally not better than any other university in the world. Outdated, outperformed and these topics you guys celebrate are basically subjects that were taught in 2nd semester at my former university.  
Op fucks  
Nivd  
It's a bunch of shit you should have learned if you worked at all in your field during college.  I went to Podunk university with a pretty crappy CS program and my friend group knew all this stuff because we all worked in IT and did internships.  
That's how I learned it, too -- but not everybody is lucky enough to get internships. It was kind of shocking to me when I realized how much of the job was just... out of scope for my CS curriculum, because it was technically not CS. Acknowledging that and trying to work it in is a huge step up IMO.  
Neat. Commenting because I can‚Äôt figure out how to save on mobile.  
Wait until you use vim laughs overly maniacally  
Wait until you try to exit vim  
class Thing{ ... }wqwqwqqqwqqwqqqwq FUCK  
My professor required that we use Vim during Unix System Administration. I already know how to use it.

Good Guy Al: Writes an awesome introductory book on applied programming / python. Gives it away and even spoon feeds it to you for free.  
Some Beggars: "it's not enough, give me more" probably  
Really the only way for me to learn is for someone to stand behind me and say do this do that and explains 'this is why'  
And hits you when you do something wrong, amirite?  
Or when I do something right :D  
Seriously. I have sent this course to so many people. They keep asking me how I learnt to code. And they say they want to learn. But they never follow through. You can take a horse to a pond but you can't make it drink.  
r/choosingbeggars  
The only thing more tiresome than people complaining about free stuff, is people making up people to complain about.  
When you are always on the fence about learning how to code and homie hooks you up for free so you can jump on his side of the fence  
The first hit is always free.  Next thing you know is you're scouring the internet for courses on Pascal, Fortran or machine code and selling your grandmother to get your fix.  
"Hey kid, I got some nice algorithms. Wanna try some recursion?" "I... I won't get addicted, will I?" "Nah, kid, you can stop anytime you like."  
There is no recursion!  
sweet merciful mimba-bajimba! it's the benevolent spreader of knowledge himself! thank you good sir. you're a good person!  
Aww gee, thanks.  
"Why am I building a scratches face calculator in sniff Assembly "  
It's true. Now no matter how deep you go some out there will be asking you get "closer to the metal", next thing you know your comparing  cpu instruction sets. You're to far gone at that point.  
P-99 is P90x for nerds.  
Lucky for me I already know Fortran. It was the first language I learned.  
[deleted]  
would this be useful to someone who never programmed in their life?  
Yes. You‚Äôre the target audience.  
I feel so targeted right now.  
Go for it!  
Stop targeting me!  
Yes, this course and book are for people with no previous programming experience.  
[deleted]  
Amazing how even dead people can take courses.  
Because he was revived. Believe it or not death is the goal of anyone born in the 90's  
Yep! It's very approachable and you'd be surprised how much time you can save with literally just a few lines of Python. Like I needed to make a file that was just the difference between two other files, huge pain in the ass orrrr 5 line Python program.  
Do you speak English? Do you have a computer? You are now the target audience.  
May I just be off topic one moment?   Thank you SO much for what you've done for this community!  Your book, and your dedication to Python and teaching Python are so inspirational.  I really appreciate you! ‚Äã Get this guys book!  Learn Python!  It will save you so much time!  It almost doesn't matter what your job or your hobby is, if you interface with a computer to do it, learning a little bit of Python can help you do it better!  
Haha, thanks! I'm really grateful to all the people who work on Python, and the folks behind the Creative Commons license which makes it easy to create share-friendly content. And also my editors, because I can't word good and want help me do other stuff good too.  
General question for you - I‚Äôm a big Python guy myself, but it isn‚Äôt without its issues & criticisms. What do you think the biggest issue for Python is in the foreseeable future? And further, what do you think reserves Python a spot at the ‚Äúbig kids‚Äù table?  
I mean, aside form Java and C/C++, Python is the most popular programming language. (Even bigger than JavaScript according to most charts, which suprised me.) Python is the top language in so many different fields (data science, web app backends, sys admin scripting, devops, etc.) The main places where Python hasn't broken into is gaming, embedded (though MicroPython is coming along nicely), mobile (though Kivy and Beeware are working on this) and the holy grail, web frontend (it'd be amazing to have Python in mainstream browsers). I don't see a lot of existential threats for Python right now. Like, I'd put money on C/C++ being replaced by Rust/Go and Java replaced by Kotlin eventually. But nothing's on the horizon that could compete with Python. Like, the biggest threat to Python 2 and Python 3 are, well, Python 3 and Python 2. That migration was really tough, but Python 3 has been rolled out in more places than people realize.  
I just want to thank you for the amazing content you are doing. I recently started teaching kids computer science and python, and learning more abou it myself, still a beginner. I am definitely going to use your stuff with them, thank you for all the help! I also signed up for your course, looking forward to it. Now, you mention a rough transition from 2 to 3. I am just learning and teaching 3. Would you say that's ok, or should I make sure to learn 2 as well?  
 the holy grail, web frontend (it'd be amazing to have Python in mainstream browsers).   It would, indeed, be perfect to have Mainstream Python in the Holy Grail  
This is amazing for those who are not able to afford this kind of thing. Thank you very much for sharing your knowledge in this way.

Thank you. I and all the HOt Local Singles In Your Area really appreciate hearing that.  
You the MVP  
:D  
That's very generous of you Sir! Thank you! Appreciate it greatly!  
:D  
Al I'm a big fan. About halfway through the course currently.  Quick question: What resources would you use after the course is completed to take my python knowledge further? Any certain types of OOP projects you would recommend or courses? My main goal is to use python for technical interviews, so any input to further my knowledge to get there is really appreciated!  
Create a lot of scripts, or go on to Flask development.  Some good books are Effective Python and Python Cookbook, but these are useless if you're not creating things.  
What a treat! Thank you Al!  
:)  
Enrolled. Thank you for your generosity.  
:)  
I love you for this!  Will definitely get into Python down the line!  
Awesome!  
[deleted]  
Python is way easier than c++. If you already know c++ then you'll know how to use Python.  
Thanks bro. Looks cool  
awesome! enrolled, thank you!  
Amazing!! Thanks so much :D  
This is amazing for those who are not able to afford this kind of thing. Thank you very much for sharing your knowledge in this way.  
You are awesome. I saw this post while I was actually reading through your bookException Handling  
thank you! since you are here, I have done some extensive Ruby training, would you consider Python an easy transition?  
I just finished going through this book with a bunch of Ruby pros. There are plenty of similarities, and they didn't have any issue picking it up  
As someone who's main language is Ruby, python is quite an easy transition. Many of the things he shows you in his book can also be done for ruby and I use it for automation often.  
You are Awesome!!!! THANK YOU!  
:D  
Thank you so much for this. Really looking forward to it!  
:)  
You're the king!  
Thank you so much. Definitely taking advantage of this. Well worth the effort.  
Do the mit course on Edx if u have never programmed before  
Much appreciated.  
Perfect timing - I cannot thank you enough!  
Thanks a lot! I was thinking about checking out the book but this is perfect timing  
You‚Äôre awesome! Thank you!  
Thanks papi  
Thanks very much  
Very generous. Thank you!  
Things I need to do when I get home  
Thanks!  
Absolute legend thanks for this  
Big thanks :)  I'm doing the MIT 6.00.1x program (intro to CS with Python) and your books were part of the recommended reading. Will give them a shot as well!  
You're a hero, Al!  
Thank you for this!  
Thank You!!  
Thank you so much! This is very timely for me. :)  
Absolutely amazing! Thank you very much, good sir!  
Love this book! It started my journey with scripting and my love of Python and programming.  
I've been looking into web scraping and haven't found a tutorial I like yet. So this will help a lot thank you do much! You literally inspire me, I want to be able to do something like this. Write something like this for programming or circuits, and share it for free and not worry about making money. Just honestly trying to help people learn something new and better themselves.  
I highly recommend using a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license. (The non-commercial aspect is actually important, because otherwise people will take your work and start selling it instead of distributing it for free. You can always grant specific organizations permission for commercial use later.)  
I haven't really done a WHOLE WHOLE lot of coding but will this be useful getting into back-end dev with python? ‚Äã I'm sure at-least the beginning bits will be.  
Thanks!  
:D  
Hey! I just bought your book and I wanted to tell you thanks! The stuff in this book is so much fun to learn and I'm having a blast with it so far! Looking forward to the course!  
Thanks!  
Thank you so much for letting us know about this, now if only I was smart.  
I say this in all seriousness: smart is overrated. More useful is the ability to sit down and focus on learning some material for several hours at a time. I feel like I could do that easier when I was younger (and before the internet had social media to destroy my attention span).  
Curiosity and passion outweigh 'intelligence' any day of the week. The smartest person on Earth will struggle with basic html if they've got no interest in it. Besides, taking a little longer to learn something generally means you learn it well.  
A lot of their Python courses are 95% off for the next few days. I'm not too familiar with Udemy. Are sales like this common? I'm interested in learning more Python, but I don't want to go spending $50 on like 5 courses just to take advantage of these deals, and then end up not finishing them and finding the same sale 3 months from now.

Cheers Al. I've been automating things at work and at home thanks to you!  
Excellent!!! Thank you so much.  
Added this, will definitely be using it!    That said, can anyone recommend a good java learning suite that is also free?  
Link down?  
many thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I think summer is the time to tinkle with some boring stuff that I wanna automate ü•¥  
Sorry to ask, but will there be any other chance to get this course for free or on discount?  
Thanks a lot!!  
Signed up last time it was free üòä one of these days I'm gonna actually finish it  
Thanks Al! You‚Äôre awesome and we appreciate you!  
Thank youuuuu!!!  
fantastic! thanks, no more excuse to postpone now!  
You‚Äôre amazing. Thank you sir.  
Thank you!  
Logged in to get it, said already purchased. Now to find the time to learn it! Adding to my long list. Thanks for your hard work!  
This post just reminded me I have this exact book out on loan from my local library right now and it‚Äôs due back tomorrow. Time to extend it again. What a strange experience. Thanks Al üëç  
This is friggin rad as hell! Thank you for this and especially for giving it away.  
Some very useful stuff. Thanks a lot, Al.  
Is this a good thing to start with for someone who never have coded, but wanna get into Python?  
Thanks my man. You've really helped a lot with this free course. Now I think I'm closer to my dreams  
Thanks!  
I‚Äôve actually bought the book some months ago, so I may just take this free course opportunity  
Thank you so much for this ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I was just thinking today about this book and how I wanted to begin my journey of learning python for my work.  
You‚Äôre a cool human.  
Just got it. For some reason it went from 100% to 80% off at checkout but I‚Äôm glad to support! Look forward to learning.  
This is awesome! Thanks!  
Thank you very much.  
Thank you!!  
Bought your book to use as practical guide. Haven't started yet but thanks for the course online to follow along.  
Thank you very much for this! It‚Äôs very useful and also generous of you to provide a chance to learn it for free.  
Thank you so much! I‚Äôll try my best to improve!  
Thank you so much, been on the fence about learning to code,m.  
Thanks! I bought your book, but only managed to get about halfway though and use it for a few practical things before I had to put it down, hopefully this encourages me to get back into it.  
Wow. Thank you so much for doing this. Just bought the book so this course will come in real handy.  Cheers!  
Thanks! :)  
Thank you so much!!!!  
I actually got your book from the library this week, I was planning to start it "soon" but I guess I have no excuse now! Thank you so much!  
So what would be some practical uses for this? He mentions things like forms at work, what else?  
/u/AlSweigart , thanks for providing this resource! I recently bought your book and I think being able to follow the book with some (gentle) hand-holding from the videos will help me overcome my fear of learning to code/learn python.  
Thank you!  
Thank you!  
Thank you for this!  
I wanted to learn Python for ML and data science, so is this course for me ?  
I've been daydreaming about taking another wack at programing (got 1/4 of a way through a comp sci degree years ago) lately! This is so serendipitous. Thanks!  
Thanks! And yeah, if anything, programming is way easier now than it was 10 or 20 years ago. Good luck!  
I was just starting freeCodeCamps cirriculum today and got through the first basic HTML unit with plans to review and refine my notes tomorrow I want to learn Python but don't want to overwhelm myself so I was wondering is the sign up for this just to activate the class or how does it work? I'm really sorry if this is a stupid question I just want to learn but don't want to drop my progress in htnl after 1 day, hopefully I can return to this after the html and css portion is complete

Mate you just keep on giving, pure gems in this course.  
Thanks for this. You‚Äôre amazing!  
THANK YOU!! You wonderful,amazing person!  
Thanks Al, I plan on getting into python for synthetic biology and this looks like a great start.  
Thanks Al! I just finished the textbook a month ago and have already found it so helpful for the little bits of code I've been writing at work!  
Amazing, thank you. I just started reading the book yesterday.  
you're a hero my dood . love you. thank you very much  
I thought this was already free on youtube?  Is the content different?  
The first 15 of 50 videos are free on YouTube.  
50 videos?  OMG  
This is very generous of you, Al‚Äîthanks a bunch! I ordered a copy of the book as well :-)  
You are the Keanu Reeves of programming world.  
Just signed up for this course a couple of weeks ago and enjoying it.  
I just wanted to comment to say thank you for your book on creating games with python. After telling myself for the last ten years I want to learn programming, I started reading a few months ago and it's certainly started a passion of mine.  I'm currently working on a 'connect four' game with AI and I've found it challenging but an excellent exercise for anyone who has read your book. I will definitely be reading automate the boring stuff after.  
I am familiar with C and C++ and have been actively programming with java for months and I want to learn python for AI and Machine Learning. Is this course right for me? Thank you for providing quality courses for free OP !  
Had a course in Python which just used your book, so that was somewhat of a waste of money. Thanks for all the work you do helping the newbies like me out. While I still struggle with some concepts and names(what actually are classes or functions, how do they differ, that sort of stuff) it helped greatly on the practical side which is what you're going for.  
I was looking at this just 2 days ago and thought it would be cool, but not in the budget. Thank you so so much. One question I have though that you may be able to answer, is it possible to write macros to automate basic games, ie clicker style games? It's not for cheating, well sort of, but I want to optimize and automate universal paperclips. Just curious if it's possible  
You're a total geezer in every sense of the word. May you have a hundred years of cold pints, warm relationships and a sausage sandwich for breakfast every morning.  
As someone who has sat through countless government trainings, I‚Äôm gonna pass on this one.  
I dunno, some military training programs, maybe I'm thinking of A-School materials, that are ridiculously good.  I had a Navy vet as a physics professor and the textbook was his own, which was based off how he was taught math, calc and trig, in the Navy and it was amazing.  
He probably went to the Naval Academt which is a great college and not a training course  
The military seems to have the greatest disparity of competence of any organization I‚Äôve ever seen. Everything seems like it‚Äôs either super intelligent, highly trained people doing crazy impressive/difficult tasks equipment (things like: special forces, fighter pilots, or submarine crews), or total idiots who have no idea what they‚Äôre doing.  
ET A-School in the early 2000s was fucking torture  
Link? Title? Please?  
What is A-School materials?  
You should drop that link  
It‚Äôs actually a very solid training. I went through it on vacation last year for fun (I hate sand) and I‚Äôve recommended it to more than a few people wanting to learn python.  
Can anyone explain to me why they would teach a bad course to the NSA of all people. People are just being negative for no reason. Damn if you don't like the course don't learn it/ teach it.  
Anakin?  
Ah yes, government. It was probably created by the lowest bidder.  
You have a misunderstanding of the government procurement process. The cheapest bidder doesn't always win if they don't meet all the requirements. Let's say a project has 11 requirement and Company A places a bid for $100K but meet only 10.5 of the items. Company B is new in the space and meets all 11 and puts in a bid for $140K. Then we have Company C that's an industry expert with history in implementing all 11 items and has a bid for $150K. More often than not Company C will get the contract.  
This! Government procurement rarely leads to just "lowest bidder" winning. Bidding is highly bureaucratic with many requirements that are explicitly laid out in the bidding contracts. This is meant to bring up front accountability to the bidding process: lay out all requirements, find the best person for the job and then choose the lowest price, while being "fair". However, as any engineer knows, pre-determining the requirements for a project and team to implement that project is very difficult, which is why government project bids often pay too much or fail to accomplish their goals well.  
LOL I remember thinking the same at my former job, manager had to sit down and explain it to me  
Depends which government (hello, my Canadian governments). US one doesn't exactly have a reputation of being stringy, let alone for defense-related spending.  
Here in Aus the lack of relevant experience for people who are tasked with awarding government tenders seems to result in lowest price being awarded more often than not... Hell even in industry this seems to be the case.  
You forgot company D with great lobbyists and political donations that puts in a bid for 500k-1 million  
Hahah touche. That does happen but if it's an expensive enough contract worth fighting for, then Company B/C in my example will raise hell. Just look at what happened with the JEDI contract for example between Amazon/Oracle/Microsoft.  
Also if the company has a good reputation it supports their chances. If their CORs say they are great to work with that is very desirable.  Often these contracts also have flexibility to add responsibilities and task orders. If a contractor working in the org can staff the project they may get the task without a new contract being written and bid. Even then, very often a contract will go to a lower bidder who claims they can handle the work but then completely cannot hire any SWEs or other technical people for the budget and they look like ass. I bet that's happening wayyyy more these days when they have to complete with people who can work from home elsewhere and value that more than a low salary from a contractor.  
 Also if the company has a good reputation it supports their chances. If their CORs say they are great to work with that is very desirable.   Yup. That's how my company got most of our contracts.  Even then, very often a contract will go to a lower bidder who claims they can handle the work but then completely cannot hire any SWEs or other technical people for the budget and they look like ass. I bet that's happening wayyyy more these days when they have to complete with people who can work from home elsewhere and value that more than a low salary from a contractor.  Hah you're absolutely right. Its indeed happening right now. Happened to one of our State clients recently. They went with a new vendor for a different project since that Director was only concerned about the money (despite being told by their own team not to go with that vendor). That project was in trouble 8 months in and we got brought in to fix the mess. And now it cost the clent more because of all the clean up (they literally had no input validations in most places of the application, and they had gone live with that system).  
You‚Äôre forgetting when Company D happens to be run by a senator‚Äôs nephew for $1.5 million.  
why wouldnt company b get it? they meet all the requirements and they are cheaper than company c. that sounds like company c will always get it kind of by default, that doesnt sound good in the long term. thats ignoring all the corruption, nepotism, etc thats common in goverment stuff too  
Risk factor. No one wants to take the bet on a new company that has no track record on delivery. This is why the big contractors tend to keep getting contracts. Directors/VPs/Execs can loose face and position with a single bad project so they are risk averse.  
Right - often times it goes to the highest bidder that will produce the worst/unfinished product. And then if for whatever reason the contract is cancelled, lets say it's for construction of a new building all supplies left over will be auctioned off at a fraction of the cost. I've seen this first hand - building was at 99% completion, government decided cost was too high. All they had left to do was a fiber drop and get the network up and running. I was hired in and found a large spool of fiber sitting in a warehouse along with several thousand dollars worth of networking equipment. I asked the higher ups what the process was to send it back and get a refund if they weren't going to use it. They just laughed and said it would be auctioned off because there was too much red tape to send it back. Even if it's not the lowest bidder you aren't guaranteed quality work. Government is stupid.  
More likely to go with company D, from which someone will get a cut from the price  
Harder to do that especially on the big contracts because the other bidders on the contract will go to court. The JEDI contract is a good example of what kind of mess can happen when you try to write a contract with clear favoritism.  
More often than not the minority-owned company will get the contract.  
That can happen on smaller contracts at the State/local government level but largely not a major consideration for large contracts. With that said, even larger contracts can and do have clauses sometimes which require say subcontractors to be from an MBE for example.  
As someone who writes technical RFP's occasionally, I can assure you that I have an idea of who I want to work with in the beginning, and the RFP is written in their favor without explicitly saying "Company X". Company X is almost never the lowest bidder, but the requirements are written in such a way that Company X is most likely to win, but to be fair they can still be beat, it's just not easy. The trick is that I legitimately want what's best for my org and do everything possible to be a good steward of public funds.  This process is incredibly easy to abuse though.  
Really glad for the next comment because this kind of flippant dismissal of government process is extremely dim-witted  and dangerous. A product of GOP propaganda since Reagan. not you in particular, just the whole arena of low information broad negative generalizations against  government. I know many people who work in the Park service, forest service, BLM, US geological survey, environmental protection agency, FEMA, VA, and they are all very bright and very hard-working. Believe me, you‚Äôre getting your moneys worth.  
RFPs are written so that the company the agency wants to win, wins.  
 RGPs can be are written  FTFY. Not every department/agency/government is horrible and led by corrupt or incompetent people. That being said, it's not trivial to accomplish this goal if the project is large enough.  
More like who has connections from the inside  
Or created internally. Or someone's favorite vendor. Or a former employee who's out now and running this under a lucrative contract. The possibilities are endless.  
 probably created by the lowest bidder  Oh, you mean just like how your mom and dad hooked up?  
So was Apollo 11.  
My uni gave me Coursera membership and it has "Programming for Everybody" by Michigan Uni and Charles Severance is good from the few initial classes I am watching.  
Lucky. Mine just put the links to his YouTube videos on our learning platform.  
I googled him and am taking the course on edX for free.  
If you want, you can "audit" for free courses in Coursera.  
You can find the paid courses online tho üòâ. Just need to do some finding. Which university?  
Local CC  
He's great, explains a lot of things from beginning, there is also a sense of humor.  
Is it the "Python for everyone" course? It is free at https://www.py4e.com/ I think  
Dr Chuck is da bomb. I did this specialization in 2020. I‚Äôm currently automating the shit out of a job with the knowledge I gained from there.  
When the opening line is: "So you're teaching the Python class. What have you gotten yourself into? You should probably take a few moments (or possibly a few days) to reconsider the life choices that have put you in this position", you're sweetly reminded that some people in the NSA still have a grasp of humanity.

I know you didn‚Äôt make this argument but I think it has to be said that ‚Äújust wanting to work on cool projects‚Äù doesn‚Äôt remove complicity when the projects hurt people. SWE‚Äôs who work at the NSA are enabling international privacy violations and using that data to hurt people in ways we don‚Äôt fully understand yet.  
You‚Äôre right but the issue is: when are you doing evil? And it‚Äôs often impossible to tell. If I work on a tool that gets used in a larger process and that process then gets used in an evil project, to what degree have I done evil? Like maybe I would‚Äôve said no to the evil project, but this tool can‚Äôt possibly cause harm as far as I can see, so I do the project because it‚Äôs my job and my kids need to eat.  
And that's how large ethical issues get broken down into small, tolerable bites.  
Evil is a matter of intent. If someone makes a gun for easier hunting, that's not an evil act. The evil act is taking that gun and using it to commit murder.  
I feel that at my current job. I thought that for the pay they were offering (60% more than my last role) I would be able to make peace with some personal objects I have about the industry I was joining, but no dice I still do.  
Well, I think it‚Äôs clear from your comment you know in your heart that using your skills for them makes you complicit at some level. This is each person‚Äôs cross to bear, but I bet you‚Äôll be much happier in the long run going somewhere else. I know I‚Äôm much happier at my current startup than I would‚Äôve been at Facebook, almost as well compensated (much better equity that I can trust and support), and feel so much better about my contributions.  
 SWE‚Äôs who work at the NSA are enabling international privacy violations  They are a DOD agency who is tasked with foreign espionage. That is literally their job.  
[deleted]  
Ah yes, surely you learned this firsthand from many years working in all the various agency organizations  
Nope, I entered the industry with convictions to not work at a harmful organization, and if I learn the organization is doing harm, to call it out publicly. It‚Äôs served me well so far since I just got a promotion to the mid six figures.  
Facebook hurts a tooonnnn of people. Don't see y'all crying about that  
Lol, then you're not paying much attention. Facebook is widely reviled here on reddit.  
Probably because this isn't a thread about Facebook, it's about learning materials from the NSA... Weird comment  
What do you mean? I actively speak out against engineers joining Facebook every chance I can. What you‚Äôd like is for your accusation to be true so that you don‚Äôt actually have to follow any hard convictions. I will though, don‚Äôt worry.  
Some of those ‚Äúcool projects‚Äù included spying on not only all Americans and many other foreign citizens, but spying on their exes like creeps  
Yep sounds like software engineers  
Engineers have an ethical responsibility and obligation to the public / humanity.   ‚Äú‚Ä¶I was just following orders‚Äù really doesn‚Äôt cut it  
Your boss tells you to spy on the suspected terrorist in the US. If you don't they might (or someone like them) bomb something. Refusing is allowing evil to happen but passively. Actively building a tool that allows the 3-letter agencies to track and spy might save lives (A good thing) but someone far up the chain of command might use that same tool, once developed to spy on an American citizen. If you pick up a garden shovel and beat your neighbor to death with it, that's that the fault of the guy who made the shovel. If you use my deer rifle to hunt homeless people instead of deer, that's not the fault of the rifle manufacturer. If you go to the library for a month to teach yourself how to make explosives and blow up a school, that's not a reason to close libraries down or burn books. All of those things are tools. They can be used to do good or evil.  And to be clear no one is "Building the whole spy network" themselves. Bob the engineer is being told "figure a way to break into this specific system" or whatever. He's not told why or how that tool will be used or IF it will be used. A tool chain of 100 software pieces is used to spy and build reports on people. And all of those tools were worked on by tens or hundreds of other people. To "avoid doing evil" in your viewpoint you have to allow a lot of evil to happen because you are doing nothing. The same tools that prevent evil from happening can be used to do evil. That's not on the engineer.   
thats a a strawman if you made algorithms and the nsa used them its one thing, working for them making the algorithms they want to use to spy on people is a different thing. you think the guys who work for things like isis but arent personally killing people have no responsibility at all? that logic is very dangerous, how many evil have you allowed to happen by not being in the most dangerous places in the world saving those people?  
Okay, give me a list of terrorists caught and privacy violation scandals committed by alphabet boys.  
The end justifies the means. Got it.  
The choice to work on "cool" projects that are evil is an evil decision. Facilitating evil is evil.  
Knives can be used to cut meat or to kill people. It is not evil to cut meat. It is evil to kill people. Intent is important. Evil is a point of view.  
And in that analogy, the NSA is the knife and is directing the knife to "kill people", doesn't change the evilness  
intent isnt everything. if you work making knives for Putin and he uses them to kill innocent people in Ukraine youre part of the problen. the intent is giving them those tools too, you cant ignore that if you make knives or algorithms on your own, for a university, a private company (clearly not like facebook to avoid whataboutisms), etc and they use them its different  
Cutting meat is absolutely as evil as killing people. It's murder in both cases, plain and simple.  
 I think a lot of the ‚Äúevil‚Äù decisions are likely made by politically motivated bureaucrats at the top.  sort of. If you've been in the beltway (DC) you've heard that CIA stands for Christians in Arms. All the 3-letter agencies recruit heavily from fundamentalists religions (Oh trust me I know how the tinfoil hat vibe feels as you read that) Arguments are made for "low drug use" etc, but the reality is the statistics are way out of whack. Why might someone recruit a person who just accepts what they are told to do, even "evil" stuff if they believe they are doing "the greater good?" Well that's obvious. https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/why-mormons-make-great-fbi-recruits  After the creation of the CIA , Christian missionaries played a very important role in destabilizing various countries and in carrying out espionage activities on behalf of the CIA.   the NSA is a bit different. They recruit first on merit and second on "passing clearance checks" as many of the analysis etc don't need to really operate at all in any area they don't want to. So while someone who speaks 5 languages at some college might get tapped on the shoulder, for the NSA if you wrote your own compiler or found a much more efficient way to compile with gcc, etc it's likely you get tapped and at least offered, at bare minimum from someplace like IBM or Booze Allen that does the contract work.   
The Mormons also have a giant castle right off the beltway.  
You literally made all of that up and if it had any basis in reality in the past it hasn't in decades  
Alas the temple is real‚Ä¶ https://wjla.com/news/local/maryland-mormon-temple-rededication-open-house-2022  
This is the same argument my friends who work in the defence industry use. "I just want to work on cool projects! I want to solve interesting problems! I want to overcome unique challenges!" It doesn't wash. You can work on cool projects without killing people or violating their basic human rights.  
There are plenty of cool projects that don't directly or obviously involve bringing harm to anyone. And, as we're in a python sub, it's also worth noting that individual pieces of a program are not always going to have an obvious end result. Even armed drones have systems that are perfectly mundane.  
 You can work on cool projects without killing people or violating their basic human rights.  It kind of goes both ways.  I'd wager that there are a lot of people in Ukraine happy that some Americans worked on "cool projects" that led to weapons systems they're using to defend their country.  
Mother fucker, you would probably be dead if we didn't have defense agencies lol.  I can always tell someone is ignorant when they think a country's defense agencies are useless and evil lol.  It's like a little kid talking about the grown up world.  Completely off the mark and naive.  
Cowardly edit. It's safe to assume that most of the projects worked on by the NSA aren't evil  
imo thats not that important. its not about what you are doing in particular its about who youre working for, like if you are a cook for evil institutions  
It's fucked, but I don't think it's morally worse than working for facebook/amazon/twitter.  
 Truthfully I think the majority of people at NSA are SWE nerds like us, that are just excited to work on cool projects. I think a lot of the ‚Äúevil‚Äù decisions are likely made by politically motivated bureaucrats at the top.  Yeah. They're just following orders. ... ... After Cambridge Analytica, police surveilling the social media of Black Lives Matter protesters, China use American-made facial recognition, and so, so many other examples, I have concluded that we don't write code. We choose sides.  
No, they aren't. They're simply evil people with evil intentions and know how to use certain tools, and wish to use it for evil. However, they want to do it legally (or at least, without facing punishment from the govenment). People who want to kill people join the military. Just watch the video that Assange leaked. They don't do it out of good will, because it's impossible for them to be this ignorant.  
Man those cooks sure are a bunch of killers alright and those military electricians are bloodthirsty  
I honestly think that's the reason they tried to keep it out of the public eye, because it's goofy and a bit lame, not because it contains super-secret NSA knowledge.  
More like most people are just incredibly ignorant of the NSA in general or any more secretive government agencies.   The NSA does a real substantial and necessary job for the United States.  
Ser rubber is not for consumption  
"necessary job" such as inciting military coupes all over Latin America to keep it under the control of the USA and the 1%  
That's the CIA.  
I'm curious -- what made him think that the NSA had its own Python training material, and wasn't just utilizing any of the other Python courses and guides? Maybe he saw it referenced somewhere and wanted to see what was inside, and figured it probably wasn't highly classified so it might be available via FOIA.  
Among other things, he's a crypto-analyst who's worked for the DoD.  
Ah, I could see him hearing about it that way.  
Like cryptographer or a NFT Andy?  
If you ever hear 'crypto-something' in the context of the DoD, it's safe to assume it's cryptography  
Honestly, I have no idea what I'm talking about. Here's his page: https://swenson.io/  
I‚Äôll ask my professor about him. She works in the NSA and does cryptanalysis  
Govt departments maintain a lot of documentation, of everything, even if it duplicates other sources. It‚Äôs useful if those other sources disappear, say like cobol documentation, which is still in use in a lot of financial systems including many used by government.  
[deleted]  
Is this the better route to go as opposed to Automate the Boring stuff or something like that?  
It depends. These docs are not going to show you how to make anything, they just document how individual stuff works. If you don't look at these items and come up with ideasfor projects, you're probably better off with Automate the Boring Stuff w/Python.  
That's a good take.  I'll keep both handy as I work my way through it. More information is not always a bad thing.  
u/Ysara which is better for beginners - Automate the Boring Stuff w/Python or Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw?  
Google teach yourself CS The best resource is called composing programs  
I am not familiar with Zed Shaw's course, so I have no idea. I have gone a little ways into Automate the Boring Stuff and while it does a good job of teaching you how to make non-trivial things with code, it is not going to prepare anyone for a job in industry by itself.  
If you're a beginner, stick with Automate the Boring Stuff or other courses. I vividly remember reading docs felt very alien to me as a beginner and didn't understand a thing. It only made sense later on once I gained more experience in programming in general.  
In general government training really is going to be "good enough for government work." As a junior analyst taking this class you would expect to learn a lot more from your teammates afterwards.  
Man, it would be really funny if there was a section on RNG and hashing libraries that had something like "note: do not use; we are aware of multiple undisclosed vulnerabilities in these libraries" or whatever  
Here is the table of contents for the lazy  
400 page printout seems like a bit of a "screw you" when it's a digital record.  
Is the course material good to learn from? Its not exactly the most readable version (cause its not pdf or whatever), but i'm interested to know if its actually good despite the format  
for dictionaries these are the list of countries as keys and the leaders we are monitoring as values.uae sorted to sort them by number of emails opened by NSA.  
 NSA Python  What were we all so scared about?  
I‚Äôll check it out and see how much can truly be completed in that 3 day workshop they mention. :)  
Is this material better or does it have an edge over the rest of the python resources and material already out on the internet?  
Do you need to be good at math to learn programming? I find it interesting to create things with technology, but frankly I can't even remember how to divide on paper..  
Not to learn programming, no. But to actually work, you need basic maths. Lots of programming doesn't use maths unless you're into videogames, statistics, machine learning, drivers and a bunch of other obvious stuff, but you may one day be surprised by having to code the eraser of a whiteboard on a canvas and suddenly you need to remember high school maths like y = ax+b and other geometry stuff. You can totally get away with just a high school degree.  
Big brain thinker right there.  
Wonder how good it is tho  
Why wonder?  
Because there exists an assload of already good learning materials online, easily accessible and verified by users everywhere.  Aside from the novelty aspect of this, every student should ask themselves if it's worth sinking their precious time into this material EDIT: don't mean to sound snarky, since I also wonder... But don't see the point in investigating this learning source unless there's some awesome value add I can't get anywhere else  
It takes 1 min to skim the table of contents‚Ä¶  
Yes, the golden indicator of quality ‚Äî the table of contents  
Compared to what?  
This is a super useful resource - thanks for posting!  
That's honestly very clever  
Can you give us a link rather than making us read a document about the link?  
OP did link it. https://archive.org/details/comp3321/page/n89/mode/2up/search/device  
Who doesn‚Äôt love a good FOIA request!  
Do they also have module for complete full-stack web development? üëÄ  
For all the websites the NSA runs? :P I'd be surprised if NSA.gov wasn't made by contractors even.  
Save  
Gross. No thank you  
We made a search engine to solve this exact problem. It shows the best path for how to learn any topic on Earth in a linear way. Here for example is the path to learning programming.  Or if for example you want to learn python, you can do it here.  Just search for what you want to learn. :) If you think there is a better way to learn the topic, just click on the ü¶Ñ and say it. I hope you like it.  
My God. You just solved a huge dilemma I've had for the past year or so. And also subsequently solved future dilemmas. I love you.  
I am really happy to hear that. I hope you will get value from this search. üíö  
Are you kidding me? This is far more valuable than you're taking credit for. For people like me who want to build something but don't know where to begin or are always getting conflicting suggestions from peers, this roadmap engine is saving the most valuable resource - time. Now, I don't have to deal with research, I can just begin learning what I want without being confused. Take some credit for the good work, man.  Moreover, I see so many other roadmap suggestions. I don't even know what some of those are. Is there a list somewhere of all the roadmaps?   
Your search engine seems great but I looked up "Aerospace engineering" and it just pulls up intro to flight, then rocket science. Just a bit of a leap there.  
Yeah you right, it is quite a leap. :) The cool thing is that all maps will soon be open source so anyone can change and contribute to them. For now you can propose to add any changes for it here.  
So it's the Wikipedia of learning?   
Yes, you can think of it like that. We only host links. No content like wiki. And the links can go anywhere. The focus is on linear and progressive learning, stating all the prerequisite knowledge that is needed to effectively learn the topics (will soon be added) and have all maps be curated and extended by community (also soon to be added).  
Question, just for my own learning. When you move it to open-source, how will you keep users from putting in bad (less efficient or just plain wrong) paths?  
There will be a review process with every change. If the resource is bad or is irrelevant, it won't be added. :)  
 Just a bit of a leap there.  You might say it's... (‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢) ( ‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢)>‚åê‚ñ†-‚ñ† (‚åê‚ñ†_‚ñ†)Ôªø ...one giant leap.  
I'm gonna bookmark the site to look at the paths every few weeks and never do anything like I always do   
That's really great!  I love the road map concept with places to immediately get traction.  Sharing this!  
This is really damn cool. Hope you patented it. I could see flowcharting learning procedures becoming a huge part of search engines.  
Uh... Ok i really have to check that out. Maybe itll help my shitty commitment to accounting. I do hope to get into coding enough to find work. Fuck being an office accountant.  
This is amazing!  
Thank you üíô  
wow dude stellar job. this is sick! thanks a bunch  
What the hell.. this is really cool!  
removed  
Sorry for that, we're working on fixing that too.   
 search engine  This is fantastic. You are a hero!  
Updooted and saved. You're a real bro.  
Amazing.   
This didn't work on moble for me. Had to go on my pc to see what it was about. But very cool  
this is best thing, you guys made everything super organised and a lot easier/simple to find ... seriouly guys heads off to you people  
Thank you. Most exciting thing is that its only the beginning. Once we ease up contribution, this will grow to cover any topic one may possibly want to learn about all connected in one open knowledge graph.  
That's going to a big relief for learners who don't know where to find stuff, going to help lot to coming up students... and I'm going to share this on possible platforms to rise.  
This is great   
I started learning on codeacademy, went to freecodecamp and then am now doing edX's CS50 (which is free). I recommend that anyone starting to code start by watching the first lecture of CS50. I didn't do this, but watching the first lecture got me really excited about coding even though I'd been doing it daily for 6 months and it also lays out concepts in a very easy-to-grasp way. It also introduces you to a program called Scratch, which was designed for elementary school kids and does an amazing job at teaching someone the basic structure of code.   
I also absolutely love and praise CS50. A lot of my friends in my CS class shit on Scratch because it's kid-like and "uncool" as they desire the hacker/cyberpunk aspects in learning CS (networking, Kali, wifi hacking etc.) and all that jazz, but I also see it Scratch as a really great way to dig into the concepts of building a program in any language, really.   
Is code academy a good way to start, or do you recommend doing cs50 first?  
I liked codeacademy for the interface and the way their course is set up -- it makes you feel like you're learning a lot and that you're progressing quickly. In retrospect it certainly wasn't a bad way to start, but I didn't know as much as I thought I did at the end of the Javascript class because it wasn't that challenging. I learned a lot of syntax but I didn't understand why the syntax is the way it is. I like CS50 because it breaks coding concepts down in an engaging way and gives a much broader overview of basic coding structure. The problem sets are the right amount of challenging. I recommend it over codeacadmy because learning why something is the way it is makes for a greater understanding.  Out of the methods I did, I would rec starting with cs50. Second would be codeacademy and third would be freecodecamp (to its credit, the FCC projects are great).   
I feel the same way about codeacademy, and I don't recommend them to anyone. You just don't learn. I'm sorry but it's the hard truth, using one syntax one time isn't going to teach you why it exists, why it works the way it does, and what can you do with it. FreeCodeCamp is just a hundred times better because they teach you the syntax, they teach you HOW to solve problems (read-search-ask style, the community they build, the forum for help on gitter which is fucking amazing). Their lessons are actually better (to me) as well, and they actually set you on a path for learning (first front end and/OOP/algorithms, then data visualization and then back end, with a lot of information on other stuff such as chrome developer), and you have projects which you can use to fixate that knowledge you've just got (and depending on how hard you go on those projects, you learn much much more). Unless you're paying for additional content + projects, codeacademy it's just a waste of time, and I don't know why spend money when there's such a good alternative. THAT BEING SAID, codeacademy is fine if you're just looking into learning a syntax for a new language.  
Yeah FCC's projects and algorithm challenges are great, but I think that the course itself doesn't do a great job teaching you the syntax as all the info you'd need to go through the stages of the syntax stuff is on the sidebar.  If for whatever reason you're new to coding and want to learn syntax (??? y tho) then I'd recommend doing the codeacadmy course then skipping to FCC projects/algorithms.  Also I think CodeAcademy is mostly free, or at least I paid $0 for it when I did it 9 months agoish.

Thanks, you're right that those are perfectly valid technologies for backend work.  However, my intention wasn't to be comprehensive in all possible languages for a given development field. Java, Scala, golang, Haskell, etc are all viable backend languages, but the greatest developer mindshare seems to be the ones I mentioned.  This is actually the problem with starting to learn coding that I was trying to address in the post.  Yes, these are my opinions and therefore they're not the only way to go forward. However, I wanted to cut through the clutter and suggest the 1-3 languages and resources to start with for a given field. These suggestions are based on what I see as the general consensus of what most people and companies are using for new projects.  Yep, I could be wrong (and probably am for some people), but I hope that for most people, the clarity I'm offering is more valuable.  
The general consensus varies from area to area. I'm on the east coast (North), and 90% of job listings are for C#/MVC I've literally never even seen a job posting (not that I've looked specifically) for Ruby/python web dev. I know one person working with JS on the back end, and everything else I see is PHP. Anyone starting with Python out here is going to be SOL for work You really should update the guide.  
Well shit, I just spent the last hour learning python.  
Still fun though. Check your local job listings before picking a language though, if you're serious. I'd say go a step further and contact a recruiting agency. They'd be more than happy to tell you what skills are in demand in your area.  
Python is huge for analytics right now in terms of big data, machine learning, medical research, etc.. Would not be my go-to for web development however. For that, I would start with HTML/CSS/JavaScript "front end" stuff in order to get basic understanding of how a website really works, and then you can branch out into the back end stuff and choose what approach seems best for you. I like JavaScript back end in general but Ruby on Rails is a great way to get moving fast. Oh - and don't forget to listen to Techno/Electronica while you code, it's one of the most important parts.  
That was fast!  
Yep, same for the UK and the majority of Europe. Ruby isn't widely used outside of the US from what I can tell. Areas with a high proportion of start ups will have a very different standard tech stack to the rest of the world and shouldn't be taken as representative.   
My local schools didn't teach and asp.net or mvc. Pretty much every job I've looked at says that they want you to know   
How to start? Right now, yes, right in this browser and in this tab, press Ctrl+Shift+J buttons and type     console.log("Hello World!"); This is it!

Shake it.   
https://jsbin.com https://codepen.io  
My first (and right now only) iOS app: a blue screen with text that says "hello world" made in Xcode.  
This is not a good place to start. As it lacks any context and any step further. It also doesn't explain why those fucking semicolons ";" are relevant.  Furthermore: console.log("Hello World!"); VM1005:1 Hello World! undefined   
Lmao agreed. Where do those fucking semicolons come from?  
I feel like the problem isn't starting, it's sticking with it.  
This is an interesting point. What do see in common in the people who stick with it? How do they stick with it? Will power only lasts so long.   
Great post dudebro  
Thanks!  
How can I tell if coding is not for me? I mean for web/software development, not only as hobby  
The simplest answer is if you don't like it. Why do something you dislike?   A more nuanced answer is that you may not like coding in a specific industry or type (mobile/front-end/back-end).   What I would suggest is to try it.  What makes you question whether it's for you?  
Well.. I'm not very good at maths. I had experience with C# and it was hard to learn for me. And yeah, sometimes it was tedious   
Don't get hung up on the math bit. Really. Most everyday development doesn't involve complex math.  What did you find difficult about C#?  
When tasks went more complex i just couldn't figure out the right algorithm and when i search for possible solutions on the web, sometimes i just don't understand the solution. That made me think bad about my abilities to code well. So i just wanted to know, should i just learn something else instead: like 3d modeling or something like graphical design may be  
Most coding isn't math. I end up doing a lot of math in code but that it because of my domain. I actually think coding is more closely related to philosophy than anything else. It's more related to reasoning through logic flows.  I will also go as far to say the majority of the software written does simple things in simple manners. Granted it might be glued together in a crappy obscure way. Which goes gets more into software design.   
Well, may be my problem is not about coding itself and more like language choice. May be i should try something else than just object oriented languages like C#  
are you good at solving problems or fixing things?  Are you good at critical thinking?  
Serious and a newbie question. Why php is hardly mentioned here? Isnt it good for a front and backend?  
That's a good question, especially because OP chose to mention Ruby. The industry is moving away from PHP but PHP is still pretty huge. If you're looking for a job you're far better off knowing PHP than Ruby. The most popular open source CMS are made using PHP (Wordpress and Drupal). Also, PHP isn't used for front end. PHP runs on the server, not in the browser.   
 Isnt it good for a front and backend?  A serious answer: Please be careful when listening to other people's opinions on software languages. Developers can be very opinionated and while many of those opinions are based on at least some sliver of truth, they can just as easily be completely wrong and send you the wrong way if you're still trying to learn. PHP is doing perfectly fine:  On any software language popularity/usage index, PHP is in the top 5 or top 10 (e.g. TIOBE, PYPL, StackOverflow survey 2016). With PHP7, PHP got some major performance increases that it really needed. PHP7 is now similar in performance to Facebook's HHVM. For enterprise solutions, use any of the major frameworks to build software with PHP and you'll be good to go. There will always be PHP jobs. A lot of people are still using PHP wrong and are not taking advantage of a lot of optimizations that can make PHP faster. This creates an opportunity for any motivated dev to learn about these tools and find clients for optimization. There are a lot of PHP devs who haven't even heard of opcache yet.  There are also downsides to PHP, but none that have an objectively good enough reason to outright reject it if it looks like a language you think you'll enjoy (and be able to use professionally eventually).  
Dude you don't even know how much you helped me. I really appreciate that. I will try to keep this type of work up for society by helping others in the community in whichever way I can.  Thank for help again.  Keep up the good work.   
Thank you. Really. You're comment made my day.  
You did the good work man. You put so much effort without any reason to make this community a better place and help many of here how are not good at coding. Therefore you deserve it Have a nice day Ciao.   
Is the link formatting messed up for anyone else? I see 50% of the links with the brackets and parenthesis   
You're right. Weird. The formatting looks okay when I edit it. I'll try to fix it.  
The best way is to just forget about learning a certain language or framework, its the concepts that matter. I've seen this touched upon a few times on this thread, and i want to clarify exactly what I mean by the term "concepts", and list some. The easiest way to describe a concept for me is by way of an analogy (Credit to which goes to my Boss). If you want to learn how to write a good story, you wouldn't particularly care about which language you learn, as the story would be the same independent of the language. Linking this to programming, a concept (in programming) would be an aspect of story writing that you can use in any story and any language, such as building dramatic tension or splitting it up into chapters. Most core programming concepts are 100% programming language independent and the sooner a dev appreciates this the better; whenever I hear something like "Oh i've only ever writting in language X so everything in language Y is totally foreign to me". In this scenario, its likely that the person stating this hasn't actually understood much of what they were writing, they just know how to do some things in some language. That felt a little ranty, but its something i'm passionate about, here some concepts that any new or otherwise developer should be understanding (in rough order of where to start, and roughly grouped together). Also as a note there's no use learning a concept if you don't know why you'd use it, so try to focus on how and why you might need to use and combine concepts to do something more complicated. Variables, (Simple) Types (e.g. numbers, booleans, strings), Operators, Statements vs Expressions, Order of Precedence, Keywords & Why Syntax is important. Static/dynamic/strong/weak/blah typing and why the type system that the language of your choice uses matters and how you can use it. Selection Statements: If Statement, Switch statement. === If you've got to this point and you can't point out where an expression is used in an If Statement and what type of expression it is, you've misunderstood something === Arrays/Lists Iteration Statements: while/do while statements, for loops By this point, you've hopefully gained an intuitive idea of how program flow works, for example you would be able to simulate how a block of code using selections statements/iteration statements would execute WITHOUT RUNNING IT, and at any given time you'll know what the next expression to be evaluated will be Methods/Functions, parameters, passing by value or reference, return values, scope By this point you've covered all of the core concepts that I can think of off the top of my head, there are likely much more. Once you've understood these start focusing on higher level concepts such as object oriented programming, functional programming. If you're learning a language that makes use of reference types (C#, Java etc) perhaps the most important thing to appreciate when learning higher level concepts is that THE VALUE OF A REFERENCE TYPE IS A REFERENCE. On the off chance anyone actually cares, I would suggest starting off screwing around learning all of the above concepts using C# and LINQPad. The expression mode is excellent for understanding the difference between a statement and an expression and it is incredibly lightweight so you can get cracking without having to screw around downloading a huge IDE just to write hello world and give up.  
Step 1: Pick a language out of the following     a.  Java     b.  Javascript     c.  Python     d.  C++     e.  C#     f.   HTML5 Step 2: Follow a tutorial for one of those languages, if you need help on that there's a wiki in the sidebar.  Start building with what you know CODE EVERY DAY (this is the most important thing) Step 3:  Get an idea and start to build, when you get stuck, google, refer back to your tutorial, search on here, stackoverflow, and other code sites for your specific language.  Never take someone's entire solution without understanding what every part of it does.   Step 4:  repeat step 3 a couple dozen times. Step 5.  Go apply for a job.   Now in Java: ArrayList <String> languageList = new ArrayList(); languageList.add("java"); languageList.add("javascript")' languageList.add("Python"); languageList.add("C++"); languageList.add("C#"); languageList.add("html5");  Random RN = new Random(); int randomInt = RN.nextInt()%languageList.length(); String userLanguageChoice = languageList.get(randomInt);  int userLevel = 1;  String userStatus = "noob"; while (userStatus.equals("noob")) {     if(userLevel < 50){          System.out.println("Study more to level up");          userLevel++; // this should probably be in an if statement      }    else{        userStatus = "noLongerNoobly";    } }  int projectsCompleted = 0; while(projectsCompleted < 50){    codeEveryDay();    workHard();    learnHowToSearch();    writeYourOwnCode();    repeat();    projectsCompleted++; }  Edit:  please note that the above was done by sight and without use of an IDE -- that may or may not compile -- will definitely need some imports and a class.  
Which of these is not like the other? a. Java b. JavaScript  c. Python d. C++ e. C# f. HTML 5 HTML 5 is a markup language. It's not Turing complete. That means the vast majority of the problems dealt with in the world of software engineering can't be solved with HTML 5. I'm not saying HTML 5 isn't useful, but I would never suggest it as a starting point. You're going to reap a lot more benefits mastering a programming language.   
Also, as hard as this is going to sound, if you know you really want to build applications and not do backend development, you need to get your feet wet in design as well. Design is hard and often an entirely separate set of skills from what you face as a developer. Developers are often trying to find how to perform integrations or model data for problems that have already been solved on the design or business front, or that are behind-the-scenes sort of things that exist almost purely as technical problems. When you want to build something other humans will find useful or interesting... well, you really need to decide if you want to "double" in both design and development, or separate your time between either or. Don't think becoming an expert in algorithms and programming languages will make building stuff, especially from scratch, all that much easier. Other than "not knowing how to start", "not knowing how to actually build something" is the #1 complaint I hear from developers, often from people that are almost done with their university programs.  
Hmm, I'm mostly interested in designing the user interface and experience, is there a point to learning Ruby for me?  I started with Ruby, because the code academy I'm applying to teaches it, along with Javascript. Will it hurt me to do both?  Other than JavaScript do I need to learn ux ui tools? Tools to quickly and visually mock up a design before I try to code it with javascript?   
[deleted]  
 HTML 5 is a markup language. It's not Turing complete.   Apparently if you include CSS then it is now: http://lemire.me/blog/2011/03/08/breaking-news-htmlcss-is-turing-complete/  
[deleted]  
I love building from scratch in C and I think it's awesome for learning the nuts and bolts of algorithms and data structures.  I don't know what to do with it though aside from little desktop apps that I have built using the Win32 API. It seems like all of programming that is really considered mainstream any more is web based stuff.   
Coding every day is the hardest part, hell that's the hardest part with learning anything - is sticking with it. I've tried on at least 4 separate occasions to teach myself to code, each time I fell off, and the worst part is it's not like I ever even hit a wall where I didn't understand what I was doing, I just... stopped.   
so ruby isn't a good place to start?  
Ruby is a great place to start. There is a great community and lots of good learning content online. If you do go with any of the back-end languages such as Ruby (there are a lot more back-end options than front end) you will still need to get proficiency in front-end at least to a degree. That means HTML CSS & Javascript. Ruby is very productive as a web development language and it's great for personal projects and getting things off the ground quickly.  
Good list! Perhaps add SQL as something to dabble in after they've gotten their feet wet with a more complex language?  I know SQL is not the new hotness but being able to normalize data and perform efficient queries really makes a difference when it comes to accessing data and creating good programs with it.  
On the line "int randomInt = RN.nextInt()%languageList.length();", why use modulo instead of just using .nextInt(languageList.length())? Is there any benefit to it?     
Same thing, I learned how to do random in C++ where that was the way to do it using srand()  (note it takes void -- http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/rand/ ).  I suppose it's more of a language-agnostic way.    
What would you recommend for someone who has some basic programming background (html) and understands basic programming logic and wants to create small indie games for Windows. Would it still be C#? Think like Stardew Valley, Prison Architect, Factorio, type of games.  
HTML isn't really programming. Do you have experience in any other languages?  
I second u/Blaarg171's suggestion about Unity. I haven't used it personally but more and more people and companies are using it to build games. C# is one of the languages it supports so I still think it's a good suggestion.  
I want to create something to make my work go much much faster. I have zero experience. I essentially have to cut and paste multiple short paragraphs and a photo into a new email.  I work at a talent agency and I pitch clients to casting directors. Each email is the same: GREETING ROLE 1 NAME ACTOR 1's PITCH ACTOR1's HEADSHOT ACTOR 2's PITCH ACTOR 2's HEADSHOT ROLE 2 NAME ETC ETC SIGN OFF I'm assuming I'd need something like Pythin could do this but I have no idea.  What I'd imagine making is basically a list of text inputs where I could type in the role name, then the actors names etc and it would compile all the information from some sort of database so I could just cut and past it into an email instead of doing each actor individually. Any help on where to start could be appreciated!  
Sounds a bit like reinventing the wheel. Can this not be done using Outlook and mail merge? You can also combine with and call from other office apps like Excel and Word for the various fields.  
Someone is down voting everyone so don't take it seriously.  You could try your luck by asking this on r/learnpython.   
Python is a reasonable choice. When I read your comment the first thing that popped into my head was this: Automate the Boring Stuff which is a Python book.  I haven't read it, myself, but I've seen it recommended quite a bit.  
And in case you don't want to learn python I think you can do something like this in word, of course python would probably better though   
Authotkey. It's a scripting language/program, way easier to read and easy to get started. You just open up the notepad document (right clicking on the autohotkey icon in the system tray and click edit script), and make new hotkeys on the fly! With these hotkeys, you can emulate almost any human input with mouse and keyboard. I've scripted about 400 rows of copying and pasting to make purchase orders at my job. Used to take 1-2 hours - now it takes 15 mins of my computer doing something and I can get up and do something else while it does that. Talk about efficiency <3  
[deleted]  
I agree with most of this. Especially changing your way of thinking and not picking a language just because it's the new hotness.  I do know that some people find the switch in thinking more difficult than others. Something about the logic flow and breaking problems down low enough are difficult for them. Others have no problem at all.  I think the low-level vs. high-level language debate is understandable, and naturally some people will really want to dig into what's really going on in the beginning. My impression is that most beginners want to start building stuff ASAP. That's why I, personally, prefer to suggest a top-down approach. Learn a lot of the general principles and concepts in a language where you don't have to muck with memory and pointers, etc. and then start backfilling your knowledge with those lower-level languages and concepts. That way you're focused on those aspects that are unique to the language (and level). C/C++ aren't the easiest to pick up and do that with. But if you know Javascript, you can learn Java, then you can learn C/C++. Each step gets you closer to the metal.   
I'm looking to start learning python then java. Anybody wanna learn together? I don't know how we would go about doing it but just message me and we'll figured something out I guess.  
Neat.   
I'd like to add that Dive Into Python is great for beginners who want to choose Python as their weapon. Great write-up!  
"First do it, then do it right, then do it better"   
Great post. I'll second the freeCodeCamp suggestion, I've been dabbling with their front-end exercises for the last couple of months and they're really fun and I feel like I've learned a lot. They also have gitter chat rooms where people are very helpful.   
[deleted]  
Do you have any alternative books/learning material from the c# book provided. When I glanced at the book it seemed to be all about creating a game. Where as I'm looking to go towards more design windows programs for companies.  Great post btw.  
Thanks! The book recommended in r/csharp is this, which is available in PDF for free.  The course that they recommend is this one. The books on Amazon seem to be hit or miss and many of the highly rated ones are out of date by at least 1 version.  Have you looked at the course I linked to in the post? What're your thoughts on that?  
My biggest problem is that i don't know why i want to learn programming. I don't have an app idea or a game idea. I want to work as a programmer, but don't know in which area.   
Interesting! Not everyone has an idea already, so I wouldn't put too much weight on that. Personally, I didn't have a specific plan or area that I wanted to go into. We can work on specific areas little by little.    What makes you excited about programming? Why that instead of some other profession?     
Well, I want to learn programming, because I want to work as a freelancer in much warmer country than mine :) I mention this problem, because I tried to learn many times, but droped after a few weeks-months. I tried C++ when I was young. A few years ago I tried python and I really like it, but I didn't know how and where to use it and get tired of solving puzzles on check.io. My last attempt was html+css+javascript, I made a few sites(bad one), pass a coursera course, tried jquery, node.js and angular and tried get a job. No need to mention that I failed :) Now I want to start again, but you know that doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is insane.   
Indeed it is. It feels like you need a goal. Learning for the sake of learning is fine, but since you want to become a professional, you'll need to get clear on what you want, then we can work backwards to figure out how to get there.   So you liked Python. That's a good language to start with. It's widely used but isn't as complex as C++. You can use Python to do: * Backend web development with Django * Machine learning * data science * scripting   Because you want to move to a different country and freelance, this will limit what you will do with your skills. Chances are good that you won't find freelance work in data science or machine learning (I could be wrong, but that's the way it appears). Often freelance work revolves around web development (frontend, backend, or full-stack), mobile development (iOS and Android), or some random apps.   What do you feel is an interesting field to work in?  
What's your view on SoloLearn to lean basics of coding? You can learn basics of multiple languages with this application and some of the most important ones. I'm dabbling in Ruby, Python and JavaScript with zero experience, I don't expect to come out after finishing with the knowledge to create an app/website/game through this service and and I just want to become good enough to practice the coding challenges they offer. It's available for IOS/Android and they have computer/website app to practice the courses also, they make the leaning gamified but also very social with helpful tips from past users on every course materials.   
SoloLearn is very good for getting the basics from a variety of languages. I used SoloLearn to learn C# and Python.  
SoloLearn is okay solely for learning language syntax and common practices. You will get to a point where SoloLearn is just too slow when you can just google how to do things, but it can be useful for getting you in the mindset for coding.  
I haven't used it and don't know anyone, personally, who has. But it seems like a number of people on this subreddit approve of it.  It's very unlikely that one resource will get you from 0 to junior dev. Even some of the larger courses on Udemy that claim to will require that you look up answers to questions or solutions to problems. Often, when you have trouble with a concept you'll need to get multiple, different discussions of the same thing in order to finally 'get it'.  If SoloLearn covers basics of the language's syntax, features and why/when to use them, then it's a perfectly fine way to start. Like starting with Codecademy, it'll get you somewhat familiar with basics of coding, but you'll need another resource to go from there to building usable apps.  
Thanks for the info  
You're welcome!  
I would like to add that one should learn concepts before learning a specific language.  
It depends on the goal, but for most people who want to become professional developers, I disagree.  In learning a specific language you are going to learn a lot of core concepts (implicitly and explicitly) and have concrete examples of them. The concepts that you don't learn as you're learning a language you can backfill later when you're already able to produce usable programs with your language.   
cs50!   
Yeah, or that it's not that important which language you start with. If I had to start from scratch today, I'd probably recommend Javascript, as it's ubiquitous, doesn't need any software or compiler installing, and has all of the common programming structures that you need to learn.  
Agreed. I tried to indicate the unimportance of the first language in the grand scheme, but most people want the most bang for their buck.  While I'm not personally a fan of JS, objectively I recommend it to people who ask because of the same reasons you mentioned. That is, of course, depending on their end goals. If they want to write operating systems or AI, I wouldn't recommend JS.  
Can you clarify what concepts you mean? For example, I agree you should try to understand what a "type" or "function" is before you can utilize it. Even then, learning about them is usually best done in conjunction with learning a language, so you can practice them and see how they work immediately. But higher-level concepts like clean and maintainable code, good abstractions, and design patterns can be more easily understood when you have a foundational understanding of how code works to start applying them.  
Respectfully, I think you are so wrong it hurts. I started learning Java from a book in 2000. Lots of people are like me and did great. If you qualify your position then I might agree. I don't think learning search&sort is more important than learning how to create a cool demo for beginners.  Combinatorics isn't required to write code even though they have a lot in common.  
By concepts I meant oop vs functional, learn where, when, why and how to use if-then, loops, etc. I have seen too many peers who "know" a language, but can't solve a simple problem where, e.g. recursion could be used.  
I hear you. I'd call that an intermediate to advanced problem though. We're talking about absolute beginner. As in, "what's a terminal?" beginner.  
Gold mine.  
Thanks!  
Have you gone or know of someone who's gone to a coding bootcamp and benefited? Maybe not get a job after day one but even months down the road and felt it was from it? I have 3 in mind. Learn Academy, Hack Reactor, Origin Code Academy. I've been doing coursework‚Äã for 8 months but feel that attending one would accelerate my learning, confidence and ability.   
Yes, actually I do know some people who went to bootcamps. They all found it very worthwhile and found jobs soon after graduating. If you want to talk more about, you can DM me.  
[deleted]  
You're welcome! Do it! You can create some awesome automation scripts for admining.   
Serious question: how come most posts or comments I see here regarding backend development rarely mention Java / Scala ?  
Excellent post! Thank you so much!  
You're welcome!  
Great post, I'm a beginner who is taking programming classes and def ran into many of those problems (opinion instead of advice, language choice, not knowing all the terminology, when taking a Python course in college.  Beginning of course was easy once I got the hang of it, by it quickly got faster paced and difficult. I heard people use GitHub, what are peoples experience with it? And are there any free code academies people recommend ?   
Github has become the de facto source control for a lot of the industry. Definitely learn how to use it.  Regarding free code academies, what kind of development are you looking to do?  
Great advice.  
Commenting for use when I get all the way home. Wee wee wee.  
Bookmarked. Thank you! My dad is a programmer so I knew more than the average Joe but I don't have much experience at all. Recently I started going through all of the programming courses on Khan Academy. They seem informative to me but what is the general consensus on KA and how far should I expect it to get me? Edit: Right now I'm learning JavaScript and I'm interested in web and game development. The Khan Academy courses seem to cater those fields as they teach mainly JS with some HTML and CSS. Is there a downside to JS? What you said above makes it seem like that's the most applicable language to know therefore the best to start with.  
KA gets recommendations here or there, but it doesn't seem to be the go-to place for most people. That said, if it's working for you and you like the way it presents the material, keep going. You're always going to use more than one resource since they'll fill in holes for each other and expand on material in different places.  If you're looking to do web development, JS is definitely the way to go as it's the de facto frontend language. Games, sure if they're web-based. If you're more interested in games, it would depend on your target platform. If you want to do mobile games for iOS, learn swift. Java (or now Kotlin) for Android apps. You can probably make cross platform games with JS with something like Phonegap or NativeScript.  Personally, if I were going to do cross platform games, I would learn Unity and probably C#.  Objectively, it does appear that JS is probably the best beginning language for getting into the field. Given the large number of jobs for it, the number of domains it can be used (desktop, mobile, web, backend), and the number of resources. Just remember that any language is a tool. And like any tool, it has its uses. Prepare to learn many languages so that you can learn to use the right one in the right situation.   
This is AWESOME, I'm going to show anyone who's interested in programming. lowkey tho i just made this comment so it easier to reference!  
I would start by learning the different elements of computer code.  Don't worry about the syntax of any particular language just yet.  Learn what a variable is and the different types (integers, strings, etc...)  Then learn about different operators that operate on those variables.  Then there's loops, functions and arrays.  Once you understand these basics and a few others, as well as how and why these elements occur in all computer languages, you can pick a language and move on from there.   Once you understand the basics of how programs work, you can get into the syntax.  It's like learning a foreign language.  First you need to understand what a verb is, a noun, an adjective, etc...  Then you can learn how that particular language puts them together.  
I love you, OP.  
[deleted]  
Great post! This ought to be stickied.   
Comment for later reference   
This is really informative. I plan to show it to a friend who is having a bit of trouble in the area. Any chance this post, if not already, could get flagged somewhere?  
This is awesome. I'm going to add this link to here on my blog. This is what I miss. Straight up great resources. www.codingafter30.com  
I love this! Thanks :D I'd also like to really emphasize on making gradual progress everyday in learning, AKA coding everyday. It's ok to skip a day or two in case of burnout, but always keep up the progress!  
check your local library to see if you can access lynda.com for free just by having a library card  
I have a serious grudge against online courses for whatever language because they don't teach programming. They teach the syntax of a language. What I need is to learn how to think like a programmer. This comment  is a perfect example: a real world problem that must be solved. How to judge what language is the best for this case? How to translate my needs into code? How to build an efficient alghoritm for this? THIS is what I need, not another extended rendition of Hello World.  
Another commenter made a good post and I'll link it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/6fto5j/how_to_start_learning_to_code_when_you_dont_know/dillyad/ How well do you know object-oriented principles? Functional? How well do you know your way around abstract data types like trees, queues, templates, etc? Start looking to learn these next. Seek out help via this subreddit or google to find resources on these subjects. When it comes to "language X over Y" like you're describing, that's going to be in the mannerisms of a given language. For example a language like C or C++ gives control over memory management which in some applications might be beneficial. C and C++ code also easily integrate with Assembly instructions so exceptional memory management can be performed while still providing support to C-level instructions like structs or C++ level instructions with support for object types like classes. This level of control is handled via pointers or reference addresses whereas other languages like Java might mask away pointers and handle this implictly. Knowing these differences is where you'll get into software engineering like you're describing. Note that I am still currently a student and learning more about things like OOP and functional programming, so take what I say with a grain of salt. However if some of these stuff went over your head or certain words made you pause for a moment and wonder what that thing was (e.g. trees, queues, templates), that's just a sign that you should go and learn about that subject. Although some argue against Youtube tutorials, I will say Derek Banas is a good instructor and he covers elements of object-oriented programming in his Java tutorial series. Here is one he has on object-oriented design and building UML designs.  Hope it helps.  
RemindMe! 8 hours  
You might want to that you can make Android apps in Kotlin. It's officially supported now.  
Indeed, it's exciting!  The current benefit to Java over Kotlin, in my mind, is that Java is used in a lot of places and domains. So if you learn it for Android, those skills can be utilized in other companies, jobs and domains. I know Kotlin can run anywhere Java can and can interact with it, but there's a ton of legacy systems out there written in Java that probably won't be updated with Kotlin code.  
My problem has always been where do I put the code to run it?  No training I've come across, code academy etc, explains this. They teach how to code, but what do I do with the code to have it accomplish something?  
A very valid question. I remember wondering the same thing when I was new to programming. Some toolstacks make it easy, some not so much.  Some people will say "Depends what you want to do". Imo beginners can use a bit more of a nudge in one direction, since you can't know you want to do something if you don't know it exists yet.  I'd highly suggest Python with Django for Web development. Once you're comfortable with the back-end, you can play around with Javascript in the front-end.   
For those interested in game development your 'weapon' is C++.  
Is mobile development with C# and Xamarin a bad idea?  
Not at all. Learning C# will allow you expand into Windows development, game development (with Unity) and backend web development. I, personally, don't like cross-platform apps as a general rule. They tend to be a little 'off' - like the uncanny valley. They're getting better, but I still have a personal dislike of them.  That said, there are clear advantages to having 1 codebase, and being able to hit all major platforms at once, mainly it's cheaper and no issues with syncing features across platforms.  
I think the best way is to have the new learner build data structures, of course there's the syntax hoops they have to jump through first, but if you're building something you can visualize in 3D you're going to see how all the stuff fits together.  Count this as a vote to leave all those new fangled languages till later and built data structures in C or C++.  
Thanks! I was really looking for a post like this. MVP!  
How did the letters PHP manage to be left out of your entire essay? I mean, it's good advice and all, but PHP is one of the best server side languages there is.

So java is only valid as an android language and ruby is a back end language?  I've seen ruby used more for devops tooling and java for back ends, maybe I'm out of the loop?  I am definitely a few JS frameworks behind, but who's not?

Cool thanks!  
You're welcome!  
I've heard and seen everywhere that Python is language that you should start with, what is your opinion on that?  
I've been following the Odin Project for about a month now. currently taking the html & css material on codecademy. Its been really fun  
As someone learning... this is all so true. I spent the first 6 months of learning starting 7 different books, 3 websites and 4-5 video series without doing anything significant in that time.  I think the best thing for someone starting is actually to get a good book for whatever language they learn and go for a beginner book... I found so many times that a lot of videos online don't really go into depth and you end up doing List<T> in a C# video after the first Hello World application. It might just be me, but it seems like quite a jump before you even go through understanding reference and value variables, understanding arrays properly... hell... understanding namespaces.  A book has the advantage of being able to go through more depth a bit earlier. I enjoyed the Fundamentals for C# development free PDF... I'd probably recommend it to a lot of people just because it does hammer on the fundamentals for the first 10-11 chapters and it does give exercises for each chapter end so you can really work your way through it.  I think a lot of these programs seem to lack that structure... But again, it might just be the way I'm used to studying so your experience might be different :) Same as I didn't like FCC that much, but after going through John Ducketts books on HTML/CSS and his JS book I felt a lot more comfortable working through the exercises. I feel that a lot of these courses and especially the C# Head First book, just kind of throw you into "just do this worry about it later" mentality and I feel that it does lead to a certain level of inadequacy later on. You will use Lists but not know why you might be using those instead of an array when you just want to hold 5 numbers and not change contents or not understand why your application is not returning what you expect it to return. Not to mention one of the biggest weaknesses I've seen in a lot of online programs being that they put very little focus on writing clean and maintainable code. I remember doing some java online tutorial for school a while back (in that period of starting 20 resources in 6 months) and I checked with a friend "hey, whadaya think" and he just replied - what's "a" in this context?; "it's a VARIABLE! I thought you were a developer and knew what I wanted to say!" or "why did you not comment this method? why is this method going 3 things? why not split it up? why not explain what they do?" And I couldn't answer a lot of the questions because I didn't know any better :)) I still don't :))  Again, I don't want to harp on as I'm no developer by any stretch and I'm just now warming up on posting my first bit of program by the end of this month to get some code review done, but I feel that as someone who is struggling to find resources a lot of these don't cover those elements that help you structure code well. Anyways I'll get back to learning :) Thanks for all the resources!  
I would truly appreciate some more specific guidance on this topic. Foundation material is wonderful. Thanks much   
How to start: just write some code. Pick a language, any language, and just start making stuff. Doesn't matter what. Between Google, Stackexchange, Github, youtube, reddit, orielly, IRC, mailing lists, and the websites for the languages themselves, there's no shortage of help. Just write some code and when you get stuck, use the internet.  
Fantastic man. Thank you.  
Thank you for this post and all the awesome ressources   
How would you recommend I get all of the info I need to fully learn how to create some games in Unity or Unreal engine if all I can use are books because I'll have no internet or connection to the outside world for the next year? I'll be living in the middle of nowhere in a few weeks and basically all I'll be able to use are books, PDFs, and maybe whatever collection of YouTube videos and stuff I can download. All of the reviews I've seen for Unreal and Unity are bad and say that they barely teach shit and that none of them are for beginners, nor do they walk you through making a single simple game start to finish. I'd love to be able to make a 2D platformer fighting game like Mega Man or something, maybe not as indepth with the weapons and armor yet, but know how to do it. I have plenty of money saved up for a new fast laptop, external HDD, and books.  So please, if you can, can you give me a list of game programming or general programming and maybe 2D/3D design and animation books, that if I bought this entire set of books, it and hard work would be all I need to make some complete video games start to finish with basically zero background in programming and a basic background in photoshop?  
Nice read. Commenting here to make sure I don't lose this thread.   
Thanks buddy. I'm happy to add you to Skype. I just need to remember my password :/   
Thank you so much. It helped a lot  
that's fucking amazing. are the course materials and any sample code available?  
Second this. Any homeworks available too?  
lectures are interesting but most of the work occurs outside lecture so that's specifically why I was requesting those materials  
Coding assignments were done on vocareum, so I doubt many of the people in the course downloaded them. The written assignments are PDFs not publicly available though I did save them when I took the course last fall.  
Could you please share the assignments and PDFs for the same?  
It makes sense the assignments wouldn't be available, Distributing them would probably make cheating far too tempting for people taking the class now. ha.... so many ppl want the answers. I'll pm you if I ever have a direct question I can't surpass. i cant see the harm in sharing the coding assignments, not the code just the tasks to complete if possible.  Thanks man  
Assignments aren‚Äôt available on public, they‚Äôre assigned and graded through a Cornell website that requires a netid  
[deleted]  
For anyone else interesting in looking into more stuff like this, there's this website where MIT stores most of its courses information and assignments: https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm  
Does anyone by chance have the solutions to the placement exam?  
What kind of math do I need to know to keep up?  
Machine learning requires statistics, Lin alg, and multivariable calc. But you could probably just take the professors word on a lot of the differentiation.  
Haven't taken this course specifically, but at least for the deeplearning.ai course, having an understanding of single variable calculus and an understanding of matrices was good enough to understand the intuitions behind ML/NNs.  
Might anyone have resource recommendations for these two concepts? I'm super interested in this stuff, but concerned that my no-more-math-just-play-jazz-and-read-poetry approach to education after 11th grade pre-calc will prove to be a hindrance.  
Try Khan Academy  
Edx, and MIT opencourseware. Look into professor Strang for the MIT courses. Brilliant and concise.  Opencourseware is full MIT courses from like 7+years ago. They have all the assignments and tests and everything there. Not sure about answers. And they dont have the readings. But it's a damn good start.  
Khan Academy + Wikipedia should be enough  
Google PatrickJMT (YouTube) and Paul's Online Math Notes.  
Absolutely checkout 3Blue1Brown's linear algebra playlist on youtube, I liked this as well  
I'm assuming you mean derivation  
He meant what he said  
There‚Äôs a test you take to assess for the math needed (usually linalg and differentiation). I‚Äôll see if I can try an older one in pdf (source: I took the class and jumped ship when I saw that test).  
The course starts off with a preliminary stats exam that covers basic probability (around difficulty of Bayes‚Äô Rule).  
[deleted]  
Edited: Thanks! I took the class one of the best classes I have taken.  
I second this! Kilian was fantastic even though my attendance last fall took a huge nose dive at the end, but the video lectures and his notes really helped me catch up and understand the material.  
[deleted]  
Killian‚Äôs ML class is one of the best CS electives at Cornell. I don‚Äôt know a lot of people that are serious CS majors that graduate without this class on their transcript.  
I saw only the Gaussian Process lectures. They were quite nice. I found Prof Weinberger‚Äôs lecture, dare I say it, even better than Prof Mackay‚Äôs lecture on the topic.  
Should this be preferred over Andrew Ng?  
https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/bu6645/cornells_entire_machine_learning_class_cs_4780_is/ep953t0/  
My coworker Andy went to Cornell and wont shut up about it. Says he was drunk the whole time...  
I know him too.  Also won't shut up about his a capella skills and some guy named Brocolli Rob...  
Here comes treble. Those guys were annoying.  
r/unexpectedoffice  
Thanks for sharing! Studied Bio at Cornell with a focus on Neurobio and left before I fell in love with ML. Prepping for grad school in ML at the moment. This series is just the right mix of nostalgia, humor, and info! This series is much appreciated  
4780 ? So , this is a 4th year college level class ? Could a middle aged , educated person learn this ?  
if you have taken statistics, Lin alg, and multivariable calc, yes.  
Are the homework assignments for the class available online somewhere?  
I would like to know this as well

If you‚Äôre learning Python and you‚Äôre also interested in ML, HumbleBundle is running a promotion on several ML and AI books, with quite a few in Python.  
Can you link this? I found one but it said it was over.  
Unfortunately, I believe it ended yesterday.  
4chan/t/thread/862821  
Well, if you know MATLAB you also know Julia. Still wanna use python‚ÄΩ ‚Ä¶oh, you do. Gotcha. Nvm.  
Python is the shit. Install numpy and scipy and matplotlib and go nuts on some canned data.  
Started off good but then he said to put your laptops away so now I'm posting this from my phone and I haven't learned a thing.  
Wow, that's an incredibly positive review of a professor. Sounds like someone I wish I had in college! I will definitely be checking this course out. ‚Äã Thanks!  
Kilian Weinberger? Ya, he's the best. My University should have never let him get away.  
Ayyy good old Killean. Fun fact: this guy rides one of those one wheeled hover boards around campus.  
Oh, hey, that's my old neighbor!  Yeah, Kilian's a great guy, and great sense of humor.  He told me last year that he originally started recording his lectures as a resource for his students and didn't think much of them, but then later found out other people from all over started watching them.  Next thing he knows he's getting called out at conferences: "Oh, you're the guy on YouTube!"  
Is this something someone would pick up if they‚Äôve completed CS50?  
Machine Learning is really not something like a data structures course or a systems course. It is really just a mathematics course. So having classes in statistics, Lin alg, and multivariable calc is a better indicator  than any previous CS course.  
Stats, linear algebra, and Python libraries were my big takeaways from my ML class. Actually, mostly Python libraries and me saying "what on Earth is an eigenvector?" I haven't taken linear algebra, so it was a rough quarter.  
I took linear algebra (in 2012) and I still don't know what an eigenvector is, and I'm not sure I ever really did. However, I'll be taking Machine Learning pretty soon so I better brush up haha.  
I was in your shoes about a 1.5 years ago regarding CS50. You definitely can do machine learning with some basic python skills. However, as the other poster said, you definitely want to go through a stats course and have multivariable calculus down. You don't have to be amazing at these subjects. If you are just going for applied (not research focused or AI), you can get away the basics if you're willing to learn along the way. Recently, I've been working for a company classifying audio data using convolutional neural nets and it's been a blast! If you're passionate, you can do it.  
how is this compared to some other popular ml courses(namely stanford's)?  
No one can beat Andrew Ng  
the course web site says you should do the first 3 weeks of Andrew's course to prepare yourself for this course http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4780/2018fa/index.html Prerequisites:   Mathematical maturity and experience Students interested in preparing for the placement exam ahead of class are advised to work through the first three weeks of Andrew Ng's online course on machine learning.   
True, but his course is around 5-10 years old. ML has come a long way since the stuff he covers (unless he has something newer that I'm not aware of... in which case please let me know because he's amazing). Edit: To be clear, I'm certainly not saying his course isn't good. I'm just saying there's a lot more to learn than what he covers.  
 (unless he has something newer that I'm not aware of... in which case please let me know because he's amazing  https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/  
4780 is also a classical supervised learning course: focuses on linear classifiers, kernel methods, mathematics, and some fundamentals like the bias-variance tradeoff and ways to impact it with things like bagging and boosting.  There's a brief section devoted to deep learning at the end and one of the programming assignments was to implement a MLP, but it's not the focus of the course.  
By come a long way, I think you mean deep learning and he had a free course on that in coursera.  
Thank you!!!  
This is awesome! Thank you for sharing!!!  
MIT also has agreat deal of free courses  
just looked through the videos quickly I don't if ill be able to understand it what some of the pre-reqs

Wow!!! A must watch  
This is exactly what I wanted, exactly when I needed. You sir / ma‚Äôam are a champ.  
UUh it's in Python. Nice!  
Awesome  
Still can't decide what acapella group to join  
That's really cool. At least the professor is funny it makes the time pass by and you actually learn something.  If you want to know what the experts say about learning to program. Read this article  https://waetechsolutions.com/website-design-buffalo-ny/  
Wow this is great; thank you for posting it. I'm through the first 9 lectures and am loving it.  
Thanks a ton :)  
I'm 49 an never went to college, is it possible for me to break through? Looking for my career  
I might be 3 months late, but I just saw your comment and I want to say go for it!  
This is one of the best resources for machine learning I have ever found. Thank you!  
Amazing  
If I've never learned R or Python, is this course useful? I have my MBA and have a little bit of experience with analytics (SPSS, JMP) but want to sharpen my skills.  
I have decided I would rather have a machine learning lecture from the vastly superior Dartmouth  
Nice. Dude. If you ever find other resources like this one let me know. PM me  
As a general rule of thumb MIT's OpenCourseware (OCW) is full of this type of course, usually with full supplemental materials for psets, exams, recitations, etc. It's literally exactly the same course material and is pretty good as long as the professor isn't a terrible teacher.  
Thanks.

r/TIL !!!!!  
People like you are why I don't just quit the Internet! Thanks Friend.   
Thank you for such a detailed answer!  
Think of it as a marathon not a sprint. Can't stress this enough. cs50 is great but it can break you. Maybe do it alongside other things so you don't feel like garbage when you hit a wall. There are plenty of Harvard students (so very smart people) who have one on one time with mentors available on campus to help them with the course, and they swear that it's too difficult.  
what? I thought it was called cs50 because it was like more basic  than a cs101 class.  
This is great advice! There will be many walls.   
I clicked the link for cs50, is the program free or fee based? I think I've also seen this linked to the OSSU as well?  
When I did it last year it had a free option and a paid option for around 90 bucks. The paid option gets you a certificate. I wouldn't recommend the paid option because I don't think anyone really cares about the certificate and also the completion ratio for online students is very low.  
Traversy Media on youtube is a dope channel too for programming. Brad‚Äôs a cool dude and a cool teacher. Thanks for your post. Lots of people seems like are in the same boat as we are.  
Agreed!  
+1 for Traversy Media!  
Keep in mind, you don‚Äôt need to go deep into all of those links, just a little to know what it‚Äôs about: e.g. you don‚Äôt need to know all there is in embedded systems if you want to web development.  
[deleted]  
I‚Äôm currently looking for an entry level developer and couldn‚Äôt care less about a degree if the basic foundation and aptitude are there, but this person would have a lead dev to learn from. Look for opportunities with companies in trade industries where degrees aren‚Äôt as important in general.  
[deleted]  
That‚Äôs always a challenge. There are certain questions I ask in interviews to gauge reasoning ability and logic, intelligence, and understanding of the business case. The skill set is very job specific and will vary based on company and projects: I work for a windows company with a central ERP that requires knowledge of SQL, JavaScript, Jquery, .Net, HTML, CSS and more depending on what the application is.  
Where to these companies exist? Because I'm in Oklahoma and have gone nowhere with this drive and passion. At least, with web dev and certain other dev.  
There must be electrical/plumbing/HVAC/grocery/liquor distributors in your area. Think about business-to-business companies whose brands and industries might not have a consumer presence but play integral roles in the livelihood of your area. If there‚Äôs an industry booming in your area or one that interests you, research all levels within the vertical and see which provides the best opportunities for your skill set. Charities and nonprofits can also provide a good opportunity to gain experience.  
Free code camp has resources for this. They also have a good forum.   
I can somewhat chime in, have a git page, most won't even look at it but just saying you have one with crap on it will give you a huge boost.  
I used this, and was well prepared for a really tough coding interview: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0984782850/  
StackOverflow is a great resource but it also has a very high bar for question quality, and it isn‚Äôt the place to "bounce ideas around". A question that is too vague, chatty, or unspecific will get downvoted and closed almost instantly. OP, I don‚Äôt mean to discourage you, only to warn you that asking questions on StackOverflow can be a slightly traumatizing experience for new programmers, unless your question is very well researched and presented.  
[deleted]  
I've been using SO for several years now and don't even have an account. If you know what to search at that point, it's already going to be there. I'm only getting deep enough now that I'm considering making an account.  
This is the best!   
MIT also has free classes in cs and a lot of other subjects. I didn‚Äôt see it up there but they are good, all sorts of specialty subjects like machine learning and ai and general stuff too Edit:  course subject link   
Quincy Larson of freecodecamp sends out a list of MOOC's every couple of weeks, his mailing list is great!  
 Stackoverflow is your friend where you can ask any question you have or bounce ideas off of others.  I was just reading this before coming to this post: https://old.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/9n24fl/stackoverflow_is_super_toxic_for_newer_developers/  
Stack Overflow has a lot of information, it's a great place to search for your problem - chances are you'll find what you need. Asking questions on SO can be tough, I know.  
It really is. Every time I went there with a question, I got hammered with people that just want to make me feel stupid. Reddit has some groups that aren't like that, so I just use reddit.  
I have to agree, based on one single question I wrote there,and the mnay many answers I've read. I sadly avoid stackoverflow in all situations posible.  Basically, a couple years ago I was playing with python and decided I wanted to make a simple little web scraper that showed me current gpu deals on newegg (I was getting into crypto a little too hard for my wallet). Forthis, I chose beautiful soup,and had no idea what I was doing.  I had run into the price tags and snagged an issue where the price was something like <div>dollars<div>cents/<div></div> or spmething rediculous along those lines. Anyways, when my scaper pulled the amount it displayed it on 4 completely seperated and randomly formatted lines... I was genuinely curious as to WHY this happened when everything else worked perfectly and my code, to me, was perfect for getting the price... Long story short, after hours of recieving nothing but "copy this code" and bashing, with no answer to my actual question, I posted to reddit.  Now I don't remember what the answer was but within 30 minutes someone explained it to me and I went on my merry way witha new understanding of just wtf I was doing.  Moral? If you got a question, come to reddit, you'll be much happier. If nobody here can give you an answer, prepare yourself, put the project aside for a week or so, post it to stack exchange, reportback in a week and filter through the salt and crap answers and pray you see what you're looking for. Anyways, good luck, I'm in nearly the same boat as you, trying to get into development with no actual background, so feel free to hit me up if you feel the need.  
can confirm  watched all the harvard lectures back in 2015 watched a bunch of the calculus bigger picture videos did a bunch of c# projects by following along line for line from youtube videos  got a job after 9 months for 40k, after 3 years there im making 90k at my new job in the midwest now and can afford to go back to get a bachelors**  
Somebody gild this man! Best advice I‚Äôve seen on here.  
Thank you for this information.   
Lol throw someone into arch Linux. Ah the joys of spending two days for an install. Great docs though.   
 stack overflow Friend  ... Yeah right.   
It‚Äôs a good resource to search, asking questions is another thing.   
I recall there also being a broad 'beginners' CS ebook that was highly recommended too, a passion product by a self-taught professional. I think I may still have the bookmark... https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook/ Never put down the cash for it, but it did seem like a good way to broach some of the more confusing aspects (Big-O is obtuse if you're not that familiar).  
Thanks for all the info mate  
u/flipadelphia22, literally all the info you need right here! God damn, what a good answer  
Arch linux lol  
I'm saving this post for my husband, thank you so much   
I love you.  
I love you too.  
I'm in a similar situation as the OP, and appreciate all the information! As a starting point, where would one start when it comes to math? After taking a look at the OSSU, what worries me is the math portion. It has been almost 20 years since I have touched any algebraic math, hence I have a feeling I will have to start from scratch. Can anyone shed some light on where I should start and how important these core math concepts will be as I progress through the course? I have attempted programming before and I am determined to succeed however I feel like i'm missing some baseline math skills that will be valuable to my success in any of these programs including CS50. Thanks!!  
I‚Äôd just jump into CS50, you don‚Äôt need any advanced math skills. The important thing is to just get started.   
Can confirm - literally switched careers to CS starting with Harvard CS50, it's the best free introduction you could possibly get.  
I was a mailman for a a couple of years, until at 34 I changed tracks to software development, and things are going pretty well for me. You can do it OP!  
congratulations to your success!   
Queuing up: congrates man.  
Lol mailmen turned techies unite! I was a mail carrier but eventually got into data science.  
Roughly how much do you make? Just curious to get some ball park numbers  
I switched careers at 35 to development. Started at $75k but was at $180k within a year (switch jobs) working remote. After 5 years used the skills I learned to start my own online business and clear more than that now.  Marketing yourself properly is important.   
how did you get into software development? sounds like you were already working as a different role in an IT company if you started at 75k.  
I got into software development by learning how to program in the evening.  The job prior to my first programming job was in graphic design.   
$180k remote after one year? What the actual fuck I am jealous  
Not really comfortable discussing it, but I'm definitely on the lower half of this chart üòÖ https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/salesforce-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,20.htm  
C'mon dude, it's the internet... Just take what you make, add $10k, tell us that number, and feel better about yourself. üôÇ  
Ah well, its 90k in that case lol.  
This "taboo" is exactly why companies get away with massive pay gaps and discrimination. Silence in this case, golden only for executives.   
I get that, but elsewhere in the thread we have a dude explaining how low on the ladder and low value my job is, reinforcing my reluctance to share personal details. The sort of one upmanship I was trying to avoid.i also reveal my rough pay elsewhere in the thread   
What is a sales force developer?  
They write plugins / custom things for businesses, some businesses have full time salesforce developers  
Basically Salesforce is a CRM platform that many different companies use for their sales/marketing teams. To many people working on this kind of application can be extremely boring.  
Salesforce is a CRM platform, but its pretty extensible. Most of what I work on involves manufacturers and their needs to manage orders, invoices, inventory on top of the regular sales and marketing stuff.  
Sales force developer? I‚Äôve heard a lot of bad things about being a sales force developer (tedious, bad documentation, ect.), is any of it true? There are a ton of Salesforce developer position around my area.  
Its the only area I've worked in, so its hard for me to make a comparison to other industries, but I can answer some questions.  Depends on your definition of tedious.If you like crazy problems and cutting edge technology, you'll probably be bored. If you like delivering solutions, making your customers happy, its good.  Documentation is pretty good. I dunno how it was five years ago, but I've never had an issue in that area.  Syntactically, Salesforce's DSL is basically java. I enjoy my work. Haters gonna hate.  
Web / DB developer to Salesforce developer here. My opinion of the platform is that it has actually allowed me to grow as a developer. My daily work as a consultant involves a head-spinning mix of requirements analysis, design, integration development, creating custom interfaces and playing Sherlock Holmes to find that random bug that's stopping someone from their work. All this for multiple clients every day. I say it's helped me grow as a developer because the platform has governer limits on what code you can execute. Only so many queries to the database, so many http callouts... things like that. It basically forces you to tighten up your routines and really put in a lot of design effort to make the best solution you can. And because it all is relatable to other languages like Java, SQL, that is experience you can take out to other platforms as needed. Integrations-wise, I've never worked with so many disparate platforms in my life. Every company I've worked with has a different ecosystem and they all want it integrated into Salesforce. For this reason, I've gained broad knowledge on so many platforms and integration patterns that I may never have otherwise. But I would not start with Salesforce as an initial platform. There is A LOT to learn, even for a seasoned developer.  There is plenty of good advice in this thread that I agree wholeheartesly with.  My two cents is learn how to write a simple video game, even something text-based. You'll learn pretty quickly whether its something you desire to do or not.  
Thanks! I didn't see a chart though, all I see is three positions with different rates, was that what you meant?  
Same here. Except quit at 28. Glad to know there's more to us than delivering bills and coupons.   
Oh man, mailing paid the bills, but ruined my knees for eternity. I now totally hate driving. edit: removed extraneous k  
It just takes some dedication. Programming isn't easy and it's not something everybody can do but it's something a lot of people can do if they're willing to put in the time and effort.  
How long did switching tracks take till you got a paying job? My guess was always 1-3 years of working almost daily 4-6 hours. It all depends on persons aptitude, but that was the timeframe I would always guess.  
About 6-8 hours of training a day for nine months.  
I always wanna know: how long did it take you from when you started to get a job?  
Honestly, I had a job as soon as I completed the 'bootcamp' I attended via one of it's primary sponsors. The pay and hours were below industry standards however, until I demonstrated competence. Others in my training cohort (that learned the material well) and decided to forego signing up with said sponsor, their job hunting had had varying degrees of success. One found work immediately, another took about 3 months, another is still looking, and another decided to form his own consultancy. It's been about a year. I can say, out of the small sample size of 10, everyone who understood what we were doing and wanted to work hard have found employment. Edit: didn't really answer the question. Our training program was nine months. So nine months.  
I'm 40+ Did a bootcamp... now have job. My previous career was technical (networking) but had no programming involved in it.  
Did you go straight from bootcamp to job?  Or were there other steps in there, to refine you skills?  
Few months after bootcamp I got my job.  I spent a month brushing up my resume / studying after the bootcamp ended. I did put A LOT of time into the bootcamp.   If I was going to do it I was all in.   If it wasn't eat or sleep, or family, I was coding. IMO in order to learn / stand out if you're doing a bootcamp, you gotta put in A LOT of extra time.     
which bootcamp did you attend to???  
It was one of those university associated ... but actually run by Trilogy Education Services.   I have strongly mixed views on their program.... one day I'll post my rambling review ;)  
Sorry for my ignorance but what is a boot camp , how long do they last, prereqs for joining? How does it help get a job? Cost?  
A technical school for programming. Usually 16hrs/day, lasting for 2-3 months. They cost generally in the $15k-$20k range. They help with getting a job, but they used to help much more. More recently, they're known for turning out mass numbers of somewhat-decent applicants who end up flooding the entry-level market. A computer science degree is more valuable than a bootcamp, but a bootcamp is faster. If you have connections a bootcamp is the way to go. If you don't a computer science degree is the way to go.  
Thanks for the info.   
Can I ask what made you switch that way?  I'd heard some talk that server infrastructure and networking are more stable positions as they can't really be outsourced as easily? Also not sure if the salary is a lot better in programming or anything like that.  Admittedly the people making the server and networking jobs sound good to me have an interest in doing so, so I'm unsure if that part was accurate.   
I just didn't want to do it anymore.   Wanted to do something new.  
 Is it unrealistic of me to think I can become a programmer at 34 with no real background in programming?  No. Don't ever think in those terms, met devs online who got into the fields at their 40. 2 years later, lead of android development team in the place he is working at.  ‚Äã  
This comment gives me so much hope for a future in programming  
If you enjoy doing it, do it. Good things will come. You have no idea how many people I met online landing me a helping hand and told me don‚Äôt give up when it comes to learning to program.   
You can definitely do it! I started taking a few community college progrmaming classes at 31 with a previous degree in French and a shitty data entry job.  Fast forward to age 34 I have a job as a software dev. I'm still going to school at night and probably won't have my degree before I'm 38, but hey.. I was going to be 38 anyway so I might as well have the degree.   
Good call! I just started this last year at 29 going for computer science. You really just have to look ahead and think hey, I‚Äôm gonna be 34 regardless, I might as well be 34 with a new degree/career rather than 34 and still wondering if you‚Äôre too old. Same goes for any age.   
I'm 32 and just got accepted to software engineering, I start in January.   
28 just applied very excited! I just got tired of handling Service for Tech Start Ups   
I got my CS degree when I was 39, and there were others that were older so age isn't an issue.  There's people on here that say they didn't have to go to school and they got jobs as front end developers.  I'm assuming you'd work and go to school?  That's fine, don't quit your job if you don't absolutely have to.  My advice, go through Khan, find what you like, java, backend, front end, etc and see what options are out there in your area and what they require.  If you have to go back to school, you'll have to do some high end math, but once you get into the job, you probably won't need it.  I originally went for a two year at a community college, but the town I was in had almost no IT jobs, so I had to look elsewhere.  All the big cities though had four year schools that were putting out people with bachelors so I couldn't compete.  So went back for a four year degree and got a job about eight hours away.  
Dang how was night school? Were you actually able to get the bachelors in 4 years?  
You should look into WGU not a shill lmao  
Do you definitely recommend WGU? Totally serious question. I'm really considering it. Thanks in advanced.   
I'm in WGU atm for cyber security. I really like it, it works for my study style and lifestyle. Everything is online and can be done from home aside from some certification exams. Life experience counts towards your degree and if you get the classes for your term done before the term ends you can do next terms classes. I did two terms in one term the first half of this year.   
Yes. I'm a current student and it's been huge for me. If you want details I can PM.  
Did you do WGU?  
Didn't do night school.  So I worked at a job and they decided they were going to build a bigger center in a larger city.  Some of us saw the writing on the wall.  That's when I did the two year degree because I figured I had two years before they shut us down, and I was right.  I stay until they closed to get severance, then spent time looking for jobs.  After about three months of no response, I looked at the four year path.  It took 2.5 years as all my basics and three CS classes were done (all the other CIS classes I had at the 2 year school didn't transfer...).  So it was 12 - 18 hours a semester of CS classes and high level math which was not a fun time.  It helped that for the first year and a half I didn't have to work from what I had saved.  
I'm 30 and started my 4 year bs last year.   I've read on here and elsewhere that there is discrimination against older people (not 22 year old), which has been a concern of mine.  
It's only a concern in Silicon Valley where everyone is a twenty-something recent grad who hasn't been burned out by the tech giants yet... I'd say the vast majority of dev jobs don't give a darn about your age.  
Got my first dev job at 35. Don't feed the age stereotype. No one is going to turn away a competent employee that works well with others.  
I sit in on developer interviews for my company.  Your situation could definitely be framed in a positive light. If you've held steady jobs since high school it shows that are already comfortable being in a professional environment. Even if those jobs weren't programming.  One risk that we consider with 22 year olds is that they don't really know their adult self yet. They've likely never dealt with office culture or true adult responsibilities.   
From what I've seen, that applies to start ups as they're focused on newer technologies.  Fact of the matter is, there's so much legacy stuff out there, most companies can't discriminate against older devs because they need their skills.  Admittedly you might not have those skills, but these companies don't care about age.  I mean maybe if you were 55, but not 30 something.  
Got a job after 2 years self study and that includes a boot camp. Dude, you got another 30+ years until retirement, I would definitely rather put a lot of effort in and do a career I love than not put effort in and be what most people call ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù.  You can do it man, patience and persistence are key!  
I think it has to do with lifestyle more so than background. Are you married with kids? Have an active social life? Do you have hours to spare every day? Are you able to resist the temptation to consume media like movies, TV shows and games in lieu of much less immediately (but ultimately far more) gratifying things? Anything can work if you're willing to treat it like work, but most people this age are properly chained into position and have very little free time or leeway.  
[removed]  
True! I meant in terms of free time alone, definitely no shade on spousal support or those who can juggle that much, I'd think you're the exception to this though. Good work and good luck regardless!  
[removed]  
33, married, with a 4 month old. In my first semester while working 60 hours a week. I have never known what it meant to struggle until now. I so feel you on that 5 hours a night.  Good luck and keep grinding!  
20+ year software developer here. I've also been a hiring manager at one of the big, Seattle-based tech giants and a number of other companies.  You are definitely not too old to start. I once hired a woman in her 50's who started going to school after her kids were grown. You can do it. It's hard work to get there. You'll need determination and to be ready for the effort. (But no more than getting a college degree in any challenging subject.) The best way is to get a college degree, but even that's not really required. What's required is understanding how to develop software. A Master's degree is better, but not required either. You may be able to enroll directly in a Master's Degree program if you already have an undergraduate degree and are willing to take 'required classes' that give you a baseline. If you don't want to get a college degree, you can self-teach. Some of the best engineers I've known didn't go to college. They were self-taught and made tons of cash. To self-teach the key is not just to do on-line coursework, it's to actually begin developing programs. More on this below.  In the end, you'll need to go into interviews and demonstrate knowledge of 'Algorithms' and 'Data Structures'. Here's the book you need to learn. I'm literally serious when I say that simply learning to write Python or Java code to solve all the homework problems in this book is step one to get you a $100K/year job.  Step two is getting some practical experience, There are a couple ways to do this. One of the best ways is to get involved with a popular open source project and beginning to contribute code to the project. Like for example, this one, or this one, or this one. Working in open source is a volunteer effort that gets you learning how to be part of a 'development team' and how to use source control and github. Open Source projects are best considered 'communities of developers' (small or large) that work together to solve a common problem. They'll critique your code and make you better. Other developers can be tough (not unlike subreddit communities on Reddit), but generally are supportive, Don't let trolls get you down when you find them (and you likely will). The knowledge of algorithms from the book is key to give you the knowledge needed to pass 'coding interviews' in today's job market. And the open source experience will help you develop the practical knowledge and give you 'street creds' that will get you in the door. I've hired over 100 engineers and managed teams large and small. I'm 100% confident that this approach - if you work at it - will get you into a solid, well-paying job.  
Age doesn‚Äôt matter. You face the same battle as everyone else, it‚Äôs not any more uphill. You need to learn the skills and then demonstrate you know them in order to get a job. Same as everyone else. If it‚Äôs what you want then just go for it.   
Hell, at 34, I've found learning to actually be much easier than when I was younger and dumber.  Having a mature brain is not a setback, as long as you aren't battling with some kind of pride issue.  
Same here. I was a terrible high-school student, I was interested but couldn't conform and teachers hated me for the most part. Spent too long in service industry type jobs and although I don't entirely agree with other posters here that age is not an issue in tech, I am employed. I have to keep learning (as in literally doing online courses) to keep up and to stay relevant. But it is much easier now than it was when I was young.

I am in the same boat man. Just having a hard time deciding. There is so many languages.   
Don't waste time stressing over which language to choose, just pick one and then you can later pivot if you want to when you're more knowledgeable.  
First you have to decide in which direction your professional career will go (front end, back end, databases, dev ops).   
Which would be the most interesting in you opinion?  
[deleted]  
Which do you recommend/not recommend for someone like me who wants a job for which they can just do their assigned work, not get a lot of hassle, and not have to bring their work home with them? (I am a high school math teacher and I also teach six hours a week as an adjunct, and I am stressed the fuck out.)  
Imo if you're just starting out pick Python. Its a fairly easy language to learn and incredibly versatile.  
Which language is not the problem. Most are the same with their own quirks. If you do understand computer science and how to use them a new language doesn't take long to learn.  The new syntax and quirks you can always look up. What takes a little time is understanding data structures, algorithms, design and that jazz.  
Java for real proper heavy dev with Spring and Hibernate later...js for scripting, frontend then HTML, CSS, and SQL skills to support all that.  Don't start with a scripting language like python or js. You won't learn enough fundamemtals. Go OOP...C#, Java, C++  
Skip formal institutions.   Start with online tutorials khan Academy/Udemy etc. Practice on your own (this will help you understand your gaps) Join a boot camp (cement what you learnt in step 1, fix what's lacking from step 2) Build some cool shit, practice- practice- practice.  (Collaborate with other people to build a small portfolio) Network, and think about the business/customer problem you want to solve.  This is a good way to land your first Gig. Most importantly, have fun. Programming is a skill that anyone can learn. Its also an art and your creativity and your unique perspective would help you differentiate yourself.

Degrees are great if you are young and have no experience - it shows you are committed and have a basic understanding of what you're going for. If you're in your +30's, just learn it on your own.  #5 is the best way to get the interview, #4 is the best way to do good in it. You don't have a degree or real world experience? Fine, then show me what you've built. And you had better be able to talk through every line of code so that the interviewer doesn't think you just copy/pasted something else.  
Go to college for the degree if you can financially and have time depending if you still want to work or what.  If not then follow the advice above.   
A pretty solid uphill battle - however, not much more than the average person learning programming.  A few things I‚Äôve learned - 1. Do it every day. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs 1 line or 1000 lines of code, get something down. This is your #1 rule as a student. 2. Draw it out. Any time you come across a problem, don‚Äôt write code - draw the problem on paper or a whiteboard, and solve it that way. Run a few different cases (ex: n=1, n=3, ...), and then see what you can figure out. THEN write code. 3. Learn why things work. Your job, as a programmer, is not to write code at 200wpm and collect employee of the month every month. Your job is to take a problem, split it into smaller and smaller problems, and solve each of those, until your original problem is solved. Learn the small problems, learn the small solutions, and learn why things are the way they are. 4. Make things - that‚Äôs what this career is about. Don‚Äôt stop at tutorials and think you‚Äôve learned it all. Make a diffie Hellman program, make an Android app, make a regression program from scratch. Never, ever, EVER stop making things. Even if you think, ‚Äúthis is absolutely useless!‚Äù - still, do something. 5. Try new things. Game dev, cryptography, language processing, web development, data structures, algorithms, ANYTHING. Programming does not reward specialists like other professions do, and you‚Äôll never know what you love until you‚Äôve tried it. 6. Google is your friend. 7. Learn to love the failure. I changed my mind, this is your #1 rule. You will fuck this up - coding that is. At some point, it will take 100 attempts to get code to run correctly once. That is the nature of this thing we call programming, and you cannot change it. You get better by trying, failing, contemplating, deciding where you went wrong, learning, sucking up your pride, and trying again. Kasparov was not born Kasparov, he became Kasparov - and you can too.  Godspeed friend. The internet is your friend, and we‚Äôre all rooting for you.   
When time allows, give freecodecamp.org a try.  It's more web related but good to add these skills to your resume if you're going to do programming anyway.  
[deleted]  
Good luck man. This is very encouraging   
a small systems project will boost it a lot for you. Something like writing a tiny subset of compiler or pet OS project or something in VM or something combining all of those running in a browser. Sky is the limit for projects  
[removed]  
Could you share how it's going for you? I'm very interested because I'm 41 and just enrolled in a CS program at a university in Germany.  
[removed]  
I don't have as much experience, but I had about 10 years of corp experience before I decided to take coding seriously and as a full time gig. I think having the ability to think about problems and solve them with development is something that is a great selling point to potential employers.  
I‚Äôm 33, I quit my job and went to boot camp in January and accepted a devops offer today  
What bootcamp  
I did this. You can too. I went Stanford cs101 => freecodecamp.org => Wes bos JavaScript courses => job. Looks like you‚Äôre getting a lot of support already. That is why it‚Äôs possible to make this transition. I‚Äôm sitting in a dentists office right now that a year ago I came to because I was grinding my teeth out of my skull because I was under so much pressure to find another career. It‚Äôs strange that now I‚Äôm exactly where I wanted to be, continued dental issues withstanding. It just takes persistence, when you feel dumb, like you‚Äôre not going to ‚Äòget it‚Äô, you‚Äôre on the right track. The feeling of confusion is the root of learning.   
You have no idea how encouraging your comment is. I‚Äôve completed the first certificate on FCC and have just started the JavaScript. Obviously finding it harder than HTML and CSS. Some days everything makes perfect sense. Other days my brain just won‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm looking at. But I keep plugging away everyday. Eventually the harder bits seem to go in. After I‚Äôve read about it on three different sites! Had Wes Bos‚Äô JS 30 challenges lined up to do at some point too. Thanks for the encouragement.   
I would recommend looking at this bundle it's damn cheap and has some great books about programming in general, as well on some different languages.  
I watched my dad go from customer service at AT&T to coding at the age of 39 or 40, becoming the top programming analyst in the western region for AT&T (some years back now). With enough self-discipline, passion, and studying you can manage it. Play around with it. Find what exactly you want to do and what will be in demand in the coming years. Do you want to be a  system or application developer? Just go for it, work on sample projects, get familiar with the language and before you know it, you'll be in a new career well before 40. Age be damned!!  
I have a degree in psych and was working as a counselor before realizing it wasn't what I wanted to do. At 26 I'm graduating with a 2 year community college programming degree and have a job lined up at a bank doing database work. I probably could have taught myself most if not all of what I learned in school, but the contacts I've made and the structure of school have made it worth it to me. Depending on how in depth you want to go you could teach yourself a lot  
I am also 34 and currently making a 180 degree career change into software.  As others have said, there are lots of us!  I can't speak to whether you should teach yourself or go back to school.  I chose to go back to school for an MS in Computer Science because in the city in which I live, you pretty much have to have a degree in order to get a good job.  (My area is dominated by stodgy government and defense employers.)  I can, however, speak to some of the challenges you will face should you decide to go back to school. ‚Äã Getting professional experience while in school as an intern, co-op, or even part-time employee has been one of my biggest challenges and it's one that I haven't solved yet.  Because I am not a traditional student, going full-time doesn't make sense for me because I don't want to pay for courses that I don't need.  (My program allows me to take undergraduate prerequisites and then transfer into the MS program.)  Unfortunately, almost all of the internship postings I see require that you be a full-time student.  The ones that don't often disqualify people who already have degrees, even if the degree is in an unrelated field.  Instead, I spend more time working on personal projects than other students, but this is going to put me behind the ball when I start the MS program and am full-time.    ‚Äã The last thing I have to say, is that it's worth doing.  I am still on my journey to a new career, but I am happier and more fulfilled than I have been in years.  Good luck!  
The way I see it, you're gonna be 50 either way if you don't die. Do you want to be a 50 year old programmer or a 50 year old mailman?  
I (48M, 2 AA degress in completely unrelated fields) would not recommend wasting time/money on a CS degree.  I've been a full time professional software engineer for just over 18 years now at 5 different companies.  I've worked with a LOT of other engineers.  Very few of them had CS degrees and none of them were/are any more competent than the rest of us at the day to day tasks of writing software.  In fact, many of those with CS degrees are, IMO, less competent because they frequently seem to find unnecessarily complex solutions to relatively simple problems.  They seem to need to justify they're expensive education by building the software equivalent to Rube Goldberg machines.   My advice: 1) Read, read, read.  Staying up to date in this field is a constantly moving target. You'll never finish, so might as well get in the habit now.  The good news is that, whatever the next big thing in software development will be 10 years from now, nobody's even heard of it yet, so you're not that far behind the rest of us. 2) If you live in an area that has meetups for developers, start going to those.  Most of what anybody says is going to go over your head for now, but that's ok.  Listen and absorb. Start networking.  Ask around about good books to read or online tutorials to take.  Listen, listen, listen. However, don't let anybody evangelize or push you down *their* path.  You can certainly try their path if you want, and it might even be a good idea as they'll likely be very willing to help and answer questions, but at this stage, you should be trying lots of paths. Don't let yourself get pigeon holed. 3) Start writing code. NOW.  Think of simple problems that you could solve with software, and then figure it out.   If you find you've picked something that's too complicated for you, break it down into smaller chunks and solve those individually, and if necessary, break the chunks into chunks. Can't think of anything?  Look at some software (or a website, if you're interested in web development) you already use, and pick out a very tiny feature that interests you, and try to recreate it (or something like it). But start *SIMPLE*!  4) Programming languages are, for the most part, just dialects of the same language.  Some are more different from each other than others, but they all share a LOT of common structures.  When first starting out, it's those common structures you need to learn, so it doesn't matter one iota what language you pick.  Pick something that's convenient for you, and as soon as you get comfortable with it, try something different. 5) Learn to do the basics in git.  As even a junior dev, you should be able to create a new code repository and clone existing repositories, add commits (with descriptive commit messages), create branches, merge branches back into master, pull changes from the remote repository, push your changes to the remote repository, and resolve merge conflicts.  Not all employers are going to use git, but a LOT of them will, and they ALL will use some form of version control, so learning one very popular/common one will be a huge leg up to getting a job.  6) Get a github account and start posting your code from #3 to it (did I mention you should learn git?).  When I'm reviewing new candidates, I spend very little time looking over their resume, and a lot of time reviewing the code they've posted on github (so your resume should just link right to your github account).  I really don't care what you say you've done.  I want to see what you've actually done.  The things I'm looking for are, a) Do they give good descriptive meaningful names to classes/modules, methods/functions & variables?  b)  Do their classes & methods do *one thing*? c) Do they recognize when a class or method is getting too big (probably doing more than *one thing*) and break it into smaller classes/methods (with good descriptive meaningful names), or do they just make the mess bigger? d) Are they writing adequate automated tests for their code?  e) Are they solving problems elegantly, or are they making even simple problems look complex? f) Are their commit messages descriptive? 7) Consider taking a bootcamp, but be very wary.  A lot of them are the software engineering equivalent of puppy-mills and just want your money and won't actually teach you the skills you'll need to succeed in a job.  It's the wild, wild, west of snake-oil out there right now.  Do your research. Ask around at the meetups from #2. 8) See #1.  
I think everyone covered the technical side here pretty well; age truly does not matter. Its all in how you handle the challenges of the field, its the same battle for everyone in that regard. Age does matter in terms of cultural fit though. That is to say that some older folks I've interviewed (new engineers in their late 40s) don't jive well with the 20-35 crowd of the rest of the team. Competent boot camp grads that I've turned away because they don't fit with the team; their age creates a culture gap that's tough to bridge.  They don't know "internet culture", they prefer phone calls to texts, they suck at chat and video etiquette (slack, skype, zoom etc.). They have a tough time relating to water cooler conversations. Don't forget the soft skills in your interviews and daily dealings.  Know how to talk with the rest of your team, understand the tools and culture they are a part of (this is even more critical if you are a remote worker). You'll go much further and the teams you are a part of will be much more willing to help you succeed rather than seeing you as that weird old guy that talks about his first flip phone in the 90s.  A note for managers or leaders switching careers to engineering and a single contributor role. Swallow your pride, learn from that 29yr old and don't talk to him him like your kids. He'll move the needle your engineering career with the amount information and experience he can relate to you.  
Formal schooling depends on where you plan on working - some might care/require it and others might not. I would suggest not spending the time and money going to a university or college just for a piece of paper (maybe do it later if you want that for yourself). Every site that someone mentioned here, go there, watch videos, take tests, and learn. Scour stackoverflow.com and github.com for questions and code that fits with where you are aiming (it appears to be java related). Don't try to learn everything. You need to be really good at one thing to get your foot in the door and to be able to market yourself. Look for user groups, meetups, and conferences. Get out there and meet people that do what you want to do. It is a GREAT way to get that first interview. If you don't have work experience, be prepared to bring/show code that you've written and talk through all of it in an interview. Most importantly, be prepared to start at the bottom of the industry and work your way up. The more drive you have the quicker it will be. Secondly, software (and technology) is ALWAYS changing. It's impossible to know everything and just a couple of years being stagnant can make you a dinosaur. Be prepared to learn throughout your whole career.  
The struggle will be mostly psychological. You'll be learning things that other have been learning at 16, 18, or later in their 20s. Your instructors might be 24. Your interviewers or first manager 26.  I think age doesn't matter. But some peoples ego is too fragile and they can't take it. Their loss. If my boss is half my age and she inspires me, grows my knowledge, and I am treated with respect, that's all I need.   
I've never commented on Reddit before, but you need to know that it is totally doable. I taught elementary school for almost ten years before quitting at 37 to go back to school. My original degree was in history. I studied CS for one year as a full-time student (going to college as an adult was a trip) before being hired by my current employer as a QA tester. Part-time school in a traditional university wasn't feasible, so I transferred to Western Governors' University and finished the remaining 80 credits of my Software Development degree in 15 months. Now I'm working as a software engineer, and I love it. The market is wide open. You can do this.  
The dirty secret of programming is how well you understand  how computers actually work, and how little formal mathematics makes a difference, whereas understanding how math and logic work does.  I personally recommend Grokking Algorithms; it‚Äôs Python, not Java, but the concepts travel well. Beyond that, all anyone wants to know is what‚Äôs standard: can you work with people, and can you get things done when asked? Being involved with any open source project at all is helpful, but even try writing a program to calculate a better delivery route for yourself, get an account on GitHub and put it up. Programming right now is the new bricklaying, but when cities are new and everyone has money. It‚Äôs not hard to get an entry-level job if you can demonstrate the basic skills, but if you want a real career you‚Äôll need to show why you‚Äôre at least average (because there are a lot of people below average competing for the same job).  
I hire programmers including entry-level.  There are only two things that matter: commitment and ability. Commitment can be demonstrated with a degree but personal projects work just as well. I need to see that you are spending the time necessary to improve your skills, continuing to learn and challenge yourself.  I don't care if programming is your passion or not, it just takes a lot of time to learn and improve.  I want to see a series of projects that demonstrate your progress.  This means multiple projects beyond tutorials or school/bootcamp projects.  People tend to stall out after school/boot camp and can't think of what to do next.  I can only suggest that you look for a real-world problem and build an app to solve it.  I need to see at least one project that is 100% your idea, design, and work.   Ability is tested.  We ask a few math/logic questions then a series of programming challenges.  For entry-level positions it takes less than one hour.  You can get almost full credit for a question even if you get the answer wrong.  We need to see how you think, how you solve problems.  Getting it right on the first try isn't as important as using a good problem-solving methodology.  And every question has multiple ways of solving it.  There are two ways to do well on the ability test.  One is that you have strong math and logic skills and can solve problems that you have never seen before.  The other is that you have a good memory and have built a "bag of tricks".  That is, you have remembered solutions to these common challenges.  The latter requires a lot of time and experience. The main challenge for someone cross-training to programming is that it requires significant time to become proficient even to an entry-level degree.  You will be competing with people who have been programming since they were kids.  People who have an inherent knack for understanding complex problems or who have spent enough time building their bag of tricks to solve the problems they encounter.  I expect that most people need at least two years of consistent progress in order to meet our entry-level requirements. Best of luck!  
Don‚Äôt worry about your age, if you put your mind to it you can do it and become the programmer out there.  
Instead of saying that you have an up hill bake ahead of you, I would say that you have a highly rewarding adventure ahead of you. Don't worry about age, jump in. Find people and resources that can you get to where you want to be.   
Not much  Like learning any new language it takes time practice and patience Good luck! There are so many tutorials and videos out there to help guide you. Use them!  
The biggest uphill battle is yourself! You can do it! Good luck üôåüèª  
I must save this precious thread   
It's really about how hard you're willing to work.  Just start learning and worry about the rest later.   
Hey man, I don‚Äôt have a Bachelor‚Äôs (I only recently got my associates from a community college I‚Äôve been going to on and off for like 5 years cuz I‚Äôve been working and making money) and I got my foot in the industry at 17. I‚Äôm only 23 now. You have way more life experience than I do. I think if you teach yourself and watch YouTube videos and shit like that you can do what I did. You just gotta be sort of obsessed with your goal and work on it all day if you have to. Wishing you the best of luck man.   
In my opinion and from what I've read age doesn't matter at all. The important factors are: 1) do you have the focus/patience to sit at a computer for many hours a day to learn and continually improve 2) are you pretty good with logic and pick up math concepts easily If it's a yes to both, then I say you won't have too much of a problem. But like anything in life, to get proficient at something you need to learn to love it and put everything you've got into it. Cheers!   
Right around the same age I decided to switch careers.  I used some military benefits and was able to get a bachelor's and eventually a developer job.  It took a few years for various reasons (I kept working and school projects messed up a lot of weekends) but life is much better now.   One big advantage I think I had for the junior-level jobs was I already had an established work history and life experience.  They could see I can function working with other people etc etc.  My classes all used Java, I thought the interview would use C#, and when I took the technical part it was actually visual basic.  I knew the approaches I wanted to take to solve the problems, was just a matter of googling the syntax.   I am just some normal random dude on the internet.  And if some normal random dude on the internet can do it, so can you!  
I‚Äôm 33 took a bootcamp, got a full time job, got a raise, needed to move, job recommended I work remote üòÆ in 5 days it will be a year since I start the bootcamp  
Others have recommended good sites to continue what you're doing, intro learning. As far as making the jump to career, I can't recommend a GOOD bootcamp enough. Three years ago I was living in my parents garage, literally flipping burgers as a line cook. Had some interest in programming and had dabbled w/free stuff online. Discovered bootcamps, went with Hack Reactor Remote, have been in the field now for almost 2.5 years and make six-figures doing a stimulating job I enjoy. I cannot overstate how personally transformative it was for me. Literally feels like I used some kind of real world cheat code. Edit: FWIW I was 31 when I started.  
I'm 32, I took nothing but free online courses. I used meet up to rub some shoulders and make new friends. It took me a hot minute, but I'm now on a team that develops software for IBM servers. You can do it, just embrace the suck for the time being  
Hey there! It's not as bad as you think! I went back to college at age 46. No math whatsoever. I started in summer school and took 3 math classes just to meet the prerequisites for CS. I took Algebra, Geometry, and trigonometry.  Boom. Caught up.  I thought I was bad at math but apparently I never tried hard enough. Math is learned for most rather than a natural talent.  I went on to take Calc 1,2,3, Physics 1&2, statistics, ODEs, and discrete math. I succeeded by going to TA hours and at times, hiring a math tutor. Ask for help! Math is so doable. As for programming classes, they are fun. Often times very challenging. But form study groups. Friends helped a lot. And I also helped friends a lot.  I became a TA for beginning programming classes once I had a few classes under my belt. No better way to learn than to teach.  Seriously. Every class I was a TA for only helped me get better. Graduated at 50 from a top Engineering school .  Got multiple job offers before I even graduated. I was making top.dollar upon graduation (in 2014).  Got my graduate's degree in CS 2 years later...and my employer paid for it!  Trust me, I was an average student all my life. But this degree made me study. I graduated with a 3.6 for my BS and a 4.0 for my MS.  You can do this!! And it's sooooo worth it!  
There are 1000's of them already AND I would be 100% interested. Every site has a different teaching style, and I learn new and different things every time I visit a new place. It's entirely possible that your unique teaching style may resonate with a niche group of learners who have been struggling elsewhere.  
I'm right here with you. I think there's room for teaching almost anything *better*.  Especially with programming.   Something I personally haven't seen, and would LOVE, would be one that teaches, and explains differences from C to C++ to C#.  
C and C++ are both native languages. They do not require that much to run on most systems. C# is like a .net language, which requires dependencies to run on a system. Have you ever had to download a .net framework? That's because it's a dependency for a program you are running  
Thanks, but I meant in terms of syntax.  I learned C#, kinda, so I could get into game programming in Unity.  I'd like to know how much that translates into C/CPP. Maybe that's an idea for OP, if he knows all three - to create a C master class, which encompasses all three, or even also Objective-C (forgive me if that's not the same).  I don't know if that would be a good thing, or if they are so different that it would just be too confusing and better to focus on just one? See - there's already a need.  I need to learn all of THAT!  
I was wondering this too..  I want to get into game programming soon but still see some prefer C++ or C#. It would be interesting to see the difference in term of syntax in other "C" or even in other "same" type of language ? Or even better what C should be Choose in different situation ? (For a program, automatisation, engine etc...)  
And none of them are any good. Every C++ tutorial site I've ever seen has been riddled with basic mistakes.  I try to pretend there aren't actually people reading this stuff and thinking they are learning something.  
I second this.  I learn some concept from A website, some from B website and other from C website. Why? Because A website explain some concept better than B or C; sometimes B website explain better than A and C; and same goes to C. So /u/InsaneTeemo , go ahead! I will watch your career with great interest.  
 or would i just be making something that hundreds of other people are already doing?  It would, but that's shouldn't be a reason to avoid doing this. We re-invent the wheel a lot as we learn. I'd say if you want to do this, do it for your own edification. Maybe you will have a teaching method that's truly different and changes things. Probably not; everyone thinks that their idea is different. But you should still try if you want. Just don't be disappointed if you're the only visitor to your site.  
Doing it for myself is a good idea. I kind of just wanted to teach it, as teaching is a good way to see how well you understand things yourself, and see what areas you need to learn more about.  
Things improve if you do have an actual audience that reads it and gives you feedback.  It's work to aim stuff at a total beginner, and even if you get good at that, it's so tiring that you often don't get to the advanced stuff.  And if you get to the advanced stuff quickly, you probably miss too much of the introductory stuff. Source: Have taught intro programming  
[deleted]  
Great answer. Also OP relate it  metophorically to objects people understand from real life I find this helps people grasp the concepts faster.  
Programming is hard, y'all.  
[deleted]  
This is actually a really good break down of what i wish i had when i was beginning. I spent so long frustrated that i didn‚Äôt know an application for all this stuff. If you have any questions about that stuff now chances are i‚Äôd be able to answer them best i could.   
I‚Äôm definitely interested. I know the basics and syntax but it‚Äôs hard for me to break into data structures and algorithms. I haven‚Äôt seen many good guides on making that jump without it being a learning cliff.   
I 100% would be interested  
I second this  
I think you should. C++ isn't really taught by these modern online courses and I feel that is a big mistake. C++ should be the standard IMO.  
That depends on the industry. In the web world my C/++ knowledge has only ever been used recently to debug some Python compilation. I worked with a dude that forked memcached for a proprietary office build. There's just not much call for it on the web unless you use something like libonion. There are better languages to learn from, the granular memory management of C/++ isn't a big deal with modern languages (imo, YMMV), and it's not huge in startup culture. If those aren't important, using C/++ might be worth it.  
Yes 100%. I'm a CS student and feel like my main resources are the textbook, lecture notes, and stack overflow which is just depressing to go on.  
FINALLY someone else who knows how utterly depressing that site is!  
Yeah, I try googling an error I get, honestly trying to look for ways to better my code and its just so many people on SO telling OP how they're an idiot and how they should go back to the basics if they can't understand this concept. It's seriously such a toxic website. If you're there to help, then help. Don't bring such negativity into it.   
Gatekeeping snobs. They act like they've never struggled with anything  
I remember a classmate saying to me once, ‚ÄúBeing a CS student has made me a professional googler.‚Äù  I don‚Äôt want to defend SO‚Äôs negativity, but one thing I can say as someone who has used Stack sites for many years: those communities see the same beginner questions asked very frequently. The frustrating thing is, those beginner questions have already been answered multiple times. Part of learning to program nowadays is googling your question a few different ways. You‚Äôll likely find a detailed and upvoted solution from 8-9 years ago on StackOverflow. A big part of the learning curve is figuring out which Stack search result contains the actual solution to your question. Sometimes the answers are so good and so detailed, they teach you more than your textbook or professor. So a lot of the negativity is directed toward beginners who neglected all the great search results and asked their question anyway. But programming communities everywhere online are pretty hostile to beginners, even Reddit.

Thirding, mostly because I'm stuck in intermediary limbo.   Of course, I'd be just as happy for C++; the biggest thing for me (personally) is a good program that will fill the void between beginner and way to bloody advanced.   
This  
Yes, a focus on advanced concepts would be nice.  
The advanced concepts is really the big thing I feel is missing in a lot of courses. A bridge between here is this algorithm to if you want to do x then start by doing a, b, and c   
I would be interested if it will also teach tooling, ecosystem, and other stuff that would get one to a production-ready app/library.  
‚òùÔ∏èthis.  
I‚Äôm picking up cpp right now, I‚Äôd love to check it out!   
[deleted]  
What is a good resource on learning C++ (most modern one). Like one that explains things properly. A lot of these guides just throw information at you, I want things explained by saying which problem a certain method solves (like what happens if you were to not do it that way).  
I wrote that and I still believe it. Stick to the recommended books. :)  
100% worth, if you can put everything in laymans terms. Too many people ‚Äúteach‚Äù programming, but use so much jargon that it just scares people away. I can‚Äôt imagine how many EE/CE students you would help.  
Hey , I'm a c++ developer and I want to contribute to that!  
Definitely do it, even if there are hundreds of other resources already. I know when I'm trying to understand a concept, I might go through a dozen websites before I find one that explains it in a way that makes it click. You might have a unique example or method of explanation that might help someone bridge the gap where others couldn't.   
Id look at it  
I hate these asking permission to do things posts. This isn't content, this is asking if it's okay to make content. Just go do the bloody thing and post about it when you're done.  
I think it would be great!  
I would most certainly use it  
I'd be interested!  
Yes!!!!!!!  
Go for it! I for one am interested in visiting the site.   
Yes please. Count me in.  
Yes I would read your site.  
Yes. And I want to see all the ways to 'do' something with discussion of their pros & cons. For example, write to screen. Show as many ways as possible, put a star around the most 'popular' method. The worst tutorials are the ones that treat one way to do something as the only way without even bringing up other methods. More often than not people are going to be reading existing code and fixing it before going off and writing their own stuff from scratch.  Second, I would focus first on tools like clang-format and show how to use it so that all of your code has 100% consistent formatting.  https://engineering.mongodb.com/post/succeeding-with-clangformat-part-1-pitfalls-and-planning  
I would be 100% down.  
Another vote for yes.   
Absolutely interested!   
Yes!!  
Great idea .. here's a student willing to learn from you sir. Can you pm me if  the project comes to see light one day ? Thank you and good luck.  
Regardless of how many people are doing it. Each site provides a little but different. When I look to learn something sometimes siteA gives me a good starting point but siteB spoke to me in a way that makes me retain a process.   
I would love to. Many times what happens for me is, I search bits and pieces and later try to put them together and it's such a mess or I visit websites like Codecademy and while they teach you something.. they don't really give you an example of how to use that knowledge in a real situation... and you kind of fall into your own thoughts and try to create a problem to which you are going to apply the answer that you just learned. To me, it doesn't feel like an obtained knowledge, if I don't know how to use it in practice.  
I'm absolutely gun-ho about this, been trying to wrap my head around C++ for a while now but I've just never worked up the enthusiasm yet  
Same. Current resources seem pretty all over the place rather than fundamentally cohesive to help users  build a structured understanding they can expand from.  
Do it dude I would be interested  
I'd definitely like to learn and see another person's take on it, especially if it actually helped me understand and explained it well!   
That would be awesome. It is going to be a time consuming project though.  
Yes, please.  
Absolutely.  I'm trying to learn it via Udemy courses and they just jump too deep too fast.   
Yes  
Obviously a lot of support for your idea! In trying, as a much older person, to master the basics of programming, I have consistently noticed that most online courses whiz through the basics, and don‚Äôt have enough practice. Perhaps programmers, like many experts, are not always the best teachers. Those of us who struggle with the material and concepts could make better instructors, because we wouldn‚Äôt lose our learner audience by jumping ahead too quickly.  
100% would be interested!!   
Usually I get frustrated by the programing resources provided online. If you can teach from the basic to how it is applied and so on, I'm in. Also, let us know (I don't know how but just saying) when you are done with making the website.    ‚Äã ‚Äã  
There is 1000's of them already  
So recommend smth nice please  
It would be a great idea. If you make it look good and if there will be many language. I think that meny people would use it.   
As you've already recognised, loads of people do this course already. But that shouldn't deter you - your method of teaching may resonate with some people really well, and it will help you solidify what you know.  
Well i think it's great idea, especially if you will study people work not only with c++ syntax but and with some frameworks(for example QT)  
My main issue with pre-existing tuts is that once you learn something once they assume you have it memorized. Maybe something you can do to stand out is reiterate when necessary, or provide links to earlier lessons when they will need to be applied?  
Your target demographics will most likely be CS students as C++ is taught at many universities. If you could wiki style "The C++ programming language" book, it would be pretty sweet.   
Depends on the method but yes sounds good.  
!remindme 2 months  
I always found myself happiest and most secure in what I knew when I was passing it on to others. I reckon you should go for it. I need to brush up on my coding too, I've been out of the game for over ten years now. Go on and make your website, then tell me where to go.  
Pls i really need it. Can you you DM me or something if it works out?   
Learning c++ and I realize I'm on the struggle bus. Man, this stuff is kicking my butt. Haha. So, and help would be awesome. (‚òûÔæü„ÉÆÔæü)‚òû  
open source it  
I would 100% be interested. Please let me know if this does go ahead as I think it would be awesome.  
Yes I certainly would.  
Yep that will be amazing !  
I‚Äôll help fund it.   
I would be heavily interested! I've tried to learn in college but I find the teaching methods to be not very good and I often had nothing to show for my effort. I was never alone as most of the time 50% of the class dropped within a couple weeks  
I think it would be a great idea.   As you said most of the resources just teach the basics but worse than that they don't really focus as much on some of the more difficult to understand but important aspects such as recursion, pointers, exception handling, advanced memory allocation.   The biggest thing I don't see a big focus on RAII and the STL.   They teach them but not really in depth or in a method that people understand just how important they are.   
yeah I doubt anyone's gonna tell you no  
That would be awesome! A lot of site go only from beginner to intermediate or are just advanced.  
Yes and you should give students a lot of project opportunities. Maybe you can also have further classes that use c++ in specialized ways, like for Econ, math, stat, fin, etc  
Did you learn in this manner? If so, do you remember going through the tutorials and something went wrong (while setting up tools/environments/some important step), but the tutorial just plowed along without any indication that something might go wrong?  If so, please keep that in mind. Try to remember where things went wrong for you, or where you think they could go wrong for others. Try to address those. If this happens, try this or that. If those don‚Äôt work, check google for blah blah then come back. Too many tutorials just assume everything will work flawlessly right away. Either that or they just assume someone the type of audience who is interest in ‚Äúthe very basics of xyz‚Äù will know exactly what went wrong and how to fix it  That said, you should do it anyway. Maybe you‚Äôll help 100000 people or maybe just 1. But if you put just one person on the right path that‚Äôs worth it right?   
 However, I feel like a lot of online resources just teach you the basics over and over again, and very few of them actually move on to more advanced concepts or help the readers understand where to go from there.  I think most places do go on to advanced features, but pretty much all of them introduce features in isolated cases. If you could figure out a bigger project which you gradually build by introducing more advanced features and/or replace the "worse" ways of doing things with better methods, it would help a lot of people.   
I'll be very much interested in this.  
Yeah - I‚Äôd love it. I do some c++, but I‚Äôm a hack. I‚Äôd love to start from scratch and eliminate my bad habits and lack of understanding in some spots. Thanks.   
No  
YES PLEASE ABSOLUTLEY.  
It already exists my bro... Microsoft virtual academy  
I agree, I've gone through a few college courses on C++, and every time, just as I'm getting the hang of the basics, the course ends and I have to start all over with C#.  
This would certainly help me, I've just started learning about a month ago.  
Yes  
Yes  
I'm definitely interested in intermediate and advanced c++ content.  
I‚Äôm interested especially if you are going to dive into more than the basics I‚Äôve seen over and over ad nauseam.    
Quite honestly there are plenty of ressources like that for complete beginner, but whats harder to find is what to do after all the basic stuff, I think you should focuse on that. Like for example more complexe memory management.  
Yes please. I haven't been able to get my head around c++ yet.  
 there are already hundreds of resources that do this same thing  It depends. There are hundreds of resources that teach things up to: Here is a class. It is an apple. It is derived from the class fruit. But if you really go into the advanced concepts, far beyond just what is a class, there really aren't that many resources. Most just touch on advanced concepts and either quit or say, if you want the really good info, now you have to pay. I would love a good course in C++ that assumes you know what a class is (the very basics) and goes from there.  
You are pretty much right . I shifted from c++ to python because no tutorials were helping me the basics as well as the advanced topics. It would be pretty cool if u would initiate this. Many friends of mine are facing the same dilemma.   
I'd love to know what you plan teaching. I'd love some C++ tutorial where you build something that's "useful".  My main difficulty with learning C++ compared to other languages is that because of its nature of being a multi purpose language, I can't get to build something useful like I would in Java, C# or Golang. If I was to boil down my feedback, I'd say id like to see a tutorial teaching us how to use a specific C library. Writing code from scratch just feels like it doesn't teach much, especially when youve learned fundamentals through another language  
Id be great if we can get a c++ version of helsinkis Java course. Something similar.  
I would! I‚Äôve read a few things and it says to start with something simpler so I‚Äôm thinking about learning python first but I don‚Äôt know.   
Yup  
Yes, definitely. I've been wanting to learn c++ for a while now. This would be awesome!  
Yes please.  
Yes please  
Do it! That's an awesome idea!  
This'll probably get lost in the huge amount of comments but I'd be interested. When I started coding I started with free code camp, which everyone suggested but as I have a STEM background I wanted to do "proper" coding not web dev. I wanted to start to learn with C++ but I just couldn't find enough resources to take me from beginner to the point that I could start my own projects. I ended up starting with Python because there was the available resources. I'd be willing to help out on the non-technical side if you do need help.  
Yes please!  
This is coming from someone who likes people to succeed, and tried learning c# at age 30. Multiple times.  The key here, is that not only young people are going to take your courses. Older people will too. Older people literally cannot learn like younger people. Especially with the ambiguous nature of code or language in general. Learning a new language is hard.  I would suggest not only a lecture/try it on your own approach, but visual aids to illustrate common concepts in coding. Variables, arrays, addressing memory, etc are tough concepts if you can't find a way to visualize them on your own. There are also a lot of buzzwords in coding lingo that will go straight over someones head if they havent used them (e.g. concatenate).  I dont know. I tried several methods for learning and just got overwhelmed every time. I would get the basics down pretty solid, but then would try to build something on my own and get completely lost because my syntax wasn't 100% correct, or my understanding of the lesson I just watched vs the practical application weren't congruent. Then you just find yourself copying someone elses work to make it work and that isn't rewarding.  TL;DR I would say if you really want to do it, and want to do it well, you need to find a method of teaching that will reach people who are teaching impaired by age. Visual aids to illustrate functions, and analogies to real world common applications are the way to go. Dumb it way down and find a way for people to associate things they understand to the process of coding an application.  You will be a millionaire.   
As someone that's interested in learning coding, I think that would be a cool idea.  
I'd pay good money for this if its good.  
I'd say C++ would be a much to deep and complex starter.  C#, Python, are much more beneficial because you more quickly get to meaningful artifacts. What would make your site different than the 1000's already out there?  
I‚Äôm asian and I only learn A++  
Me  
Yes.  
I took a basic programming course, but it didn't really stick. I'd love to try learning programming in my spare time.  
Something that I feel like a lot of learning websites do is they tell you how to do something, but not how to use it. Your website would automatically be better then the tons of others out there if you did that.  
Yes, I would use it alot  
I would absolutely use this website. I have never tried coding in my life, but I enjoy working with computers and really want to learn. Finding recourses has been difficult for me because there seems to be so many different softwares and things to learn, I wish there was a place that can make sense of all the information that's out there. At the very least, if you made the site I would visit!  
Go for it no harm in it and your probably helping people get people into programming as well as other people getting into c++  
I'd definitely be interested in it.   
I keep seeing related threads like this asking about C++ resources. Is there a particular reason people don't use the C++ tutorial, http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/?  
Would anyone be interested in free blowjobs, without fear of stds?  
yea. Im looking into getting into  programming. Would love to be involved. Message me   
YES!!   
Yes, this would be amazing! I agree, a lot of sites start with HTML and/or Ruby. I think this would be especially great for someone who understands the basics of programming but wants to learn another language.  
I‚Äôm down. I‚Äôm currently taking a c++ class and its some topics are confusing.:/  
Adding my two cents. Things I see websites that try to teach fail at the easy things. Like a list of ‚Äúthis is what you need to get started‚Äù.   
Me!!!  
I would love to learn the language without having to switch sites all the time trying to go the next step. Course A thru Z and have the basis would be perfect.   
If you do that, bear in mind that many people don't understand someone's explanations, but maybe from someone else they do. There are a lot of websites out there, like codecademy, that explains stuff even for beginners pretty good.  
for free?  
I think it would be fantastic! I say were do I sign up?  
I would be interested. Majority of the resources say they will make you an expert but they only teach basic programming.  I‚Äôve been trying to learn C++ but can‚Äôt find a good resource.   
Yes, remind me when it's available  
Although you may be correct that a lot of online resources already cover beginner topics, what I always feel is lacking in intro and intermediate courses is exercises. They usually take you through a single project to build along with them, but never exercises to work through yourself. Think about maths textbooks. They‚Äôre always littered with endless exercises for each chapter/topic, usually with final solutions at the end. I think that approach is never really taken in teaching programming; and it could be very  beneficial for beginners. Practice makes perfect.  
I'm interested.   
I would!  
I would definitely be interested in that! Never checked out online before but would like to learn c++ and other programming languages but never knew where to start where it doesn't cost money.   
Yes  
sign me up!  
YES  
1  
Count me in, please.  
yes  
This post has a lot of comments but I just wanted to add my 2 cents. If you can create a website that teaches C++ in a way that challenges the viewers, that would be awesome. There are WAYYY too many shitty tutorials out there. A tutorial where some guy writes the code for you and leaves a copy of the code at the bottom of the page IS NOT HELPFUL. I need to be shown basic concepts and then challenges to create something with those concepts building on what I‚Äôve already learned.   
If you can, please let me know when this is up. I am very interested.  
Comp Sci student, can confirm, am interested.  
how much does it pay ?  
Yes!! if you could I would suggest starting on more advanced concepts first (for example maybe starting at a level like pointers would be nice) because many courses teach the basics but no the most advanced concepts  
üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
I would be interested.  
Please do, I'd love to get some experience on advanced concepts!   
I keep thinking about doing the same thing for Java. Sure, there are perhaps hundreds of websites about Java. But most of them are "about Java" rather than actually teaching what you really need to understand about Java.  ‚Äã I think you should only do it if: A) You think you truly understand how to "think like C++ thinks." B) You are really good at explaining this. Not just repeating the standard line about what to type to get something to happen. C) You are really good at organizing your thoughts so that what you are explaining now never depends on something you haven't explained yet. This is especially hard to do with CS. If you ever have to say, "You will understand this better after I explain X," then you have things in the wrong order. I have read FAR too many programming books that were written almost exactly backwards. D) You remember what it was like to not know things. Too many books, written by experts, seem to assume you know by heart every single other thing about the whole subject other than what they are covering in that one paragraph. They make references to things that only an expert would know. It is maddening. E) You are more interested in teaching than merely filling pages with content.  
100% absolutely !!   
As someone who just started learning to program about a week ago, I would love to have more resources to learn with!  
Go for it. Update us with a link!!  
I would definitely use your site as a tool for learning  
Yes! Absolutely.  
Would it cost money?  
Just don't end up going CarlH on us.  
Would consider it.   
I am interested.  
Sounds like you can make some money off this model if you create it properly.  
It will be cool.  
Let me know if you need help making it.. I'll volunteer happily  
Could you complement the site with videos I think there are explanations ar easier to understand with spoken explanations   
Thanks man! I really appreciate your effort to give a whole course out for free and a reduced price. I'm definitely going to use this

man ima do it i been putting this off for too long :(  
The effort alone you go through to give back to the community and find ways to open your content is fantastic.  I wish more curators, in this space specifically, came with this mentality and energy! Thanks Al.  
It's really amazing how tech can act as a force multiplier. I pay about $15 a month for my web host, but tens of thousands of people can read the book on my site. And this doesn't even consider the people behind the Creative Commons license and the Python Software Foundation. Learning to code a little bit lets folks make incredible leaps in productivity.  
Looking to the new version of the book  
Thanks! Went to redeem, and turned out I already bought it. Glad to have paid for it though, such a generous and helpful author from what I've heard. Sent the link to a few friends who may be interested.  Hoping to maybe learn how to maybe make a webscraper for downloading and organizing podcasts and sermons. It's kind of slow to manually do it... Especially when the sites have their own hosting. I wouldn't want to break any rules by downloading all at once and overloading their servers... But even if I added a timer between downloads, that'd still save me time from having to find each link and manually download it.  
Great thanks so will there be a new course on second edition or same course will be updated with second edition content? super thanks for this.  
Eventually yes, probably mid- or late-2020. It won't be a separate course. People who sign up for this course will automatically get the updates once I finish them.  
wohoo great looking forward too infinite thanks from a broken while loop :)  
"You purchased this course on Sept. 22, 2015" OH YEA  
*Mortal Kombat voice* F I N I S H I T  
OH YEAH like rocket racoon in guardians of the galaxy? lol Sorry I couldnt help myself.  
Or Kool aid man bursting through a wall  
Went to use this but it was free without the code...?  
If you check the URL you'll see that the coupon's already applied through the link ( the "?couponCode=NOV2019FREE" after "/automate/").  
Ah that's it thanks!  
Yeah, the algorithm that Udemy uses for when they offer discounts and how much is kept secret. If they offer it for free without the code, then go ahead and sign up anyway. I just checked in my browser's privacy mode (but didn't hide my IP address with a VPN) and I only saw a discount (but not free).  
Helpful!  
This is fantastic! I just started this course this week and was lamenting my timing because I had seen it as free before, I put off buying the course until I was caught up to where I was and I just sat down to start the next chapter. Sorry to hear about the udemy rigamaroll but thank you so much for your work :)  
Thank you so much for this! I wanted to get started on Python and this seems like a perfect way to do so!  
Awesome man! I used the code! Appreciate this and I'm a big fan of yours. I have the first edition of ATBS and I love it. Cant wait for the second edition!  
Awesome, thanks for the course. Will definitely try to finish it. I think people do not finish courses because:  Starting something new gives a hit of dopamine (which is a neurotransmitter released inside the brain in ANTICIPATION of a reward, here the reward might be learning something new). But as soon as there is nothing new to that, people lose motivation and suddenly the course which for which you signed up willingly requires you to spend your will power. ( I might be wrong about dopamine here but this is what I currently understand about it, if someone can recommend a good book, I'd try to increase my understanding) Then comes the phase where we need to use our will to start that new video in the course which will teach the all important loops. But the catch about willpower is, it is limited and we can exhaust it on things that don't matter if we don't use it carefully. One can think of it as a muscle which can be trained slowly and steadily by lifting just enough weights that it won't tear apart but challenge it at the same time. The Willpower Instinct by Kelly McGonigal is a good book to read more about it.  Things people can do to tackle these problems:  Reserve things tha give you a dopamine hit for the time only after you finish one or two videos from the course (or perhaps even a section). For instance, I'll get coffee only after I finish this much. This way your brain will associate this activity of learning to getting a reward and you would love doing it. (Here one thing can go wrong though, we expect too much from ourselves but in reality we cannot do much, so its important to set short goals but the rewards should also be small. Not like feasting yourself with a 7 course meal after just one video :P). Tackling willpower can be tricky and easy at the same time. The best thing that works is building systems like saying "I watch one video first thing in the morning and one video before going to bed". This way doing the course becomes part of our daily routine and we don't have to go out of the way to type Udemy on the browser, then go to My Courses, then by the time we reach this course our phone beeps and the cycle repeats. Going out of the way requires will power. The tricky part here is that most people (including me :P) cannot (or will not) take out 5-10 minutes to just watch one video, but can scroll through YouTube all day. (I developed a habit of reading by reading just before going to bed)  All this information is mixed from these books:  Atomic Habits by James Clear The Willpower Instinct by Kelly McGonigal Deep Work by Cal Newport And YouTube Fill me in if you got more. :D  There is one more thing, which is, while starting due to enormous expectations from ourselves, we fail to accomplish our goals which leads to deterioration of motivation and thus we stop. The important thing here is to start extremely small and build upon only if we can. Otherwise just take baby steps to the finish. After writing all this, I might complete the course after all. Lets see, I'll just put the date here and update this post when I complete it. 5 Nov 2019  
Thanks!  
been teaching myself python for free with sololearn and codecademy and love it.  thanks for your contributions, just enrolled.  so much gratitude!!!  
This is awsome. Thanks!  
Hi guys. I was receiving the error while using Chrome 'Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Programming: NOV2019FREE(A temporary error occured. You have not been charged. Please try again later, or use a different card or payment method.)'  Then, I tried Edge and it worked. (Probs first time Edge did something Chrome couldn't)  
Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Programming: NOV2019FREE(A temporary error occured. You have not been charged. Please try again later, or use a different card or payment method.) RIP  
I just now tried the code (when your comment was marked as "3 minutes ago") and it works, so I think it is a temporary error and you can try again.  
This or CS50 by edX?  
If it's harvardx CS B, that one uses C and is a general introduction course to programming.  
https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x I believe it‚Äôs this one. I‚Äôve taken intro classes before but want to learn again online. Leaning towards the Harvard one as it is more reputable from a resume perspective, which one would you recommend for a noobie programmer to start learning again? This or edx?  
This is the one I did  https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-apr-computer-science-principles-harvardx-cs50-ap I can say that edx has a reddit community called r/cs50 that deals with the programming problems, but I haven't taken either of those courses. And yeah, for $90 bucks you can get some kind of certificate from harvard. The python one seems more workplace oriented and deals with webscraping, automation, and regex. The harvardx one seems similar to the one I took, it goes over general concepts like data structures, algorithms, etc, and also mainly uses C, with a little bit of Python and Web stuff. It's up to you which one, I haven't taken the python one ore the specific harvardx one you're looking at, but I can say that the web parts of the course were my least favorite for harvardx.  
Thank you I am going to check this out. I have no idea about Python as I haven't really seat to learn the language. Currently learning Powershell scripting and everyone at my IT WhatsApp group is telling me Python and Powershell together is dynamite in regards to productivity.  Regarding the part that has been 'edited'. I think is depending more on your individual circumstances, for example, someone buy it for the sake of learning something, may not have the same encouragement in comparison to someone that needs to learn the language because his job will or it depends of learning, so you're forced to complete the course and apply the knowledge right away.  Thank you.  
Signed up :) regarding getting more people to finish the course: I did the CS50 course and was really happy that I could use Reddit for feedback and to see other people's solutions to problems. So having a community/ showcasing (parts of) solutions really was useful.  Stuff like syntax was incredibly frustrating to deal with for beginners (finding where the semicolon is missing), so introducing how to debug early on, and showing how to deal with bugs in the code and how to Google might be useful - it would definitely be for me.  
I think people don‚Äôt finish their courses because it gets repetitive to just watch videos over and over again. I bet if you checked the courses over at edx such as cs50 or sololearn that essentially make the user do something with what they have learned, have higher course completion rates than udemy. Maybe not significant but I would say that‚Äôs definitely a factor. Another one that would make people finish the course is seeing the benefit that it can have besides just learning to code. For example, a testimonial like: ‚ÄúI completed ATBS with Python and 1 month later I got a job as a Python developer‚Äù  Personally, for me, I have to finish this course simply because I‚Äôm pushing myself to do so but not many people are like that.  
Will this be free in the soon future?  
!RemindMe 1 day  
Not Bot but herr I am to remind you  
Thank you!  
Thanks a whole bunch!

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHahahahahhahaaaaa I paid fifty quid for this on 30th Oct...  Just mixin' up the thanks a little... Remember me!  
Thanks  
I really appreciate you sharing this! Thank you!!  
Are there any other courses that this cupon applies to?  
Thanks a lot man  
Thank you for your contribution to educating the world.    You are a great person.  
thank you VERY MUCH <333  
Thanks Al  
Saving  
Thanks! (previously used your PyGame book ;))  
Thank you!  
I just want to think you so much!  
Thank you very much!  
Wow, this is very generous of you to offer the course and book for free. Thank you very much! I just signed up for the course using the code, and will be starting to watch and learn very soon!  
Thank you.  
God's work this. Thanks  
Thank you very much, your an inspiration.  
Wow, that's brilliant - thanks! Really wanted to learn a bit of Python for ages and never got around to it so now's my chance. üòäüòä  
Thanks man, signed up and will give it a whirl.  
Is this a corse for someone with no prior programming knowledge?  
I am one of those dozen of people that have finished your course <3 By the way, Al, do you have any plans to write you own textbook for learning python? Something like python crash course.  
Thank you so much for doing this! I'm really keen to learn python as a beginner but I need something to 'do with it' and this looks like exactly it! Really appreciate it dude  
Thanks for this!  
I just wanted to say how grateful I am that you're doing this. I like to point out that you don't have to do this, yet here you are being a blessing. Thank you so much  
Thanks! Will definitely do the course :)  
Many thanks  
You amazed me.Thanks a lot.  
I recommend your book to my undergraduate students. Thank you for the excellent resource!  
I bought this book along with a few others from humble bundle a few month ago, I'm about to start my journey with python. Thanks  
This is great, I'm working through the book at the moment so this is a big help. Thanks.  
I can't wait to find time to go through this course and then automate all the shit with Python :)) Thank you very much!  
Just signed up! Thank  you.  
I purchased your course in the summer. Great intro to Python programming with useful exercises, explained in a clear and concise manner. It's awesome of you for doing this.  
Thank you! I have the book, but this would be a great supplement to learn.  
Yo, how do I make sure to not miss the next month‚Äôs offer????  
I‚Äôm just going to follow for this good gesture:)  
Cool! Thank you!  
This is awesome! The online book/website for automate the boring stuff with python is routinely in the list of first things i recommend people who want to learn a language. So much of the challenge is figuring out what you can actually do and how coding can be useful. Your book shows the types of things you can do AND is written so a newbie can pick it straight up and learn by example. I strongly recommend, anyone who hasn't gone through this book to do so. It is one of the best resources on the internet.  
Thanks. You're awesome.  
MY MAN!!!  
Thank you!  
Thank you for all your work and generosity!  
Will this course teach me to scrape data from an anti-bot site like StubHub? I was using an extension called ticket flipping toolbox to do that but they're limiting how often we use it.  
Just had our DevOps guy write a script to remove some outdated translations from a slew of CSV files, since my junior FED self was going through and removing them manually...now I can learn to not be so dependent, haha! Thanks for this!  
Thank you Al for the free course. Wonder if Python is the code used for IFTTT?  
You're the MVP! Thank you so much! I'm excited to work on the course!  
this is the best thing I've had today, thank you very much!  
Thanks friend  
It will surely help me and a lot of people, Thanks very much!  
Thank you so much!  
Thank you so much for this opportunity  
Thank you so much!  
Thanks for this mate. üëçüèª  
What a hero!  
Al you're a champ.  
Thanks for this! Currently studying other stuff but glad I can come back and tackle this at my own pace.  
Thanks for the free course dude!  
This is awesome. Was just checking out the book and Udemy course last night. Thank you.  
Been reading through your book on line and just wanted to thank you for all your hard work.  
Thanks man, really appreciate of this  
Thank you! Added to my library!  
You‚Äôre the bees knees!  
Legend man, thank you!!  
You always make me feel shy when you do this. Holy shit man, you're a fucking role model  
Thank you so much!  
Thank you!!  
Thanks from this broke middle aged guy who decided to get back into coding recently. Much appreciated.  
You are the best! Thank you so much! I'm in school for computer science now, but I have absolutely no experience with python. I'm looking forward to diving right into it. Again, thank you!!  
I somehow got it thanks, I won‚Äôt waste it

Al, mate, couldn't have come at a better time. Recently retrenched and trying to switch industries. If you're ever in Perth, I'll buy you a coffee.  
Hey Al. I got your course free a couple years ago and completed it.  Great course and it has made my life easier numerous times because of how I applied it.  Thanks for doing this.  
do i need to have some basics in python before starting this course ?  
Thanks. I appreciate.  
Wow man, this is amazing I always wanted to get into learning python but never felt motivated enough. Maybe this will help me Thanks very much  
Commenting as reminder  
Thanks so much Al!  Your course was in my wishlist.  Am looking forward to it!  
Thank You very much for this.  
MVP  
Al, I already purchased your book and online course a while back. Just wanted to say that you‚Äôre a gem for doing what you do. Thank you for everything!  
Noice  
excellent thanks!  
This is awesome.  I was able to use the free code. Looking forward to this when I have time next year. Thank you very much!  
Thank you kind sir  
thank you  
Hi Al, recent just stumble across your free online book ‚ÄúAutomated the boring stuff‚Äù.  It is really nice and fun to read and follow. I am not at Chapter 2 and was planned to buy your class on Udemy. Since now you have it open as a free course, so I will go for it. Thanks for re-contributing back to the community. You da best hero!  
Already have my copy of the book! Hopefully this will help me get through it fully. I've only just dipped my toes in. Thank you for all you've done.  
Merci beaucoup!  
This is wonderful! I can‚Äôt wait to start!  
Thank you!!! Can‚Äôt believe how perfect this timing was.  
Thanks a lot for this!  
thanks mate instantly reedemed and shared with classmates  
I was learning c++ on my own few years back and lost interest as it was too difficult for me and I got bored (my bad). So I lost the touch of programing itself. Then the python boom came about and the first resource recommended was your book . I was just hooked right from the start as everything you teach were practical application. Which was what I always wanted to do . Now I have been recommending it to many others, they love it too. Thank you for what you are doing! You are a nice man .  
Thank you! Nearing second year BIT student. This will help a lot, thanks!  
Thanks so much dude!!  
Cool thanks man  
Code not working for me üòî‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è  
thank you so much!  
Hay man thank you.  I use udemy as my main learning site. Currently moving from a manual tester to full stack dev ops engineer trying to learn as much as possible. I just completed my 5th course, all of them have been 40 hours plus  so far. This shorter course would keep me well entertained until I am ready to start some angular stuff.  I rrally look forward to seeing what else you have in store  Thanks again i really appreciate it  
Just got this course!  Thank you, AlSweigart  
Wow! Thank you! I use python a little bit in my daily tasks, this course will help me a lot  
Thank you!  
Your 47th link is the same as your 46th, you might want to fix that.  
/u/engineer4free  
Thanks for pointing that out, its fixed now!  
[deleted]  
Yup. Used to be a Reddit gold feature but now it's site-wide for everyone  
[deleted]  
/u/vgman20  
I read that as "I made 47 years of free c++ tutorials" and was like T_T  
Reminds me of this  
Fool got shanked tho  
Which means it never happened.  
Could still take 47 years to complete.  
C++..hmm...yea.. that estimation checks out.  
[deleted]  
Here in my garage, I just bought this computer. It's great for tutoring up here in the Hollywood hills.  
But do you know what I'm more proudy of?  
I only had 47 tutorials in my tutorial account  
Only 47 year accounts in my year account account  
I actually have 47 accounts in my year account count  
I've got 47 years of C++ to complete in my years of C++ to complete account.  
Hey, don't forget to study   
x_x  
sorry we are only hiring devs with 48 years experience looks like we have to offshore to Infosys  
hahahahaha I actually LOL'd when I read that. I would T_T too  
I wanna learn C++, instead I have to write a report on "social, Legal and Health implications of ICT". I am T_T  
Hrrm. Well, at a high school level, that would be in the 'Information Processing & Technology' course for sure, but it would not be in 'Software Design & Development'.  
What does that mean T_T ? Really?  
Crying face   
Ahh thanks  
That would be a real challenge. Development of C started 46 years ago.  
I did some spot checking to evaluate the quality and didn't spot any major problems. But I did notice your first three second and third array videos aren't valid C++ programs. You're using a common language extension, borrowed from C, called variable length arrays (VLA). In C++, array lengths must be a constant integer expression. Your compiler accepts it because it's being nice, but if you ask it to be strict (-pedantic in clang++ and g++), it will reject the program with an error.  
The first video is okay.  The problem starts in the second video, specifically the: int size = 5; double values[size];   
Am I correct in thinking this is only a problem if you're creating an array on the stack and it is fine to do it when the array is heap allocated?  
It's specifically the syntax: type name[size];  Where size must be a constant expression.  With the Variable Length Array (VLA) extension, you may use a non-constant expression iff the array has automatic storage (AKA allocated on the stack.) If you were to heap allocate an array, you'd likely use: type* ptr = malloc(sizeof(type)*size);  Which is completely different syntax, but yes it's valid since sizeof(type)*size is a function argument here, and doesn't need to be a constant expression. Regardless, these are both C constructs where in C++ we havestd::array (if available) and std::vector, which are strictly superior.  
Yeah, there's no reason for the raw C-style arrays.  
Interesting, thanks for pointing that out. I learned originally from "C++ For Everyone" textbook by Horstmann, I should go back and check out what's written in that book.   
Awesome, thank you! Will have to check out the vectors tutorial soon. Had more trouble with that in my CS class than anything else  Edit: Is there a playlist link you can post? Would make it easier to follow the lessons that way   
Hey yeah, the playlist is here https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOAuB8dR35ocZ2YtaGzhJetZqLW2J3s5Z  
I know this is likely a completely newbie question to ask, but what do you type your code into on these videos? Do you have any suggestions on what editor to use?   
The FAQ has a link to the wikis tools page. you should start there.   
thanks, I'll check it out now.   
Yeah that's a great resource. I use Xcode in the videos, but there's tons of compilers out there. I recently came across the online compiler cpp.sh (that's the website) which seems pretty legit if you just want to try out C++ without having to download anything.  
Neither is a compiler.  
I came up the other day with this online compiler called cloud9. Pretty cool because you can host your solutions online with a dedicated CPU power to compile your project. https://c9.io  
For C++ I recommend using Code::Blocks. It's extremely easy to write and compile programs with it (essentially New File -> Something.cpp  -> Write code -> Press F9 -> Your program runs).  
Visual Studio 2015.  It's just nicer to look at than Code Blocks.  I don't think one is inherently more difficult to use than the other one, you just need an installation + setup + Hello World tutorial for whichever one you decide to use.  
If you don't intend to go commercial with your code, I would HIGHLY recommend Visual Studio Express, basically free if your not selling what your making, has really good auto-complete, and probably the single smoothest code-to-exectuable path of any IDE I have ever used.  
Of course.  For me it's VS or nothing.  
CLion is swell.  
You're a clion.  
These videos are also a great resource to check out:  https://www.youtube.com/user/1kingja/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=6 I had this guy as my teacher for a C++ programming class, and he is phenomenal at explaining concepts. If you find yourself stuck on anything in OP's playlist, maybe one of his videos can help you out!  
The more the merrier :)  
I am brand new to programming. I'll give them a go! Thanks!  
From what I see, this teaches you literally everything you will learn from an intro to C++ class, except for maybe structs/classes. Definitely seems like something you should stick to.  
I haven't looked at it,  but the whole purpose of C++ is classes so will those be addressed in future lessons?  
This is it for now, I may add more tutorials in the future.  
Cool, let me know how it goes!  
sooo... just a question... do I need a program to program in C++?  
You need a compiler if you don't have a unix based system like Linux or Mac.  Try codeblocks for windows.  
It's a unix system.  
I'm also in that guys position can you give me/us a super brief but casual summary of what you need and what you can actually do with c++ basic skills and this.... compiler?  At the moment it's like some ancient cook book in latin. I'm up for learning latin and can poach an egg but I wouldn't be able to make a meaningful cook book.  So is c++ visuals or everything? Complete 'noob' had a google and found conflicting and complicated answers just need a kinda yo if you learn some basic c++ you might be able to make a little game or such.  Cheers in advance man.   
I have window is that normally for c++... is codeblocks free?  
So far so good. I'm just watching the first one to see if it seems like it will help me in my 2016 code-learning plan.     I think it will work great. Thanks for putting it together.   
Fucking Mathew is so far ahead of his game. He's like a mattress in a maze of unending dreams  
Dude is fuckin ON IT  
If I already know C++, will it be beneficial to watch these? I am looking for tutorials for something more complex and advanced in C++, which I don't know yet.  
I would think it would never hurt to skim the material. Sometimes even refreshing on thinks like loops and arrays help from time to time.  
looks really cool. i had C++ last year on my Computer Science studys but im going to recommend this to the younger guys from year below. Thank you! P.S. i hope next topic you will cover will be classes.  
That's awesome, please do! I may add more C++ tutorials in the future.  
Yes.  When people say something like "paging /u/excaliboor ", that is actually what they are doing.  As you can see from this comment.  
Looks great, I am adding them to my to-do list :) definitely will watch them  
Awesome, I hope you eventually do!  
I already know some C++, but as this made me discover your calculus videos, I wanted to give you a shout-out anyway. Going to spend some time watching them!  
Thanks! Good luck in calculus :)  
Bring it to next level and introduce OOP and tamplates. Great job! You can never have enough of beginner-aimed lessons.  
Thank you so much!  
Cool. Thanks  
Thank you, I love you...  
I love you too...  
Great tutorial! Last link though takes me to typedef and not passing vectors into functions. Thanks!  
Thanks, for letting me know, I fixed the link!  
These are great thank you for doing these.  
I was eager to learn C++ in my uni break, you just made my life a lot easier.  Thank you very much.  
Glad to hear it, you should be pretty well off next semester if you do!  
As someone from an entirely different field, at a basic level, what can I practically do by learning c++ ?  
C++ is a systems programming language, meaning you can do about anything except web development with it. It is also one of the most powerful languages, meaning it is commonly used in the real world to do things that require up most performance, such as AAA video games (Call of Duty, Bioshock, The Elder Scrolls etc) or large bank systems. At a basic level, you could just create gimmicky text based games to impress you friends :P  
Just what I needed, Thank you!  
Welcome :)  
just in time for the Christmas break, thank you  
thank you  
I love you  
I love you too  
would surely help me with my course, thanks :)  
Thank you very much for your effort! I've been meaning to get into C++ for some time now, will certainly check out your tutorial.   
doooo it, no excuse now!  
RemindMe 40 days   
shit man looked at a few before getting my thoughts your voice is really clear and nice to listen to, your mic isn't bad. Bookmarked this for future learning. It's so hard finding someone who teaches nicely who has a good voice and mic!  
Thanks for the feedback! I tried a headset once but it felt like I was in a call center, so I just go with my built-in macbook mic. Glad to hear it's working!  
It still sounds great. No feedback or annoying sounds from it. Keep it up!  
The topic "Find the max or min of a value" embeds the "Filling arrays with a loop" video  
Thanks for pointing that out, it's fixed now!  
wooo!! thank youuuuuuuu!! i just had 2 eight weeks courses on programming fundamentals & i didn't get the full explanation on everything.  
hahaha enthusiasm! Hopefully these tuts can patch any gaps!  
Awesome, watched the first 13, think I will try to watch the rest in the next couple of days. :)  
I watched these videos especially because I am interested in watching/doing /u/limeoats cavestory C++ tutorial. Even though I know some JavaScript and these concepts are somewhat the same, I feel like I gained more understanding of the concepts thanks to the visualizations (something I have not seen in other tutorials or learning programs). Excellent series due to thorough explanations and nice speed. Sometimes videos and sound are out of sync, but it does not affect the quality of the lessons.  Thank you, and I look forward to your other videos.   
I hope i'm not repeating what others have said, but i think this is an extremely generous offer you've made to let put this course up for FREE!!! As someone who's attempting to learn c++, i really appreciate you're doing this.  Thanks /r/engineer4free  
[deleted]  
Do it up! You'll be way ahead if you get through them all over the break.  
Wow. Imma save this, thanks!  
You are da man.  
Awesome.  Watched a few and you are better at explaining things than most other video tutorials I have watched.  
Hey thanks! Glad to hear the tutorials are working!  
Thanks man, you're really helping me out   
Wow! Thanks for this. Bookmarked!  
Thank you  
This looks great! I've been meaning to start learning C++, so this is awesome!  
Shall check this out when u get off work today.  Good stuff dude.  
I'm just starting with the first video this morning. Thank you so much. You have my respect.   
Awesome, hope you can make it through them all!  
Is free equivalent to ads?  
Thank you so much. I have to take C++ next semester and now I can get a jump on the syntax. Plus it has been awhile since I've learned the concepts. I really need a refresher. Thumbs up!  
Tagging this for later  
Looks good. Definitely will try it out!  
Can I ask why I would want to learn C++ over C# or otherwise? I've been programming in C# for over a year and haven't felt any limitations yet! So I figured it would be good to ask!  
As someone who started by learning a decent amount of C and now wants to learn C++ where should I start so I avoid repeating a lot of stuff?  
The beginning. C++ has stuff that might be similar to C but re done in a safer way. For example, you have std::cout to replace printf and std::ifstream("file.txt) to replace FILE* myfile("file.txt", "r");  
Although there are 47 tutorials, I think the cumulative time of the whole course is under 5 hours, if you have nothing else to do then you could watch it all I suppose!

Thank you!  
First off I can't thank OP enough for putting time and effort into sharing their knowledge. If I could ask you all a question. First, a little background: I'm a geography major with an emphasis in geographic information systems, and the primary programming language we use is Python.  I just took an introductory programming course covering Python and modules like Matplotlib/Numpy.  I've got to admit I still feel completely lost and am looking to school myself in the basics of programming.  I'm 30 years old of slightly above average intelligence, but I don't entertain realistic hopes of becoming a programming master. So my question is: if I want to beef up my programming skills, should I redouble my efforts exclusively on Python, or might learning and drilling in C++ give me a more solid framework for tackling Python anew? Or should I be tackling both?  
If  you are using Python I would focus on improving that skill. That being said C/C++ is considered the jack of all trades language. In my experience programmers going from Python ---> C++ is a lot harder than C++ --- > Python  
Thanks for the shout out! I never learned Python so I can't comment on that. While there are 47 tutorials, I think the cumulative time of the course is under 5 hours. If you have time you could consider learning C++ basics too.  
Awesome, thank you!  
Where does one go after finishing these?  
Awesome  
Thank you for this, I could use a technical C++ refresher  
I just finished my first semester of programming and the first full language I decided to tackle was C++. It's a very intricate language, any tutorial that can make the language simpler is a+ for me. I'll look into these over my winter break, thank you OP.  
Thanks for the shout out! If you've already taken an entry level C++ course then you've probably have seen all this already, but certainly check them out! More examples and explanations never hurt.  
ben?  
How difficult is the math aspect  
The math encountered in the tutorials is very basic, mostly just simple addition and multiplication. If you watch the tutorials, you'll learn much more about logic in if/else statements and loops. Combining those with simple arithmetic can create really powerful tools (like the investment calculator in video #21).  
arent you supposted to use using instead of typedef?  
Thank you so much. You're the best.  
The tutorials were very organised. They were simply enough to be understand by a newbie like me. Keep up the great job!  
[deleted]  
Was looking to get a headstart for next semesters programming courses. This will help tremendously!  
Do people still use C++ ? Isn't Java a better version of it ?   
Cool site.  What did you build it with?  
Just going through these vids. I'm already solid at coding in Java and started with C++ recently. One question/remark about video 32 (structure function example): Why do you make the readInput function return anything when you pass by reference anyway?  
/u/engineer4free any chance on java tuts?   
No subtitles? Es no bueno.  
It's weird how I said today is the day I will get off my ass and learn this stuff, then I come here first and find a post like this made yesterday. Must be a sign or something.  
Thanks man! Keep up the efforts!   
Thanks!   
Commenting for future use. Thanks!  
Nice job! Wish I had this resource when I was in my c++ class.  
This comes just in time. I'm taking a discrete structures course next semester after a year long hiatus from C++. I've got a couple weeks to review now.  
Perfect timing! I think the cumulative time of all 47 tutorials is under 5 hours, so if you skim through it won't take very long.  
Cool, thanks!  
I'm taking a data structures in c++ class right now and the first two weeks are a crash course in c++ fundamentals. Do you think these would be a good supplement to my class?   
I am so glad you did this. I had trouble finding C++ tutorials on YouTube that had what I want. Great Job.Cheers.  
Thanks for the shout out!  
This is a great refresher, I didn't use C++ this semester so was nice to refresh on some quirks of the language. Thanks  
I'm fairly new to C++ so i am  very excited to check out your videos. Thank you.   
Even though I probably don't want to learn C++ (I've got other programming languages to learn right now), thanks for this series of tutorials /u/engineer4free!  
On a mac, so 90% of your potential viewers are going to go find something else.   Not a word about where you are typing this stuff, only people who already know programming, therefore unlikely to even look at it, will have any idea what you are doing.   "Okay, so we're gonna go ahead and compile and run this." -mouse pointer disappears offscreen and suddenly output is displayed. So you ramble on for an eternity about what a string is but compile and run are assumed knowledge.  Who are you imagining is going to take this course?   just sayin.  
Appreciate your work  
I will definitely go over this.  
Hello, do you have one of those great videos about linked lists?  
RemindMe! 4 days  
Thank you so much.  
I always looking for lecture which  follows c++11 coding style   
Thanks allot sir  
Can you upload those videos so others can download them for offline use? Like a torrent or something would be great, thanks.  
This is very valuable! Good work!  
How do I save the files so they do something? Notepad + has a huge dropdown under "Save As" lol.  
I started learning python 2 months ago and I‚Äôm addicted to your site man. I‚Äôm almost 200 XP and its the main practice ground for me. Thank you! If I can help anyhow let me know.   
Just keep using the site as you are! It's designed to get better and better as more people use it. Resources get submitted and voted on, the difficulties become more accurate as users rate challenges, interesting solutions are upvoted, etc.  
 It's designed to get better and better as more people use it.  Did you implement some machine learning elements into the site to accomplish this? Genuinely curious.  
Probably just more people voting, which gives a better result overall in regards to quality. Same way as votes on Reddit I assume   
You mean when reddit works as intended and not when low quality content is reposted and updooted to the front page, right?  
You should move from legacy python to python 3, legacy python is end of life soon   
He didn't say he's learning python 2. He said he started 2 months ago  
facepalm yeah that makes sense   
Reddit is now digg 2.0. You don't deserve good users. Bye.  What is this?  
Hey op could you look into golang in the future? Would be awesome, thanks for this!  
I will add GO next, promise! :)  
You rock! There's a serious shortage of good material out there for beginners and I need to learn it for a potential job  
I thought their own tutorial was pretty good, though perhaps you wanna go deeper?  
Elixir?   
Might want to post this on the root thread, or OP may not see (op seems to replying to most direct response comments)

I love you too.

ALL OF THE HOMO  
An indeterminate amount of homo as it is not relevant to the discussion.  
Pro homo  
Pro bono?  
Love the layout but I wish I could see the instruction and the code window at the same time like codewars and other similar sites.  
This. It's impossible for me to keep the instructions in mind and I have to keep switching back to them and disrupting my flow. Otherwise, I think this is a pretty awesome tool.  
The current layout can actually be a good thing, IMO. It forces you to be more mentally engaged and build mental models of the challenges you're doing. One thing I would also suggest is getting a pen and paper and writing down a plan of action for yourself before switching to the coding interface.   
You know that's actually a good point.  I think I'm going to start trying to do that with all my lessons / challenges.  
Pseudocode  
Yes exactly. Also, having the code editor under the instructions... it just doesn't work in my opinion. It creates a very "clunky" user experience and is counter to how coding in the real world works.  
Definitely. I hope you keep it this way. There's no shortage of coding websites that use the format of "instructions next to code" which really detracts from the actual learning aspect. This space of similar websites is nearing saturation, and users who get tired of that format will certainly find your site.   
It should be this way. Teaches you to remember rather than have your hand held.  It‚Äôs like when I drive using a GPS. I kinda just zone out and do what I‚Äôm told. I learn my way around areas by looking at the Overview of directions and memorizing the which roads to turn down. I‚Äôll remember how to get there next time without a GPS(most of the time).  
I open up my ide side by side with practice stuff online.  My settings, my fonts, I'm not fighting the interface....then I just upload it or c/p it.   Might work for you?  
This is awesome! Maybe add a 'Reset Code' next to the 'Check' button in the Code tab? Otherwise, this looks great!  
Good idea! I'll add it to the challenge dropdown menu.  
I second this. When I finished one and all tests passed, the 'Check' button changed to 'Submit Final'. I went back and modified some of the code to optimize it (typical practice for me is to tighten it up later) but I couldn't run the check again. I had to copy the code, refresh the page, and paste it back in.  Otherwise, I really like this! I have been meaning to do a little coding challenge every morning when I first get in the office, and this is great.  
When you ‚Äúsubmit final‚Äù it‚Äôs just doing another ‚Äúcheck‚Äù and if it passes you get XP. If you mess your solution up and submit final, it won‚Äôt actually submit the solution. Not until it passes. So I wouldn‚Äôt bother refreshing the page.  
I believe he's not trying to get it to submit, though. E.g. make one improvement, make sure it works before making the next improvement.  
Perfect. That's actually the first place I checked.  
u/whoareyouagain: I originally thought by "reset" you meant reset the code editor to it's original state (the empty starter function). I think maybe you thought if you broke the code while cleaning it up and hit SUBMIT FINAL, it would insert the broken code into the database?  
I meant resetting it to its original starting point. Something similar to what Codecademy offers. When you fiddle around with the code wind up changing too much and just want to go back and start from the beginning. Essentially just reverting the changes we made to the code.  
Ok, so what I originally assumed. Perfect. I added the reset button to the dev build and it will go live this week. Thanks for the awesome feedback man!  
Awesome! Thank you!  
I start software engineering at university as an older student (26) in September. Can't wait to get stuck into your website! Thank you :)   
Good luck! I am sure you will do great üí™

This is an issue with Semantic-UI. I will submit an issue on GitHub.  
Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image https://i.imgur.com/qgRrMt1.png Source | Why? | Creator | ignoreme | deletthis   
Would it be possible to add R? Awesome stuff man!  
Seconding the request for R - that would be amazing!   
did you use a framework for the webpage or just your own CSS?  
semantic-ui-react  
Hard to even scan the ui site on mobile lol  
Thanks for all the work  
Suggestion - if you run your code and it errors, the error should be displayed somewhere.  
It does that for runtime errors, but not when the tests fail. I can see the test cases in the other window, but would definitely like to see what my code returns. Right now, I'm looking at the code and visualizing what it's doing, but without a debugger, I like to use Console.WriteLine() to see what it's actually doing.  
[deleted]  
Learn basic syntax first and then come back to do some challenges.  
Everyone has to start somewhere. If you are finding this too complex or want to do mobile I would suggest the app SoloLearn.  
[deleted]  
When I would travel during my java courses, I ended up saving a word file of around 100 challenges, and the page each challenge was on would tell me how difficult it would be from 1 - 10.  Yeah it‚Äôs not the same, but it should work it there‚Äôs no offline version of the webpage.   
Hey, it actually looks good. I will check it out.  
I use it and it's awesome! Thank you, and congrats for the tool!  
Bookmarked, thank you for sharing! Any chance of a mobile app in the future?  
I'm pretty strapped for time right now but... maybe at some point? Coding without a physical keyboard has always been a dealbreaker for me so it's not something I've even thought about previously.  
Just make the site mobile-friendly. Lots of people do these kinds of tutorials when they are away from their PC - on the subway, waiting for appointments, etc. There aren‚Äôt many online services of any kind that don‚Äôt get a majority of their users from mobile. You mentioned Duolingo... my guess is that 99% if their users are on mobile.   
That makes perfect sense of course. I often find myself stuck on a bus for hours per week without a computer, and I've taken to collecting any mobile coding tutorials and apps I can get my hands on, like SoloLearn, so I can practice while on the go. It also helps that I have a physical keyboard dock for my mobile device.  
Hey, this looks pretty cool!  Is there any way to change the language of the UI that seems to be automatically set to the language of the country I'm from? Kind of confusing mix with the English of the challenges, haha.  
Hmm yeah I can see that being mildly annoying for sure. The only way for now is to sign in (so you would need to create an account) and set your spoken language to English. When signed in, click on your avatar --> Settings --> General --> set spoken language to English.  
Oh, great, that worked!  Thank you for creating this wonderful website. I'll be sure to check it out thoroughly!  
Oh, also there is a button in the very bottom right corner.  
Thank you my dude  
Wow... looks like I have a busy evening ahead of me :)  
Definitely saving this to use in my classes next year. EDIT:  One thought...once I succeed it'd be awesome to see other people's answers or the "most efficient" one.  I can come up with an answer to some of these but wonder if I'm missing something obvious. EDIT 2:  Well now I see the solutions tab.....I was just expecting to see them when I submitted.  To get the other solutions I had to go back and find the same challenge.  
Awesome! i love the interactive way of learning!  
I've needed this for too long. Coding is like learning a whole different  language sometimes  and using Duolingos format is just what I need   
Probably the reddit hug of death but this site looks awesome aside from super slow loading time. This reminds me a lot of codewars with a friendlier get started process.  
This is awesome. Thank you for this.  
I'm glad you reposted this. I've been looking into how to start learning Python so perfect timing.   
Whaa, no GitHub authentication? Really, though, this is awesome.  
I'm adding it to the roadmap, promise!  
You're doing incredibly on your roadmap, in any case.  Great job.  
Does this use Semantic UI? I love the design and idea! Thanks for sharing!  
Yup, and I can't recommend Semantic-UI enough. Im using the React version by the way.  
I use the vanilla version at my work, I love it so much!   
[deleted]  
I will add this to the roadmap.  
Props to you brother, I'll take a look at it  
This is amazing! You‚Äôre awesome!   
memystic: all alone?  
What do you mean? EDIT: Yes I created the site on my own. I wanted a side project to learn React and got kind of carried away with it haha  
quite a project, bravo. thanks :)  
Feels kind of slow on loading content.  
There are about 350 concurrent users on the site right now. It‚Äôs usually quite fast during normal operations though.  
Hi, /u/memystic Is there anywhere that you particularly prefer we send feedback? Responses to here, or a specific page on Edabit?  
Here is good, through PM or the contact page.  
"Process was terminated. It took longer than 12000ms to complete" Getting this error for some programs even though the check worked. Edit: worked on the fourth try, without editing the code.  
Infinite loop?  
Nah, just timed out I guess.  
Hey, nice Spanish translation! Actually pretty accurate.  
The python link is broken for me? :/  
Fixed!  
You're awesome, thanks!  
How do you deal with security on a site like this? How does the backend work? Is there a worry of the user being able to execute malicious code? Do you have a design doc?  
Do the links at the bottom of the page work? This is what I'm talking about.  
They‚Äôre supposed to work yes. What browser are you using?  
Google Chrome on my PC. I'll check with my mobile browsers (Safari, Brave). Edit: The links work on Safari for iOS. But not on Brave (for iOS too). Maybe the underlying language (or something) is incompatible with these browsers..  
well done!!!  
This is super cool man!  
Awesome! Just one thing: I was doing the Silence Trump one and when I checked out the solution it gave me the solution for getAbsSum which was a different problem.   
That... it very odd. I'll see if I can reproduce the bug.  
Yeah just thought I'd let you know. I wanted to know the answer. I was gonna take a screenshot but I'm not sure how to post a pic in the comments and didn't feel like linking to imgur!  
Also, I wish there were a way to go back to the previous question! Sometimes I click continue when I mean to click on view solutions.  
Thank you so much for this site. A coworker turned me on to it. I needed to brush up on c# for multiple reasons, but primarily that the place I work at uses an uncommon language predominantly. This has helped me try to expand my knowledge in 20 minute blocks. Especially the fact that I can view others solutions after I solve the problem. You are amazing and are doing something that I know many others will benefit from. Keep up the good work and know that you are helping countless others üòÅ  
I can't wait to look into this in the morning!   
You are god <3  
dude, change the footer's z-index to 10+ or something, click events arent going through :D Edit: forgot to tell you, love the website! great job!   
Thanks for the feedback! What browser are you using? I've tried on Opera, Chrome, Safari and Firefox without any footer issues. Everything is clickable on my end.  
I'm on Chrome for Ubuntu, latest, stable.. Try it on the homepage - https://edabit.com/ i wanted to leave a message via email and clicked Contact... check that out just to be sure....  
Bug has been fixed in dev version. Thank you for reporting it!  :)  
Hey - LOVE THIS! One thing - After completing a challenge, if you look at solutions - do you still lose the xp? (I like the xp too much) - It would be cool if when you complete it - the solutions automatically shows so you can see if it was done another way? - just my 2 cents THINK ITS AWESOME + sharing around work  
The only time you forfeit XP is when you click "Unlock Solutions". Once you've successfully solved the challenge and click SUBMIT FINAL you get XP + you can view the solutions.  
I have favorited your website and will begin using it for JavaScript here soon. Thank you so much for all of your effort with this!  
I love duolingo and I'm struggling in computer science. I'll try it our!

Good on you.   
very similar to codewars style stuff. will give it a try!  
Looks good!  What‚Äôs the recipe?  I‚Äôve been trying to make the macaroni in the oven, cooked at ~350 degrees.  And what‚Äôs the sauce you used?  
Cool  
Thank you for your work!   
I really want to learn using Python. I've tried multiple websites, guides, tutorials, I always got so lost and stopped having fun after a few days. Hopefully this time it'll be different!  
My advice to you would be to learn the basics (force yourself) and then find a something you're genuinely interested in building and go build it. You won't know how to build it when you start but you'll figure it out along the way. You absolutely must build stuff, and be interested in the stuff you build.

Thank you for this, it'll help a lot!  
Will you add support for lua in the future?  
I think there's a small error in the description for the C++ question "Alphabet Soup". It states, "You can assume numbers and punctuation symbols won't be included in test cases. You'll only have to deal with single word alphanumeric characters." I think you meant to say "alphabetic" here, since "alphanumeric" includes numbers. This is a neat concept. Even though I use C++ daily for a living, it's making me think about the basics that I typically just copy/paste or google each time. =P  
Do you accept language requests?   
Thank you, I really needed something like this. RemindMe! 2 months  
I'd like to get more into it. Ran into quite a few errors in python with : within the first 4 problems I tried. Ran it in an actual python interpreter and it worked but didn't work on the site. Otherwise looks like a cool resource.  
can we get a dark theme?  
Sounds awesome, I'll try it soon. Also, have you heard of Exercism also on github? It could be a good place to fetch some exercise.  
remindme! 10 hrs  
Ive been part of a team at a University working on making a site for students to do exercises and submit their projects. It has been a success but we are looking to expand. Currently, it uses Skulpt to convert Python into JavaScript to run the code which means its all client side with limitations. We want to switch to server side with an actual interpreter but I have very limited knowledge in how to do that. Do you have a GitHub I can check out for tips and ideas, or if you could give me some pointers I would be very thankful.   
It would pretty neat if you can put the video where the protip bar is at   
Would this ever be a phone app?  
I'm working on a native mobile app but development has just started on it.  
Is it for mobile too?  
Interesting. What backend technology do you use for your site?  
Is this noob friendly? As in, somebody who is completely foreign to the world of coding?  
I'm not a beginner but your site do look awesome. I would have used this if I had seen this when I was learning to code.   
I always used code academy but you have the languages that they don't have (C# and C++ which I had to learn other ways). Definitely going to take a try at this.  
It looks very similar to Codewars from my quick glance - the biggest difference is that Codewars has a simple "Are you worthy?" test upon signign up.  
Reminds me of code school, watch out you might be bought out by another company like Pluralsight and end up killing the website because they think videos is the future not interactive ones.  
Oh man I love duolingo, gonna have a great time with this. Got stagnant with Freecodecamp learning to do Javascript, I'm gonna give this a try. Many thanks!  
I like it a lot!  I've been at my company for many years and am trying to move from QA into Development.  I failed my first interview many months ago however the company has many entry level developer positions opening up and so I am trying to gear up for another attempt.  This will definitely be one of the tools I use.   One thing I would like is to have the Check button and the Submit Final button be separate so I can continue to make changes to code once I've checked it once to try and make it better before I submit it as my Final Answer.  
You can already do that. The submit final button does the exact same thing the Check button does. If you break your code while cleaning it up and hit submit final, it won‚Äôt get inserted into the database and will revert back to the green Check button.  
I didn't realize that thanks for the heads up. From a usability perspective I still think it makes sense to have the buttons be separate because it doesn't seem immediately obvious to the user (wasn't for me at least).  
Yeah I agree, and you‚Äôre not the only one who has been confused by it. If I changed the text to ‚ÄúCHECK & SUBMIT FINAL‚Äù do you think that would still trip you up?  
Would the solution still be submitted if the code is changed, but still valid?  I suppose the use case I'm thinking of is "I want to change my valid code to something that may still be valid but I don't necessarily want it to be my final submission" I could see a couple scenarios on how to handle this:   ¬† Scenario 1: 1.  The check button is available 2.  The user submits a valid solution and the Check Button changes to the Check and Submit Button 3.  The User makes a change and the button changes back to the Check button again 4.  If the change is a valid solution the Check Button changes back to the Check and Submit (or just Submit Final) Button 5.  If the change is invalid then the button remains as the Check Button   Basically any time the user makes a change, change the button back to the Check button to verify that the code is valid and then once it is allow them to submit it if they want.  However if they want to continue making changes all they need to do is keep making changes and they will be able to check their answer without submission until they verify that is what they want to do. ¬† Scenario 2: 1. The two buttons are separate one for checking what you have written and one for submitting your answer to be saved 2.  The save button can either be hidden or shown and disabled until a valid answer is checked 3.  If the user makes a change to their code, disable the Submit Final button until the code is checked and verified that it is valid 4.  Once the code is valid re-enable the Submit Final button   Similar to the above only both buttons are present which lets the user clearly know they have two options: 1. Check what I have written 2. Submit what I have written Regardless, not trying to be overbearing or anything, just wanted to offer some suggestions.  
I hope this doesn't get buried.  I keep getting "IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level" on even the simple odd even challenge. And somehow my solution that works in Python IDLE doesn't work   
I'm looking to start but I have never learned anything. Like nothing. Do I need to learn a bit about let's say Java before I start doing these challenges?  
You need to know the basic syntax but that should not take you very long. After you got the basics, do some challenges.   
I don't even know what syntax means, lol.  
[Python] I really enjoy the site. I've had trouble defining so this has really helped me out! Great site!  
Hi! I've quite enjoyed this so far, but one thing I've noticed is that I've already encountered a couple challenges with broken test cases, at least for C#. It's a bit frustrating when I come across one. Great site otherwise though!  
Will there be an App on Android like Duolingo in the future? Just curious!  
As someone who has been self-teaching myself Javascript over the past couple months, this website has been awesome for me to test/apply what I have been learning. Thank you so much for this free tool.  
Is it supported on android mobile?  
It‚Äôs great! Can I get an iPhone-friendly version? Spend lots of time on mobile.  
This looks awesome! I do wish there was more accessible challenges to those just learning a language   
This awesome. Thanks for that!  
I was looking for that!!! Thanks OP!  
I wanted to use this for learning the basics of c++ (currently a java/python programmer) but it immediately launched me into vectors, I assume that was because I said "return true" was "very easy". There was no resources for learning vectors. I could go and learn vectors myself but then that seems to defeat the purpose. I don't see this as any good for learning and perhaps learning from scratch isn't the original vision.  
Great idea! Would love to see something like this on [Orbis Academy](www.orbis.academy) which aims to teach anyone, anything, for free, Internationally.   
What kind of programming are you trying to get into?  
For now, web-Development, especially backend and I would also like to make Android Apps one day. In the very long-term, I would love to get into /AI/Machine Learning  
give databases and the SQL language a shot, also. It seems like it wouldn't be creative but it's very fun  
I currently got sidelined into a database migration at work. Normally I do regularly software development.  I hate it. Massive queries with 400 lines and 10+ joins. Its a nightmare! From now on I will be the guy that does backend fixes. I do not recommend!  
 Massive queries with 400 lines and 10+ joins  Stop! My penis can only get so erect! One man's trash is another man's treasure, lol. Hire me and I'll do it instead. :)  
Maintaining other people's code under pressure isn't fun, that's true. Luckily, even in database work, if the company is big enough you can do db dev, not maintenance I'm glad there are different types of people who love different kinds of work, bc I love database work.  
If it were any other language, that‚Äôd be considered way too complicated and in dire need of refactoring. Would that not also be the best thing to do in SQL? I don‚Äôt feel like people talk about or attempt to measure the quality of SQL code ever...  
Yeah database shit always just feels tedious  
i can feel the heat.  
The last thing I think about when I hear SQL query is fun...  
 Massive queries with 400 lines and 10+ joins. Its a nightmare!  Sounds very inefficient. At that rate I would make new tables and migrate the joined data.  
I once wrote a 3000-line SQL procedure to rearrange our tables into a simpler schema for data migration; it took most of a year (it wasn't my whole job) and it was a perfect crystalline palace of logic, but I never want to write anything like that again.  
Yeah if you need 10+ joins to access data, your design is not good enough.  
A SQL query with 400 lines?? What the hell is it querying?  
AI and machine learning is more statistics than programming. I suggest you pick some introductory stats textbooks to read beforehand.  
Exactly, people don‚Äôt realise but AI/machine learning is very math heavy and not what they‚Äôre thinking exactly but nonetheless it‚Äôs pretty fun and if you have an interest in it then definitely have a go at it.  
Its more statistics heavy...processing massive amounts of data. Feeding AI data like a homeless man smokes crack.  
Mind recommending some? I had statistics at college but forgot most of it.  
Do you think it's possible to get in this field with no college degree? I am a 25 years old without a computer science degree(even worse, I have liberal arts degree), but I already work as a web developer. I was trying to study some calculus and statistics so that maybe in the future I'll be able to get into data science.  
Oh ok nice, I‚Äôm into front end, mainly because it was super easy to learn on my own. If you have the time I‚Äôd suggest learning it. It takes less than a month and is really fun. I don‚Äôt know back end so my webpages or mostly art since I have no one to do backend so I can actually host them. Your lucky you obtained such a skill. Disclaimer: YOU WILL NOT BE STEVE JOBS BY YOUR FIRST MONTH. IF YOU DEDICATE ENOUGH TIME AND ENERGY YOU WILL BE RELATIVELY COMFORTABLE BY THE END OF YOUR FIRST MONTH IF YOU GIVE THE PROPER TIME AND EFFORT!!  
Thank you. The skills I have are very basic. I have been advised that, in order to get the bigger picture, I should start with front-end and then move on. I'm glad to hear you said it isn't difficult. I will start looking into HTML to start with. How long have you been at it?  
If you're interested in programming I'd suggest doing cs50 course, it's free, from Harvard and the best introduction to programming you could get (in my opinion) I'm 30 and started last year üòÅ  
I made a very long comment on my tips to learning it about a month or so ago if you feel like searching for it but honestly bro, do a few HTML and CSS classes on code academy and then do a few follow along videos on YouTube and just follow along word for word on building a page from scratch. It literally takes maybe a week if you can just sit in front of your computer the whole time.  You‚Äôre not going to be making Amazon anytime soon but you can impress most regular people who can‚Äôt code. I have a project website that looks pretty chill and it‚Äôs roughly 12,000 lines of code now. If I actually knew someone who could do backend I‚Äôd have it atleast online by now. My login Authenticator isn‚Äôt working...( prob cause I tried to code it with JavaScript lmao)....  
I second the cs50 course.  I‚Äôm not sure where to specifically learn the backend stuff, but it‚Äôs be good to understand front end too. I‚Äôd also recommend Web Design for Everyone (on coursera, from the University of Michigan). Both will try to sell you a certificate, but you can audit them for free.  This is just to start, you‚Äôll need more in depth stuff later.  
HTML and CSS are really, really simple but for some reason they make my head hurt. I don't like trying to change the layout of things. Probably why my room is a mess all the time.  
"Less than a month"...yeah no.  Signed - developer.  
If front end took you longer than a month to understand it‚Äôs ok, but for most it didn‚Äôt take long to understand. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm not writing full fledge pages from top of my head but even rn it takes me maybe an afternoon to make a full single webpage and that‚Äôs all from YouTube videos and advice from this sub, stack overflow..  
Hello I fixed my main comment. I apologize if I offended you and I should have took into account those who might have taken a bit more time learning the languages than others.  
 It takes less than a month and is really fun  It's fun, but with a month experience you probably just know the basics of html and CSS and still struggle with Javascript. Forget building any kind of SPA or doing something more advanced.  Not trying to discourag anyone from learning front end developemt  
Yes I was a bit ambitious with my statement. You will have a comfortable grasp of front end in a month of dedicated learning. I am always to excited to encourage people to start learning I can exaggerate my progress and I will pay more attention in the future before I suggest someone learn.  
What did you use to get started? Did you start by focusing on any particular framework? I work in IT support but would like to focus more on picking up coding skills since I‚Äôm really only decent with powershell.  
I‚Äôm self taught. I started with code academy. I did the html, css, and JavaScript course repeatedly till I could do them without using any hints. Then I watched youtubers create webpages and I copied word for word. After a few days of that I started creating my own based off of the code from the videos. From their every time I hit a road block I search on stack or on Reddit for answers. By the end of my first month I was comfortable make dynamic webpages from scratch even without looking at old code.  I do want to emphasize I did nothing but code for about a month and a half. I didn‚Äôt have work and school was very basic and online at the time.  You will not be an expert in your first month or your first year. But if front end is what you want to do it is entirely possible to self teach yourself as it isn‚Äôt as mathematically intensive as other languages.  I would ask some of the others for better advise. As I‚Äôm still a novice myself.  
You and I have the same plan in programming bro. Home support üî•üî•  
This is a great idea.  Front end is a great way to learn hard concepts because it is so visual.  Just remember two things: If you like it there's nothing wrong with sticking to just that and please give it at least 3-6 months of your effort before you decide you do or don't like it  I thought "webdev" sucked until I realized it just sucks to learn JavaScript (or any language) at first no matter how fun you try to make it.  Once I started to see how it works with HTML/CSS and how frameworks help it becomes a lot cooler. :-)  
Dont wait to learn AI. You can start studying data science, for example, that has a los of AI and it is a much more demanded position in the industry.  Every day we have more developers and automation in webdev field.  Dont think "first i have to learn this, to learn that". It does nota aply here. Congrat for your new baby! Im from argentina and i know what It cost.  
Dude look up DataCamp it‚Äôs 100 bucks for a year and you couldn‚Äôt be make 80 or 90k in a couple months  
Python.  
Hey, it might be a little early to give this advice, but once you've learned a bit about html and javascript for making a basic website, it might be an idea to start learning React.  React is a front end framework that helps in building larger websites. A nice benefit is that when you know react, you can actually use the same skills to build mobile apps with react-native. I'm mainly a web-dev but it's been very handy when I need to make some small phone apps for personal projects  
A lot of companies expect you to not just code for Backend but also know how to design scalable architecture and even database design. Try to learn system design from resources like grokking the system design interview. Publisher subscriber architecture and message queues are popular these days. Also MVC architecture is popular for the Backend and REST API. NodeJS, Spring MVC are some of the popular web frameworks  
If by AI/machine learning you happen to mean working with natural language (not code) then Python is a must. I'm learning it now at age 42, and even if NLP doesn't work out for me, I could go into DevOps instead. (I used to be a network engineer)  
Good luck man! Let's get it! Learn by coding as much as you can.  
Thank you!  
I am really glad for you!  Inspirational story to you: one of my teammate in the past was from a small willage in Sri Lanka. Even today his home village still has no electricity. He is an iOS engineer, pretty good one. My first personal computer was ZX Spectrum, handmade by my father. My own first PC was 286, which motherboard and RAM was gifted to me by my classmate in the university. I used to buy a power supply and used pretty old black-and-green CRT monitor from soviet union coputer from the before-pc era.  
Refurbished pc's can be a fantastic deal, especially if they have a warranty just in case you get an unlucky pick.  
Fingers crossed! It wasn't easy saving and splurging like that on a PC  
It'll serve you well. All the best.  
OP, what country are you from?  
I'm in Ghana. A city called Kumasi.  
How‚Äôs the programming job market there?  
freecodecamp.org is the best; imo  
I feel like a kid at a candy store with all these new things to try out.  
Such a genuine comment/thing to say, seriously.  
Oh man I feel the same way time to time, learning new technology for web development  
From my experience, I did the same things at the beginning till which path is best to fits me. So, this is a journey and good luck out there  
Did you get it from Newegg? Does it have a discrete GPU?  
Agreed.

Thanks kind stranger.  
Just some unsolicited advice, Golang is a great a language to start on and teaches you a lot about something called concurrency.  Most languages need external libraries or a lot of boilerplate code to create this functionality but go has some great tools to use. You can actually cache this website if you are in an area that has internet issues, and it has everything you need pretty much.  There are github libraries that can be super helpful, but there are a lot of good tools in the standard library. https://gobyexample.com/ If you can swing this course for $15 then it has everything you need to learn how to become a web dev, no pressure but when the time expires it really will be $50 again and might not come down for a while; however, there is more than enough free stuff on line to learn from.  The reason why I say Go is because it doesn't need something like Node to run, or take up a lot of space like Django, it can run on old computers for smaller businesses.  It can also be used for IoT and raspberry pies are at an amazing price for what you get out of it. If you are wondering about front end, then React is honestly the best; however take your time and really learn how to use these languages.  When you interview for a job, don't let them tell you "we can't hire you because you don't know Nodejs", tell them why they should build microservices in Go!  Just kidding but a lot of international countries are using it because it can handle large loads of data where things like Java can crash...hard...and Node has to perform asynchronous processes and use more computing power than if you used a concurrent language. I don't mean to be a cheerleader for Golang but it has a lot of advantages that other languages don't, and you learn about pointers.  I studied math in college and to be honest, Machine Learning isn't that fun, it's a lot of thinking and experimenting, think scientist more than engineer.  However, you know what is fun?  Gettin  your greasy mitts all over that sweet, sweet data that start-ups have.  You could push your way into AI or Machine Learning, but at the end of the day, those systems need data.  Therefore, learn how to cache and munge data on the service side, and you can work on your own AI, ML projects.  Most of the time these are in academia, and we really aren't trying to be "those guys" but learning and building new projects in  ML and AI are really just boring and repetitive.  Now once you get the core built, then yea, it's awesome...but in order to get to the cool parts you really have to understand linear algebra, stats, and the logical background of AI.  With all of that being said, if you are interested then definitely learn Pytorch instead of TensorFlow because of some things you will find out about later.  Now, when it comes to Go, I believe it has a bright future to compete (or work alongside) Rust in Machine Learning for IoT devices.  C and C++ are king, but when it comes to networking and http, nobody can truly argue against the supremacy with Go.  The subreddit is really cool and the main reason I stuck with learning it was the Gopher is just too dang cute. https://blog.golang.org/gophergala Cheers and enjoy problem solving. ‚Äã Afterthoughts: Read up on Solidity and make sure you check out https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY0xL8V6NzzFcwzHCgB8orQ Listen, he sells his bootcamp in every single video and ramps up the pressure to buy, but you can learn more than enough for free on his YouTube channel.  I've seen the bootcamp and it really isn't worth the money, yes it is harder to learn blockchain programming on your own but it is much more worthwhile.  Take care.  
What‚Äôs the $15 course you reference ? You didn‚Äôt actually link it.

Goodluck man! I am from a third world country myself and I totally understand why it's a big deal for you. I had an old laptop of my cousin lying around that could barely even run 4 chrome tabs on it. But I still ended up being able to learn Vue.js and Firebase and code up a SPA small e-commerce website. With that money I bought my first ever dell laptop. It;s huge  
Congratulations! Refurbs are usually a good purchase so long as its from a reputable source  
Thank you!  
Continue doing it I achieved my goal and bought my first computer at age of 27 which was 2 years ago and I started programming I have got an engineering job in Germany now.  
Cool! Did you have any degree or career before getting the job?  
Yes, bachelor of social sciences and hard-working:)  
What programming language do you use? What field?  
Java for an embedded system in the logistic field  
Cool! Thank you for answering  
For web development, Try odin project website with free code camp tutorials, Play with CRUD operations and learn! https://www.theodinproject.com/  
In my humble opinion if you are willing to go into backend, you should learn a language the works both for web and for desktop apps such as Python. I feel that it gives you more flexibility and wages ar generally higher than with languages such as PHP  
Especially if you want to hop on AI/ML later, Python is your friend üôè  
[deleted]  
Yes. But certainly not impossible. There is a ton of learning material out there, and being comfortable with Python going into it gives you a significant advantage.  
Wish I could've sent you my old laptop before it completely died.  
Good luck, I find some of the free courses on udemy quite helpful (I'm a snr developer, I use freecodecamp / udemy / YouTube for a refresher) also stack overflow :) Try not take to much on, pick a technology and go with it.  
I buy refurbished computers only! I think you can have more power for much less price and also use computers that would otherwise be thrown away.  
This is amazing, congratulations on your new desktop. I hope the best for you while you are on your path of knowledge and understanding. I've spent a lot of time lately thinking about my children and how I need to make sure they realize how luxurious their "middle-class" life is here in the US. I've watched documentaries on life in other countries with them. And every opportunity I get I try to bring them down a notch and explain to them that my father grew up in extreme poverty, especially compared to today's standards of poverty, and we are always capable of losing what we have and returning to a life that we have never experienced.  
What did you end up getting?  
Dell Optiplex GX9020 I7. I got it from a company that refurbishes PCs from corporates.  
 GX9020   Very nice!  
Do you need any accessories to go with it?  
I have managed to get the usual mouse, keyboard and a monitor so I think I am covered.  
Congratulations! Good luck!  
Thank you so much!  
You have such a heads up on everyone else already.  It may not seem like it but you're going to appreciate your opportunity and be grateful for it.  The hunger will get you through the rough parts when the other people who didn't have to work for their opportunity will just give up. Glad to have you join the team, junior junior dev.  
Good luck, mate!

Hello, It was really inspiring to read all the comments here. Thank you everyone for sharing. I am from a third world country myself and I use this old laptop - Acer 5750z with Intel pentium B940 processor and 2gigs of Ram (It looks very new though).  I run Linux as it is the only way to run this machine at descent speed. I love this machine, it has kept my side through all tough times. I am not much of a programmer though but I do code in scientific projects. I completed bachelor's and since there is no demand for my field. I, like many others am opting to jump into programing to find a job to sustain. Looking forward to the day to own a new PC of my own and be able to do many more wonder with the knowledge I acquired so far. I fell you all out there. I wish everyone the best, Once again thank you for fueling my hope a bit more.  
What do you mean by third world country?  
Don‚Äôt feel bad my first one was at 19 when I got my first job and I‚Äôm in the US  
I'm happy for you really but Don't take me as a jerk but the real definition of a third world country is different.  ‚Äã What it really means are those countries which didn't aligned themselves with either US or USSR during cold-war era. It has nothing to do with being a poor economic country. Over years it's meaning is entirely changed which is wrong. ‚Äã Just some words of wisdom which this sub can take :)  
The term third world isn't widely agreed upon or standardized.  So it's meaning depends on context. For example, fourth and fifth world countries exist. Haiti is refered to as fourth due to its extreme poverty.  
‚Äã  context.   Taking the context in an incorrect manner is wrong itself & unless people stay mis-informed this problem will continue. During the Cold War, the United States, Canada, South Korea, Japan, and Western European nations and allies were categorized as First World countries. Second World countries included China, Cuba, the Soviet Union, and their allies. Third World countries typically had colonial pasts in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania.  ‚Äã Because many Third World countries were economically poor, and non-industrialized, it became a stereotype to refer to poor countries as "third world countries", yet the "Third World" term just includes all neutral countries some of which are economically prosperous like Finland and Switzerland. ‚Äã  For example, fourth and fifth world countries exist. Haiti is refered to as fourth due to its extreme poverty.  And this is why all these terms are removed in general English language and are replaced with terms such as developed countries, developing countries, least developed countries or the Global South.  
Fortunately, words and meanings change.    Take a gander at r/etymology if you haven't already; it'll shine a light on the losing battle you're fighting. Don't allow yourself to be pedantic about semantics. Instead of being prescriptivist, just accept that language changes.   Think of it this way: What version of 1st, 3rd world etc. is most useful in day-to-day speech?  
By some strange coincidence, I discovered that your interlocutor is correct only last week. Here is what Wikipedia says on the topic. In particular:  Due to the complex history of evolving meanings and contexts, there is no clear or agreed-upon definition of the Third World.[1] Some countries in the Communist Bloc, such as Cuba, were often regarded as "Third World". Because many Third World countries were economically poor, and non-industrialized, it became a stereotype to refer to poor countries as "third world countries", yet the "Third World" term is also often taken to include newly industrialized countries like Brazil, China and India now more commonly referred to as part of BRIC.  However, I wonder if you are right in a narrow sense - folks in First World countries are not going to change their understanding of it now. I expect I'll keep misusing it too!  
 Think of it this way: What version of 1st, 3rd world etc. is most useful in day-to-day speech?  It's not about the version since there was none to begin with. Repeating a lie again and again won't make it a truth. Just say it as a developed/developing/poverty-struck country which is the common term for this context.   By stereotyping a defined term of that time to just a common word which was nothing related to those countries not only you deny the truth but also the significance or the part which these countries played in that era. i.e. Stay neutral & peace-loving in any useless war.   Nevertheless, it isn't a political sub so I will stop replying any further comments but the op statement was for those who can see the reality and maybe just maybe stop using such useless terms in incorrect context. You can exercise your own freedom of expression and so can I.   Peace :)  
Sorry you are getting downvoted! I thought your contribution was interesting.  
Don't care about negative karma. Would be sad if I get banned though since I love this sub. If I am able to convince just a few of us, i'd be happy.  
I doubt you'd get banned over it. The moderation here is quite strict about what top-level posts can be made, and I generally applaud that, but comments on a thread are small-fry. The worst that'll happen is comments that are off-topic are removed, which is not a terrible outcome.  
Words and meanings change. Since the mid '90s and the end of the USSR the term 'third world country' has increasingly been used to describe economic stability instead of political alignment. The current vogue for using third world to describe poor economic climate is one that has arisen in the age of neoliberal globalisation and the parallel economic crises that exist alongside this era - also commonly referred to as the Fourth World War. In this context a third world country is one that has found itself (for example) at the behest of the World Bank and the economic restructuring which accompanied their appearance in every country they 'helped' always to the denigration and detriment of environmental concerns, workers' rights and educational problems. So yes it is possible to refer to third world countries in this way, it is a definition that has superceded the cold war one and is one that describes a very real socio-economic state for many.  
To be honest, if your just beginning raspberry pi is actually pretty great and does not cost much. 2 gb models can easily run Data structure and algorithm, you can build up html website, Listen music. Plus they got wifi. If your focus is not data science or gaming, raspberry pi is great to get started with.  
Wtf is a third world country? Are you in a different dimension or something?  
You don't know what a third world country is?  
I always thought a third world country was an underdeveloped country but I recently learned that it means that the country didnt pick a side in the cold war.  
I think it's the other way around, it used to mean countries that didn't pick a side during the cold war, after it lost that making and started to be used to represent developing countries  
 I think it's the other way around, it    used to mean countries that didn't pick a side during the cold war,  Exactly,   ‚Äã  after it lost that making   because cold-war ended.   ‚Äã  and started to be used to represent developing countries  Because most (not all) third world countries were developing countries. However this was wrong and hence those terms were scrapped off in use and replaced with the developed countries, developing countries, least developed countries or the Global South.  
You can politely say this thing. There is huge Mis-information on the internet so many people just don't know that they aren't correct. :)  
Nice‚úåÔ∏è  
Good luck! I started one year ago and It was one of the best decisions I‚Äôve made in my life. I started with Python, MySQL, PHP and also I learned the basic stuff of the AWS infrastructure. I‚Äôm more interested in backend however currently I‚Äôm learning swift and swiftui.  
Nice work bud, gotta feel good!  Good luck!

i'm a programming teacher at a bootcamp focusing on web development. if you need a tutor, i'm willing to help you out at no cost as i have some good friends from Ghana who have helped me in the past.  
Dude congratulations! I know how much these milestones can have an impact. Use this momentum and energy and crush it! I am so excited for you!  
Very happy for you! I'm from Ghana too and got my first computer from savings like you in my early 20s. I can relate. I went pro about a decade ago and now a Rails/WebRTC engineer. I will be happy to offer guidance if you'll need it.  
Good job and I hope this Desktop serves you well :)  
Don‚Äôt under archive my friend. I am 27 and from a third world country as well. Came to US and now have a masters in data science. Now working for a bank since 2 years. So you know buying a laptop was absolutely basic. I got a gaming one as I am into it. Acer Predator.  
i don‚Äôt know you but i feel so happy for you!! you deserve all the happiness  
Keep going and learning love from a moroccan guy who was lucky to live in Holland.  
Late but congrats man good luck on the journey I believe in you :)  
Nice  
I'm glad to see more stuff like this popping up. So much learning covers basics but then no one talks about real world applications. I'm decent with Python but have no idea how to use it to make a user friendly program. It's a daunting gap of knowledge.  
I think you need to look up project oriented tutorials and courses. Corey Schafer's channel bon YouTube has good project oriented tutorials for Django, Flask and Data Science. You can also try out Python related courses from University of Michigan where you learn to build simple projects from scratch(Coursera). Also let me not forget Sentdex's channel on YouTube. He is certainly the king of Python for learners. He has great tutorials for covering almost everything in Python though the one's related to AI, Deep learning and Machine learning are the best one's. Don't get stuck in tutorial hell for long.  
I haven't done in Python for quite some time but mentioning Sentdex gave me a warm, fuzzy feeling inside. Great suggestion.  
Sentdex is friggin awesome!  Leagues ahead of everyone on AI / ML.

Glad you liked it. There is no shortage of good content creators but it is difficult to find many in saturated YouTube content. And yes I do have a list of few good one's for C++ 1. The Cherno 2. javidx9 3. ChiliTomatoNoodle Unfortunately I don't have a good list for Java.  
Anything good for React Native?  
Oh my god, yes! This was so frustrating when I tried to learn Python a couple years ago... It's like there was this weird void between beginner tutorials that taught you syntax and advanced lessons that taught you like... I dunno, complex algorithms or something (they were well over my head, obviously) but absolutely NOTHING to bridge the gap between them.  
Im starting out from an application dev perspective but edx cs50x course helped bring many of these subjects to the spotlight for me like algos(searching, sorting, inserting), memory allocation, linked list, hash tables, introduction to algos effiency(big O notation and Im forgetting the other) etc. It uses C for the most projects and the lectures, including the follow up ones(Doug the TA is a great explainer) that go into more details on the subjects are highly recommended prior to starting the projects as you will get hints. Im on week 5 and were about to pivot towards python which I have more experience with due to work(simply api uses)  
I‚Äôm still working through html/ css and beginner at JavaScript. I have a ton of ideas I want to execute: -easybib clone  easy budgeter.  choose your own adventure (similar to Oregon Trail)  And I have ideas that are way above my knowledge base. I tried building an app through Apple‚Äôs app builder and got stuck at the graphic sizing part (loading assets and making them work). So I need to migrate to easier stuff and hone that.  It helps me to have an end goal. I‚Äôm building websites for clients, so I just rip ideas from other like sites. If a customer wants to show work, try a modal. If a customer wants to show a renovation, do an image overlay.  It‚Äôs really helped me to have a goal, rip ideas, and clone. The UI seems to just become reflex.  For me, two big issues: Firefox has a dictionary of stuff you can do. But W3 schools gives you models of what it will look like.  Instead of clicking for a modal, maybe a mouse over event...  
Hey, i'm mentoring a group of people of various level at the moment about frontend specifically. We are going trough basics/complex/real file cases so i'm online all day helping them while i work, guiding them without directly giving answers on how to do stuff, giving real world cases to solve, talking about the real market and how it operates, tracking their progress and setting up a learning path for their level. I can't really get you in the group, but i can help you out with general direction, answers questions you might have, giving you real life examples of the thing you want to implement, ideas of what you might use, or even just bounce ideas on who to do things.   If you like the idea hit me up by messages and we'll be in touch. Or anyone for that case, i can't mentor you but i can't help.   I'm doing it for free, so no gotcha or anything like that, just helping out the community.  
I appreciate that. This sub has always been chill. I don‚Äôt know what problems I‚Äôll have tomorrow. My biggest problem is blending JavaScript code.  I‚Äôll get this code and that code. They work on their own, but putting them together is a beast I‚Äôm working on.  I need to spend more time in the sandbox.  
Yep, javascript has a lot of ways of blending code, but working on projects, things that really makes you research and try stuff. Anyway, pm me if you want my discord, i'm online like 20h a day, whatever i can help with i'll be happy to do it. It's good to have someone to ask really fast questions or directions generally  
This is definitely very important, and it's something many self-taught programmers don't really come across or study, despite all University courses dedicating at least some time to HCI.  
Honestly, I needed this. Been learning/schooling for a while and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúyeah I can write a block of code, but like... can I make something now?‚Äù  
Yeah... At least where I go to school, it seems that internships are expected to bridge that gap. Blegh  
So much knowledge. Like am I gonna use a search algorithm in my app?  
 I'm decent with Python   Why would you rate yourself decent?  
[deleted]  
Honestly, that was the difference between my academic coding and the coding I do now for work. The academic stuff was complex and optimised but never left the IDE. Work code feels basic but by this metric it would be my first 'decent' code.  
Why did i get downvoted for this question? Did it come across as rude?  
[deleted]  
This is me. I know a lot of python and have done so many tutorials and exercises, yet never written a single application in my life. I just... Don't "get" it.  
that's essentially impossible.  
[deleted]  
I feel like you can't be an expert unless you've spent 10,000 hours debugging bugs that  you couldn't believe took you that long to find the causes lol  
Not really. One could be good enough with Python to solve 90 out of every 100 elite coding problems with ease since there are generally short little programs, but be totally incapable of creating an app. They are still decent at coding in Python. They are not expert or architect level, but decent.  
The vast majority of newbies, aka the audience of this subreddit, completely over-rate their skills. My favourite is the term intermediate. "Hi, so I've read a few python tutorials so now I guess I'm an intermediate python developer, but I don't know what to do next. Should I actually write a script, from scratch, without following a tutorial, for the first time?" It's a fantastic illustration of that initial peak on the Dunning Kruger graph.  
so many people do this and it's laughable. We're nowhere near decent in a language if you can't use it. For example, I can write some algorithms in Python and read python but since I can't make anything useful or can't hack with it, I'm basically shite at it. With JAvaScript I'm pretty good though  
 With JAvaScript I‚Äôm pretty good though  You got the caps lock delay? I can give you a fix if you‚Äôd like. Tested on linux only.  
no I'm just rubbish at typing javascript  
 You got the caps lock delay?  Do you seriously use caps lock to type capital letters?  
I mean, hate to say it, but that's literally what universities/colleges are for. I get that not everyone can afford that, especially in the states, but that's kind of a different problem. The resources are there.  
Depends though, a lot of unis have a very strong focus on theory of computing, and really don‚Äôt teach you much about programming itself. That‚Äôs the student‚Äôs job to learn. Although I suppose there are also a lot of schools that teach you practical applications in addition to the theory  
My post comes from being a student a semester away from graduating who still does not know these things.  
and your uni doesn't offer any courses on system design or ui/ux design or similar? I am in my second semester and already have a standard lecture just for system design.  
I'm supposed to take a "systems analysis" class to graduate but it isn't being offered and it's my last requirement, so it gets waived ü§∑ There was a GUI course but it got removed from curriculum.  
The resources are there? Not for everyone at all. I'm 32 working a full time job and have dependents. I've done the Uni and college thing back in my 20's. I want a career change and have to study around my other commitments and cant get into more debt that I'm already paying off  
Ok, so say you want to become a carpenter. Do you expect there to be free easy access resources to learn that? UI/UX design and system engineering are trades just the same. Having free resources to learn is amazing, but should not be the expectation, because someone out there has to put the work in to provide that. Usually that's what universities/schools/internships/apprenticeships are for.  
Honestly, thank you for taking the time to write/type this guide out and for sharing it with us all! I love that everything is broken down so nicely, telling us what to do and what to identify. Ill be looking forward to the part 2 of this! Although, I'm not really sure what it'll do or if it'll benefit you but I "clapped" for your article! I'd like to add that I dont really have any constructive criticisms to give you but I'd like to say that everything you've written is so to the point that it makes me feel better reading it.  I get tired when people write paragraphs upon paragraphs on a topic that could've been easily condensed into a few sentences that would have made it much easier to understand, though I understand that some topics needs to explained thoroughly so they're lengthy but oftentimes most of them do not need to be lengthy, just like this part of this comment, to further prove my point.  
 I get tired when people write paragraphs upon paragraphs on a topic that could've been easily condensed into a few sentences that would have made it much easier to understand  Hahaha üòÇ  Thank you this made me laugh!! You definitely could have ended it at the first comma üòâ. The post was actually almost  twice as long before I realized at that pace I would be writing a text book and started deleting most of what I had written (it was not easy!). On the other hand I've read a lot of tutorials and guides that leave you wanting more. You read it and you're like, 'that's it??'.  I tried to strike a balance by adding links to more resources in the 'Further Reading' section, so people can delve deeper into any of the topics.   Ill be looking forward to the part 2 of this!  Thanks! You're feedback makes me more excited to finish writing it!!  
I need this so much. I know 3 languages, and have no idea how to make anything other than fancy calculators. I've asked around on reddit, and forums, and all I got was vague and unhelpful tips like "Oh, calculators might be useful to someone"  
As a student that is juggling many projects this is a coherent guide, and easily understandable to share with my group. I LOVE this, and really broadened my understanding of how management of tasks could be achieved. Thank you !  
This looks really great.  Consider publishing it somewhere in addition to Medium. Medium is a cash grab and actually blocks your content from people in their attempt to charge users.  
Any suggestions?  I pasted the free 'friends' link, but it seems like it's still requiring some people to sign up.  
I‚Äôm not sure. Wasn‚Äôt trying to beat up on you. I know why people post on Medium. Their paywall can be maddening at times.  
 Wasn‚Äôt trying to beat up on you. I  Lol don't worry I def didn't take it that way.   Their paywall can be maddening at times.  I know!  I love Medium because they have interesting articles, but I would say most of the articles I read are short and don't provide the value that would require me to subscribe at this time. I have found a hack tho: I always open the link in incognito mode, an d it generally works. If I use up the free articles I use a different browser in incognito mode lol.  
its maddening until you go to remove cookies and do it specifically for  medium.com and signed out of your medium account and then refresh the page ;)  
Free Code Camp dumped Medium  
How do you work with the security aspect of webapps and mobile apps? Anyone building apps may or may not be aware of testing if there are security flaws. How does one deal with it and how do you deal with them?  
Good comment. Security of the app should be among the first considerations these days. This would include protecting the backend (assuming this is a web-based app) from the user, i.e. some kind of screening of all user input to avoid things like malicious code injection.  Some consideration of the ethics of harvesting user data for resale should also be included (a very common practice for web app developers, it seems) as database breaches are a major security issue.  
Thanks for this! I've been learning on and off Android app development for about 2 years now and I think I have a pretty good grasp of it (still much to learn though!) But what I've struggled with most is putting the basics together to form a coherent app and user experience. So I'm really looking forward to your further installments :)  
I've been struggling with this for quite some time. I would say I have some intermediate knowledge about my programming language of choice but I find it hard to plan projects... That's my biggest problem with courses and books about programming. Its sooooooooooo hard to find a course about programming that actually talks about how to plan projects and how to train your brain to think like a programmer(most of them just have a little chapter or a very little 10 minutes lecture on algorithms). I've been looking into content and talks about Computational Thinking/Algorithms lately and I found 3 books. If anyone is interested:  Think Like a Programmer: An Introduction to Creative Problem Solving - 2012 (this one got lots and lots of code with C++ samples; talks about a problem and asks you to develop an solution for it! very practical book). Computational Thinking: A beginner's guide to problem-solving and programming - 2017 (very theoretical and talks a lot about the process of planning/developing/arriving at a solution "that a computer can execute"; kinda hard to understand this book if English isn't your first language :P). Computational Thinking: First Algorithms, Then Code - 2018 (I haven't started this one yet but it looks like its a mix of the other 2 and a bit of commonly used algorithms).  I hope this information can help you in any way like its been helping me develop this meta skill :)  
 Computational Thinking: First Algorithms, Then Code - 2018 (I haven't started this one yet but it looks like its a mix of the other 2 and a bit of commonly used algorithms).  Thanks, these are great! I've been trying to get my little cousin whose starting programming to think like this so Ill recommend this!  
You‚Äôre a hero.  After two years in college I asked how to make an application but my professors didn‚Äôt know what I was talking about. I literally didn‚Äôt have the vocab to describe it  
I‚Äôm a UI/UX designer if you‚Äôre looking to hire one :)  
I‚Äôm glad you took the time to make this. I‚Äôm sure plenty of people will find it helpful. Looking forward to the following guides.  
Nice!  
arxxte?  
Pardon?  
 There arxxte several keys to building low cost/high-quality web, mobile and desktop applications.   
From me and on behalf of most new programmers thanj you  
This is one of those gaps in my knowledge for which I haven't seen many useful guides out there. Thank you for making this. Looking forward to reading this and future parts!  
Tactical dot  
Thank God is bi-weekly. It's just what I was looking for! Just the first part is already a time saver for me. I know some code, but no real world experience yet, so maybe I'm idealizing it but... The text  feels information dense and practical. It has cleared many unknowns for me!  
thank you for this, so many people will be able to benefit from the practical side of learning programming.  I can learn processes all day, but I need more realistic real-world applications to understand what I "should" be learning instead.  
This is excellent thank you.  
I think a lot of people, including myself, recognize this struggle. Great work man!  
This helps a ton, after going through free courses on the internet and Udemy, I've been building my own stuff for the first time and will probably be writing some posts to motivate beginners too!  
Quite detailed, quite helpful. It would be awesome if there was equally detailed guide on building a Language Learning App, especially a list of proven and most useful APIs. Would live to go through something like that!  
Thank you  
Thank you!! I have no idea how to make the jump from writing something that only runs in a Python IDE to something anyone can run.  
I believe a way to go would be to publish ur code on github, and share it via social media.  
You‚Äôre awesome for sharing. This will fill so many gaps in my understanding of what to do, thank you!  
I would love something like this for C++ projects and using build systems for large-scale projects. I came out of undergrad knowing some C++ and git, but modifying build systems and such is still a black-hole for me.  
My dude I fucking love you.  
Excellent article! In my experience, requirements gathering and focusing on valuable requirements that generate real business value for the product or client is the first step most devs get wrong. I suppose that's the value a great PM brings to the table, but if you're a 1-person team then learning the PM side of development is super valuable. You've captured it so well in this article. Great job. Looking forward to the next installment. edit - looking through your post history I see you asked for something like this a year ago. I love the story behind this. Cheers!  
Hahah OMG I totally forgot that post!! I remember there were a couple great suggestions, but they were focused more on walking you through building an app with a specific platform/language. I just went through the rest of my post history and it's actually pretty cool to see how I evolved over the years üòÖ  In my experience, requirements gathering and focusing on valuable requirements that generate real business value for the product or client is the first step most devs get wrong.   Indeed! It clicked for me when my last client was always asking for new stories to be added to the sprint. At first I'd throw it into the backlog but once I realized that some of the stuff we were pushing back had way more value, I had to begin taking a firm stance and explain why we should not include in the first Phase. Things went so much smoother once I learned and applied this principle.  
THANK YOU!! üôèüèæüôèüèæüôèüèæ  
Your welcome bro!! üëäüèæ  
Thanks bro, its an excellent read! Really appreciate this as a noob ;)  
Thanks bro!! Much appreciated :) hope you are not a noob for long ;)  
Thank you for this! Im kind of relearning everything after leaving it for 4 years to pursue other things, and it's crazy how many but also not a lot of actual tutorials there are out there, I appreciate you!  
Nice!  
This is awesome, thank you!!  
Fantastic, looking forward to the next entry!  
Step 2 and 3 should be reversed, get yourself a MVP first, then make it pretty  
Thanks! This is a great point, and actually something I've been trying to deal with this morning. We want to get the general layout figured out , so that updating the MVP won't require re-writing too much code, but we want to focus the initial efforts on functionality.  So now I'm thinking I might have to break down UI/UX into two parts, one before step 3, and another after step 3 going into more detail. Appreciate  the feedback!  
u could definitely have a ui that works before getting the backend functionality working to make testing easier and then make it pretty.  
IMO starting coding by building stuff is good but you should ABSOLUTELY NOT start with mobile apps. It's easy to create a web app that is useable but mobile is a whole different game because of the very limited space. It really takes some good experience and understanding of UI/UX to squash a simple address form into a mobile screen. Something you probably not have when you just start coding. Something you might not even be that much interested in because you'd rather write server code. That's the reason why some apps look like "real apps" and some look like shitty apps for cheap bluetooth sex toys. Not trying to shit on your work here, but I strongly oppose starting out coding with mobile apps. Of course, you can do anything if you commit hard enough, do what you can't, yada yada. Getting into coding (especially in these days) is already frustrating enough. No need to go the extra hard routes.  
Thanks for your review!! You have a good point. The guide is meant to be language and platform agnostic. This choice is left up to the reader on purpose (the future posts won't contain code etc.) I've updated my description to make this clearer, and will try to use examples from web and desktop apps to drive that point home in the future posts. Cheers!!  
Great work mate, this is very useful. Looking forward to part 2.  
I need this in my life!!!  
üòä  
Nice INVEST tip. Also really appreciate how you also show tips on rapod prototyping  
Thanks!!!  
One of my closest pals from school,  and easily one of the best programmers I know, hammers the concept of the importance of requirements frequently. And I agree. A few months ago I was working in an agile team and when I mentioned requirements, I might as well have been talking in another language.  I initially thought they were joking, they were not.  
Haha maybe they call it user stories? Your friend is probably an amazing programmer because of the focus on requirements!  Without clear requirements to keep you guided, Once your code goes over 10k lines of code, if you don't have requirements nicely defined then I hope you have the brain of rain man.  
You are my god.  
üòÑ Part II tomorrow!  
S4L  
big pp  
.  
Will be there a Part II?  
Yes, there will be 6 parts.  
Thank you soo much!  
This is super cool, I just finished my homework for "Introduction to Software Engineering" - I'll definitely use this as secondary reading.  
Ive had an app idea for 3 years but have zero experiance with coding or anything computery other than microsoft office. Would this be something worth building experience for? Or would it be better to team up with an experienced person? I figure itd be easy for someone to steal the idea though so maybe i should just learn it for myself?  
I wish I could find this but for creating videogames  
Ah yes video games is a different beast; If you find a nice video tutorial, please share with me! I'm curious to see the flow.  
I have never seen programming flow explained so well. I always get lost when planning complex tasks, but you wrote it in such details that it makes perfect sense and makes organization much easier.  
Thank you for the kinds words!!  
Can't read it no subscription  
Try opening the link in an incognito browser. I posted the friend link so it would be free but I guess there's a catch.  
It's not a loss for you?  
No, I did not join the partner program.  
I thought starred articles means paid articles, am i incorrect?  
This is great. I‚Äôm very interested. Working as a software engineering intern right now and by FAR the learning curve of knowing how to code ‚Äî> being able to understand, create or modify applications has been hard to get through. This kind of tutorial could absolutely help us.  
Thanks!! When I started a job in software the code base we were working on was massive. I think that's the environment formal higher education caters to.  
Can you explain more on what you mean by the second sentence?  
Codebase in software just means all the source code for the application. This was a bank, online banking, and there must have been like a million lines of code at least.  
[deleted]  
Thanks for this!  
ok now we're talking,I actually had an app idea and was about to ask this exact question,please tag me on the rest of the parts,thankyou for your work  
Thanks for the feedback!! I'm glad you may find it helpful! I plan to release these on Medium (the link in the description), so you can actually follow my on that site and you will get notifications when I release each part.  
This looks really great, thank you.  
Thanks!  
you dropped this üëë  
stoop  üò≠  
"Cloud services and APIs" lol I have no idea what to do hahaha. I kinda know what API is, but you just destroy my dreams now... This is far from a begginer guide IMO.  I know how to make simple things, but this is just too much. This is something for big apps.  Thank you for the hard work, but I have really bad time following other people working flows... I prefer my mess.  
Yes, Its kind of more geared to people who know how to code, or people who have a budget to hire a developer once they have their designs/plan. Good luck in your learning journey my friend I hope this becomes useful for you down the road!  
hell the fuck yea, thanks!  
This is awesome! Thanks  
Sorry off topic but can someone tell me why I always get errors when installing react, I have node installed....it‚Äôs on a MacBook Pro running Catalina  
I noticed that you didn't have anything mentioning accessibility in your article. Something like this is the perfect venue to bring attention to empathetic design when creating user stories and golden, paths through your app and extend an understanding of the different accessibility modalities users with disabilities use to interact with applications. Screen readers, switch controls, thinking about linear and logical meaningful sequences when designing user flow, it's all quite important and something most people miss or don't even think about until they get sued or lose out to valuable government contracts or federal funding since they aren't yet accessible.  
This is an excellent point. I need to read up on these topics a bit more myself, and I will certainly include them probably in Part II.  
Even at university level, my programming courses literally just scratched the surface and did not do much to push me into building projects. Certainly I would say it is a lot of self learning and self education that has pushed me to build projects. University just puts the tools in front of you and that is pretty much it :/  
[removed]  
Hi, Thanks for the feedback. I want to understand your question so I  can properly answer it.  Are you a coder or a non-coder?  What are you looking for? I don't teach how to code.It's for any level. If you're a beginner there's a further reading section at the end.  
Nice'  
Really loved your post. Any estimations on when the next parts go live?  
Thanks! I'm hoping by tomorrow or Saturday at the latest!  
hey, here's part II https://uxdesign.cc/beginners-advanced-guide-to-building-an-app-ii-your-first-prototype-6ba1f0644720?source=friends_link&sk=b24a9ea0a1a61d2c03989265533a1dfb  
Looking forward to reading this!  
Great!!  
Isn't this more about managing the creation of an application as opposed to actually making one?  
It's everything but the programming part.  Here's Part II https://uxdesign.cc/beginners-advanced-guide-to-building-an-app-ii-your-first-prototype-6ba1f0644720?source=friends_link&sk=b24a9ea0a1a61d2c03989265533a1dfb  
Commenting to read later! Thanks for doing this  
ditt0, thx!  
My pleasure!  
I need instructions on how to ACTUALLY make the app. Planning and designing is great bit it's useless if you can't make it a reality. Anyone have any good places to learn this?  
You are trying to learn how to code? Do you know which platform you want to code for?  
Info on what actual programs to download and use would be really amazing  
Check out the "Further Reading" section at the end for the tools I used for this part! Really though, the articles will be more geared to using the language and platforms that you are comfortable with.  
Thank you - This is great The thing is , I've taken a bunch of coding classes online and have a decent understanding, but when it comes to applying it - I am entirely lost. Like - if I want to write an app, what software do I write it in - how do I go from writing to compiling to going live and what are all the steps from a-z. I have experience with product mgmt, so user stories and userflows I can get my head around, but the logistics - the place where I apply my code , if you will - that's where I am entirely lost. Thank you - I look forward to the rest of your series!  
don't forget about this 1000+ pdf collection  
Amazing collection! For some reason, Github truncated it to just 1000, with 46 omitted  
You can use the Github API to get the full list without cloning the entire repo locally.  https://api.github.com/repos/tpn/pdfs/git/trees/master ref: https://developer.github.com/v3/git/trees/#get-a-tree And then maybe use the "Find file" feature on the Github html page to individually retrieve files you're interested in.  
I did not know about this. Now i will share it in my school group too, thank you man   
Now they have to one-up you with a 10,000 pdf collection.   
Then OP can one-up them by linking to Libgen.   
Thanks for that!   
Someone should help him get those sorted into categorical directories

I'm currently at the airport, so I can't look at this now - hense the dot, saving the post.   
Depending on the app, there should be a star, ellipses or something that allows you to save posts. You can also go to your profile and view posts you've upvoted or downvoted.

Sigh this is literally too much information for noobs.  "Where do I start" is probably the biggest problem for people.   
Agreed. One of the links in the other thread (the one with 1000 PDF's) was a style-guide from Lockheed's joint-fighter project. Completely useless to 99% of the people out there.

Decided to actually just google it and found it, it's for coding in C++ so would be useful to C++ developers but the programming practices are good for any Developer here it is I'm mostly excited because OMG LOCKHEED, my childlike fascination ignited :) http://www.stroustrup.com/JSF-AV-rules.pdf   
A lot of this seems to be better summarized in 'building maintainable software'  
Aerospace is cool, man. Did you follow your interests and end up working for Lockheed or elsewhere in the industry?  
I couldn't find a single pdf on object oriented design or design patterns in the 1000 pdf list...  
The source material of this books is the StackOverflow Documentation project that has been closed last year. Those guys have just turned it into a nice book format, but it's still a documentation. It's mostly useful as an offline reference.   
After running into multiple threads like this, ive decided to start with CS50 from Havard. I hear learning the logic is fundamental before learning a specific language.  
However you want to do it, do it.  Just do it though, you feel?  Pick something and go at it and you'll find that you're learning and progressing.  
Pretty nice though if youve learned a good bit of at least one language  
YouTube playlists  If your a noob Do you know what language you wanna do at least?  
I would say for noobs (at least for me originally) that's one of the biggest problems I ran into. My advice: IT DOESN'T MATTER. Just commit to a project a finish it. And then commit to more. Programming isn't about the different languages, it's about making something. So make it happen guys :)  
Looking through the Python and JS books they read as mostly reference   
Nice! By the way, I wrote a little bash script to download them automatically. Here it is: #!/bin/bash  wget -c --retry-connrefused --tries=0 --timeout=5 --convert-links --html-extension --mirror -r -l 0 http://book.goalkicker.com/ mkdir -pv ~/book.goalkicker.com/EXTRACTED_PDFS cp -v `find ~/book.goalkicker.com -name "*.pdf"` ~/book.goalkicker.com/EXTRACTED_PDFS  After it is done there should be a directory within the book.goalkicker.com directory, located in your home folder, called EXTRACTED_PDFS containing all of the pdf files from all of the sub directories.  
Or you can download them all via http://book.goalkicker.com/all.zip üòä  
That too üòÄ. I did not know about the URL. Thank you for the information.

Need some LaTeX for your latex?  
Thanks for sharing!  
Since this post was popular, I posted a list of a shit ton of programming PDFs

Yes same here but this is exactly what programming need its about information and knowledge and these things going up with sharing.   
Thank you sir, and thank your classmate for me as well!  
Thank you for sharing  
Honestly this is amazing thank you! That algorithms book is going to save my ass this semester.  
Ahahaha it is exactly same for me.   
Incredible. Thank you  
I just checked this out and this seems like gold. There are some subjects missing (Unity and ASP.Net come to mind, unless ASP.NET is somewhere in .NET or C#), but this seems really comprehensive, maybe even too comprehensive just for learning from them; I don't know how to approach these yet. P.S. On further inspection, this is way too detailed for learning something grounds up. More for a reference or for curious idling.  
these are really great thank you so much  
Wow, thanks so much, just skimming through there's a bunch of great stuff!  
Thanks for sharing. As a teacher I'm always looking for more resources.   
The teacher my school needed.   
great stuff!  
For people like me, that's a gold mine.  
So what‚Äôs the target audience for each book? A complete beginner to the language? A reference book to accompany other methods of learning as you progress? Or a refresher for someone who perhaps mastered it in the past?  
just checked the latex doc. It is starting from 0 and goes to the finished pdf. But it is more of codesnippet for that, codesnippet added for that. Nothing really large texts or code explanations. So Notes for Professionals does apply :)  
I used Java Android and Python but them as a second resource. I was starting from scratch with YouTube playlists.   
Awesome - thanks!   
Holy crap this is amazing. Thank you so much for this!

I just wanted to say that after having downloaded and gone through the books. There are some wonderful teaching resources.  I then shared it with  South East Asian Computer Science Teachers  Association (SEACSTA) and they were all very grateful for this resource.  Thanks once again for sharing and to the many authors who have contributed to this collection.

Not this garbage again...  It's just a bunch of stack overflow answers put together haphazardly with no head or tail.  
I am looking at the C++ book now. It looks like an incredibly in expansive book with a detailed table of contents and a the first page starts with a sample "Hello World". It explains those parts at a level a technically inclined beginner might be able to assemble. Is it possible they updated since you last looked? EDIT - wording.  
It's from the StackOverflow Documentation project. It's not just plain answers copied, they have been curated.

Is excel vba much different to excel?  
Start with formulas. Formulas are 'vba', just already packaged in  a function. Learning to use the autocomplete in formulas feeds into the autocompletion of vba editor. But, yes, excel vba is very different from excel. Filling spreadsheets and making formulas is different from programming. Once you master formulas, try making your own 'custom formula' that selects the active cell and, say performs a few opertions on it (take cell a5, mult 7, subtract 3.4523, and then round to two decimals). Then get it to work in your spreadsheet. Do all you that, and you Will know if you want to drop or pursue it further!

I like what you're doing.  I'd make some code structure tweaks. First, in all your classes you have an odd mix of class variables and instance variables.  When you do this: class SpeedTest(object):      download = ""     upload = ""     latency = ""     jitter = ""  You're defining class variables here. And then later accessing them as instance variables. If you're limiting things to only one instance it's still better to use instance variables here, by initializing them in an __init__(self): function. class SpeedTest(object):     def __init__(self):             self.download = ""         self.upload = ""         self.latency = ""         self.jitter = ""  Second, in your __main__, you 1) make a SpeedTest instance, 2) call its init_driver function to initialize a driver, then 3) call a method of your SpeedTest instance and inject that driver back in as a parameter. That's kind of wonky. What I'd do is have a separate class that would create and initialize a driver, then create a SpeedTest object with that driver as a parameter: if __name__=='__main__':     driver = DriverFactory.createFireFoxDriver(wait=5)     speedtest = SpeedTest(driver)  then  class SpeedTest:     def __init__(self, driver):         self.driver = driver  It makes sense since your SpeedTest class can't do anything without a web driver, so you can constrain instantiation to require a driver. Then you could easily test other web drivers if you so needed.  Third, Some naming schemes don't sit well with me. speedtest.get_data()  Implies that it would return some form of data. But that's not what's happening. Also, what happens if you call get_data() before you call run_test(driver)?  It looks like you'll just log that you couldn't find the data, which is good, but there's probably a safer way to deal with the workflow here.  Anyway, it's a good script. There's a lot of room for improvement and plenty of ground to get lost in feature creep ;-p   
You're awesome, this is exactly what I was hoping for.  Thank you for taking the time to go through it and provide clear, actionable recommendations.  
No problem. It's a really good exercise to write something small like this, then spend time refactoring it based on best practices. I always recommend reading Clean Code by Robert C. Martin. You can find pdfs of it online. Excellent read. Would definitely help you out.  
I've been looking for a 'best practices' book like that for a while - thanks for the recommendation! What would you say the prerequisites are for being able to comprehend a book like that? (E.g. I've taken a couple intro programming classes and written some scripts at work, could I jump into that book?)  
It has tons of actual code, but doesn't require much programming experience. It's a good book for beginners.  
Probably. I would also recommend that you read "The clean coder". I'ts the story about how he(Robert?) came to understand and appreciate the practice of writing clean code.  
Started reading this book recently and it's great.  
Do you know of any subs where you can structurally criticize code and have your code reviewed?    
There's /r/codereview but it's not too big or active. not sure what else  
Also stack exchange  
Here are a few other random suggestions:   No need for so many getters.  All they do is return self.something, so there's no need for self.get_something()--just use self.something directly.  Some people think it's future-proofing, but that's not necessary with Python, because properties allow attributes to become methods without changing the API.  Strongly recommend using the logging module.  Saves a lot of time and adds a lot of flexibility and future-proofing.  In SpeedTest.get_data(), is TimeoutException really the one you're looking for?  Besides that, you could likely put all of those into a single try clause with a single except clause.  If it is actually necessary to do each one separately, it would be better to use a dict and a loop instead of writing out each try/except by hand.  Kudos on using whitespace.  I never cease to be amazed at the number of scripts I see in any language that have tens or hundreds of lines of code without any blank lines logically dividing them.  Lisp can sort-of get away with that, but in most languages it just makes it unreadable.  Suggestion: go all the way with PEP-8.  Use docstrings in your classes, methods, and functions.  They will help you in the future, when you return to this project after a 3-6 month break and wonder what does what.  Only takes a few seconds, and it also helps you write better code now.  The Twitter.test_results() function doesn't seem to belong in the Twitter class.  Generally, all classes should have an __init__ function.  Your Config class can sort of get away without one, since it's basically just storing config data, but since it does read from a file, it would be better to instantiate it yourself.  When you're putting together long, potentially multiline strings, it's generally more readable to use interpolation than concatenation, but I suppose this is a matter of preference.  The new f-strings in Python 3.6 will be really nice.  Overall, this is a really nice start, a lot cleaner than a lot of projects I see thrown onto GitHub.  Thanks for sharing, and keep up the good work.  I found this through a friend of mine who has a local cable provider that often gives very poor performance, and he may be making use of it to shame his ISP.  :D  
Thank you.    Those did feel redundant, you were right about the thinking I was 'future proofing' part. That's perfect. This one I should have done already, I know better than to repeat myself 4 times :\ Thanks! Docstrings look awesome, I love documentation so I can definitely see the value. Yeah I can definitely see that, maybe stick it in a new class Output() or something similar? Is it bad practice to declare an empty list or variable inside the init? Well I haven't had much practice with interpolation so sounds like a good thing to try implementing on this project.  Thanks again, I really appreciate the help and encouragement it's incredibly helpful to get this kind of feedback.  
Nicely worded advice, thanks for contributing that.  Useful general knowledge for classes   
Can I ask, as a relative newbie - what's with all the underscores? Why use two at a time?  
the double underscore denotes a magic method. when you use a magic method, "you don't have to invoke it directly. The invocation is realized behind the scenes." [source] If, when you create a class, you add an __init__ method, that method will be called automatically when that class is instantiated; you don't have to do manually do myinstance.__init__().   
Thanks!  
Should have just submitted a pull request at this point :p  
I thought of it but decided to leave the refactoring as an exercise for OP.   
Also, now /r/learnprogramming gets to see the suggestions and why they're important!  
I second this idea.  I like that it was explained here, I wouldn't have seen the explanation otherwise.  
Happy Cake Day  
People like you are why I love reddit and this subreddit! Thanks!  
Found the code reviewer. We need more people like you  
Awesome!   
Very cool!  If you have an interruption will it tweet them when it comes back online?  "Just so you know, ISP, my service was disconnected last night from xxxx to xxxx."  
I really like that idea. I think modifying something like this script I wrote this past weekend to monitor my modem's RF signal levels would be better for that application. That way instead of just a failed page load throwing an exception you could still keep logs / gather whatever information actually is available. (I am still able to access my modems gateway when it has no connection).  
This is amazing.  
I almost wish my ISP was crappy enough to run these.  Almost. Thanks charter! Always get my advertise speed (and often more!)  
Google Fiber has spoiled me.  @GoogleFiber Hey what gives! I pay for Gigabit download and upload. Why am I only getting 950Mbps down and 995Mbps up?   
/me patiently waits for the day of >100Mb service..  
I just wish I could get more than 1mb up.  
I just wish I could get more than 1mb down  
This is how castes are set in the US. You need an internet connection to get a good job in some places.   
My internet + cable bill is $120 /month. 2 megabytes (20mbits) download and like 1 upload. My mom has satellite internet and she high atrocious ping like 700ms. But her download speeds are faster than mine are.   
fuck you   fuck me?   
Ditch cable. That's half the problem.  20mbit internet is suitable for most things.  Your speed is right around DSL standards.   
[deleted]  
I don't. I've heard your reports for years. I wouldn't be able to deal with the computer parts pricing.  
or Canada if you don't want to get eaten by wildlife.  
I just moved and got 150. It's glorious.   
How's that 995Mbps number being measured? By default, provided the actual transmission rate is 1gbit/s (I don't have Google Fiber, so I can't say for sure) then when considering ethernet packet overhead, you shouldn't be able to exceed 985Mbps.  
I'm not sure, those numbers are about the highest I've seen for each however. I just remoted in to my home desktop and got 948 down and 973 up.  
Wtf, are you serious? How much does that cost? (assuming the joke hasn't gone over my head)  
I'd imagine it's actually just an OC-48 connection, perhaps limited upstream. In that case, they may well give you just over 1 Gbit/s of raw bandwidth so speed tests can register 1000 Mbit/s.  
Saaaame. I have literally nothing to complain about with my ISP anymore...   
I don't know how I'm going to live my life if I ever move somewhere without google fiber   
I moved from an apartment to a house recently and spent a month without it. Luckily I could use another 'gigabit' fiber service but it maxed out at about 400Mbps down and about 450Mbps up. Functionally pretty good (compared to alternatives), but they constantly had random hours of outages that made it very frustrating.  
Just know I hate you.  
[deleted]  
I average roughly a third of the advertised speed with Charter.  
What city!  
I'm in a suburb of St Louis, which is where they have most of their offices, and I even work for Charter at one of their datacenters.  
You should try checking if your modem supports the speeds you pay for. Been paying for 250 down 10 up with Comcast and was only getting 100~ down. My modem only supported up to 100~ mbits. Upgraded my modem and started getting the speeds I've been paying for. Hope this helps you out.  
It does, problem is with lines in the neighborhood.  
Out of curiosity, what area?  
After going from Charter to Comcast, back to Charter, back to Comcast, back to Charter again, then back to Comcast, and now back to Charter again...can I just say I fucking love Charter? I don't even give a shit about advertised speeds, the fact I never need to check it or worry about data caps is abso-fucking-lutely amazing  
Same, Charter is the least terrible of them all. Sometimes I have service issues in my area but usually my speeds are at or above advertised.  
I bumped to a business account and it's actually not much more expensive, and the service you get is great.   
I have Time Warner, pay for 30/5 and get ~36/~6.5. Honestly, besides the high cost, never had a problem with Time Warner.   
Yep. The cost is killing me. It looks like every few months they find a new expired deal that bumps up my monthly payment a few bucks, and then I have to sit on the phone for an hour to get them to revert it...   
time warner and charter are the same company now ;P. https://www.timewarnercable.com/en/support/faqs/our-company/charter-twc-merger/twc-charter-merger-information.html  
Well, I haven't seen anything different besides their new Spectrum vans.  I was told my city was going to get speed boosts and then they decided not to. Oh well. Less competition for them, less money in our pockets.   
Charter took over TWC where I live. Costs the same for 100mbps as it costs for 300 with TWC. I don't like Charter.  
Charter took over TWC in the town I work in.  There was no 300 TWC plan. At least the customer support will be better.   
No doubt. My promised up and down speeds are regularly exceeded.  Still, I wish the up speed was less puny. Could be worse. 60/6 aint too bad. 100/20 tho!  
[deleted]  
hissss! I pay $40/mo., but that goes up to $60 after 1 year anniversary. It's the only game in town. Not too bad, it could be a lot worse. 100/100 though! at $45! That is wow.  
Did they up their 100mb plan to 20 up? If so, I'll be switching in a heartbeat.   
Yeah I need to set up a monitor on mine it's that bad.  Consistent, fast service for ~23 hours of the day. About an hour of it, it drops to 10% of the performance on download, upload, and latency. No clue what's happening with it but it'd be nice to have some monitoring and data collection on it.   
My plan says 16mb/s download. Which is already shitty enough from what I read and see on the internet. Then it says "Due to technical difficulties it is limited to 3mb/s download" and even later down the plan it says again "Due to technical difficulties it is limited to 300kb/s download". Thank   
Yeah, I have Time Warner and though they are a pain, they are usually pretty reliable. I have the 200 mbps plan, and they are usually +/-10 or so.  
Same. Recently bought a house in an area with a very reasonable, and fair ISP. ESPN3 included, speeds always over the theoretical maximums you pay for, no data cap, doesn't slow down around 5pm, local customer service (regional at least, ) and more.   
Same here. My Cable One has been pretty much flawless. It may only be 50Mbps down and 5Mbps up - but hey it's unlimited and plenty fast enough for cordcutters.  
After moving and being forced into Comcast, I fucking dream of the days where I had Charter.  
Now if only it included a test for high latency and jitter. One of my client's Comcast connection has not suffered from bandwidth drops but it has from high latency during peak hours. I have seen latency measurements approaching 100ms and jitter of about 80ms. This makes VoIP calls and video conferences difficult.  
Check the code -> it scrapes and logs both latency and jitter, they're just not included in the tweet.  We would just need to add default values for them and a conditional to test the scraped values against the defaults.  
Awesome!  
Your title is confusing. Time Warner and Comcast are not related. Charter absorbed TWC and Brighthouse. Comcast is off doing its own thing, completely separate from everyone else like they always have.  
It's actually kind of triggering me because he did the same thing in his last post, and someone corrected him in the comments, and he acknowledged the correction. This guy just doesn't learn  
Oh he has learned. Learned the way of the karma. If you can stuff as many of the most hated companies on Reddit into the headline you're guaranteed to get more karma.   
Yes, quite.  Comcast (Xfinity) and Time Warner (now Spectrum) are two entirely different companies.  The latter having somewhat of a better customer service model.    
How do you account for other devices using bandwidth (cell phone sync'ing photos over wifi, for example) while your script runs?   
Wondering this as well.  
This is a great question and should be higher up.   
I made a similar script in powershell for my Optus Cable connection, I made sure that all download heavy software was paused during the test from the same script. Reliable data is good data  
You can either schedule it to run when your network is not being heavily used or submit a pull request to add that functionality.  I submitted this for code review not as a production ready solution.  
How dare you! Have you not visited XfinityFACTS.com? In your arrogance and hubris, you question the benevolent service of Great Leader Comcast. Your treasonous ways shall be your undoing! Just check out this tasty FACT for your brainspace! Case closed. Now swear your fealty to Great Leader Comcast and perhaps you will be allowedd to live out your days at the labor camps service centers, working in service to the People's Champion. Great Leader Comcast is most merciful and wise.  
You have been promoted to moderator of /r/Pyongyang  
I can't be the only one that loves the fact Verizon replied to your cancellation tweet. That's pure gold - https://twitter.com/A_Comcast_User/status/780951637741318145  
I don't have speed issues with my Comcast, just losing internet all the time, so much so that I paid $10 just to get a program to track it.  I was working on programming my own but I was kind of on a time crunch so I could go to them with some kind of proof.  I work from home so internet is kind of a big deal, not to mention I don't have cell service at home so if I lose internet I lose my cell signal from my Microcell as well. Here's an example of my internet loss this month:   Date Failure Start Length    12/1/2016 8:53:39 AM 0:02:24   12/1/2016 9:26:40 AM 0:14:56   12/1/2016 9:54:25 AM 0:00:34   12/1/2016 9:55:31 AM 0:04:55   12/1/2016 11:01:10 AM 0:01:31   12/1/2016 11:03:13 AM 0:01:01   12/1/2016 11:08:51 AM 0:00:08   12/1/2016 11:44:13 AM 0:00:09   12/1/2016 11:49:30 AM 0:07:32   12/1/2016 11:57:34 AM 0:03:08   12/1/2016 1:15:40 PM 0:00:08   12/1/2016 1:22:58 PM 0:00:27   12/1/2016 5:19:21 PM 0:00:10   12/1/2016 5:30:30 PM 0:32:22   12/1/2016 6:04:57 PM 0:00:09   12/1/2016 6:09:46 PM 0:03:30   12/1/2016 6:15:20 PM 0:00:06   12/1/2016 6:55:44 PM 0:00:11   12/1/2016 6:56:49 PM 0:01:16   12/1/2016 6:58:37 PM 0:00:17   12/2/2016 1:28:14 PM 0:04:25   12/2/2016 1:45:58 PM 0:01:53   12/4/2016 9:01:45 AM 0:00:11   12/4/2016 9:02:29 AM 0:00:24   12/4/2016 1:33:38 PM 0:20:43   12/4/2016 1:57:58 PM 0:00:06   12/4/2016 4:18:05 PM 0:02:11   12/5/2016 11:00:25 AM 0:03:29   12/5/2016 11:05:28 AM 0:02:38   12/5/2016 11:08:39 AM 0:00:15   12/5/2016 11:10:28 AM 0:01:16   12/5/2016 11:12:17 AM 0:00:09   12/6/2016 4:55:19 PM 0:00:06   12/7/2016 7:07:12 AM 0:00:07   12/7/2016 10:51:13 AM 0:00:42   12/7/2016 10:53:29 AM 0:00:05   12/7/2016 10:59:14 AM 0:00:21   12/7/2016 11:18:30 AM 0:00:10   12/7/2016 11:21:18 AM 0:01:50   12/7/2016 11:23:40 AM 0:00:42   12/7/2016 11:27:01 AM 0:00:17   12/7/2016 11:27:50 AM 0:00:22   12/7/2016 11:28:45 AM 0:06:58   12/7/2016 11:40:18 AM 0:01:00   12/7/2016 12:00:57 PM 0:00:14   12/7/2016 1:39:56 PM 0:03:54   12/7/2016 1:44:55 PM 0:00:14   12/7/2016 1:46:46 PM 0:00:05   12/7/2016 1:47:23 PM 0:00:11   12/7/2016 1:48:06 PM 0:01:25   12/7/2016 2:09:31 PM 0:00:51   12/7/2016 3:09:01 PM 0:00:56   12/12/2016 2:05:00 PM 0:00:50   12/13/2016 9:14:08 AM 0:00:34   12/13/2016 9:16:15 AM 0:02:03   12/13/2016 9:20:22 AM 0:00:17   12/13/2016 9:26:47 AM 0:01:01   12/13/2016 9:28:50 AM 0:01:29   12/13/2016 10:46:11 AM 0:03:47   12/13/2016 10:58:08 AM 0:00:18   12/13/2016 1:23:13 PM 0:00:06   12/13/2016 1:23:51 PM 0:01:48   12/13/2016 1:26:11 PM 0:00:57   It doesn't happen every day, but it happens often enough.  No real explanation, Nov 21-Dec 1 I had enough outages each day that they refunded me 10 days of service.  Not much money but it helps I guess.    
Sounds like that program paid for itself already.   
Oh definitely, it's also the quickest way for me to know my internet is back as well since it keeps pinging the servers and alerts me when one is reached.  Generally it takes my PC a couple minutes to show "no internet access" down in the status bar.  Of course if I have a phone call or video stream going, I'll know right away when I lose it.  
They really hate to do it, but I'd ask if they were willing to swap out the modem. I had one with a leaky capacitor that you could hear squeaking if you put your ear up next to it.  
Not to burst your bubble, but your modem automatically keeps a log of connection errors. Log into the admin panel and look for the error logs you'll probably see a shit ton. Lookup a handy guide that explains what different error codes mean, it looks like you might be getting "T3 timeouts". This happens when: 1. Bad modem.  2. Ingress/egress somewhere on your line.  3. Lots of noise. Essentially what happens with T3 timeouts is your modem is adjusting its processing power to compensate with the issues on the line. Eventually it can't keep up, it drops connection and reconnects after about a minute. Source: ex twc tier 3 support tech  
If you don't mind, what program are you using for this?  
Sure I use this one https://netuptimemonitor.com/ Wasn't trying to post it like I was a shill for them but it's damn useful and I've been using it for months.  
I have issues with my bandwidth regularly getting strangled in the evenings (from 25mbps to 0.8-1.3mbps), so I'm on the look out for something to help me observe patterns and make a case to my ISP.  Thanks for sharing!  
I pay for 25mbps from comcast and almost always test at 30mbps, except when service is being weird and it's at 0.5. But still, on average I definitely get more than I pay for.  
Your one of the lucky ones. I'm paying for 150Mb/s and get only 40Mb/s.   
You pay for "up to" 150Mb/s, so anything over 0 is within contract. U-Verse rep actually said this to me.  
It's true the contract says up to but it means between you're current plan and the next lowest, not 0. If you pay for 18 it's supposed to be from 12-18. If you're getting under the next lowest tier consistently, then you're not getting what you payed for. The next lowest plan is probably 100Mb, though I think some areas have a 75 or 90 plan on fiber.  
Thank you for explaining that.  So many times I see people getting angry about this when they don't understand what they're actually paying for or why, and they just get mad.  I've tried to explain it before but usually just get downvoted.    
You're paying for UP TO 150 mbps  
I'll be paying up to the amount suggested on my bill, proportional to what I was delivered.  
Suggested this to someone else, but check to see if your modem supports the speeds you're paying for. Some cases it's hardware and some cases it's the service.  
If you don't mind my asking where do you live? Because I'm in the same boat as the person you replied to.  
I'm going to take a guess: You have an 802.11n modem and using WiFi with some interference, like maybe 1 or 2 walls in between. That is the max speed you can get in those conditions. Have you tried a wired speed test?  
You're paying for up to 150, but consistently getting 40 is still misleading advertising on their part. You can file a complaint with the FCC. I do it about once per year. I magically receive great service for about 10 months and then i guess I fall off the list of snitches and I have to complain again.   
and this is when you test straight from the modem?  
Start a post over at /r/Comcast_Xfinity and someone clueful can check into this. There is no good reason that you would have regular results that bad. There are about a thousand things that can cause it. Might as well get it fixed and get the speeds you're paying for.  
Have you verified your local equipment? Crap hardware and non-optimal settings can have an affect on performance. For example, if you have QoS enabled or you're using the 2.4ghz band for wireless on a crowded channel. Often times you will get vastly improved performance with a commercial, off-the-shelf router and modem rather than the one they rent to you.  
Given how often my internet speed dips down I would probably get blocked after a couple days if I used this.  
Nice, this could be put in a Raspberry Pi Zero and be running continuously on your network  
I did exactly this with a program I wrote to clone a twitter account (will auto-follow/unfollow users as the target to clone does, clones their profile background and avatar and, of course, tweets the same thing the target does (within a minute)) Have a raspberry pi just sitting on my desk doing it, love it.   
...Why would you want to do that?  
It sounded easy enough for someone with a beginner's level of experience with Python, I wanted an excuse to purchase a Raspberry Pi, and I had nothing better to do.  
Hmm maybe to steal an upcoming personality's followship.  
For someone who's been dealing with 1mb upload speeds for a month now, I need this.   
Thank you and FUCK comcast.  
There is a speedtest module for python, which should alleviate the need to use selenium.  
I want to hug you right now.  Seriously - thanks.  
An upvote or reddit gold would be preferred -- you're most welcome.  
So, on the topic of shitty ISPs: What is the best way to protest ISP contracts? Not sign up for them? Ultimately, you're just giving the ISP more money that way. I'm just so frustrated with this system right now. I'd just sign up for another, but the closest competitor has shitty speeds and occupation depends on a good connection.  
Talk with your state's utility commision. Theres different ways for each state. That or get a lawyer involved. They always can find the loopholes. Lastly, get a business connection and request SLAs. You will be majorly paying for the last though.   
My state (Texas) Utility Commission has has conflicting information on their website. Some pages list internet as outside their jurisdiction. Some pages don't list Internet as outside their jurisdiction...  
SLA?   
Service Level Agreement. Its a common business term, meaning two parties agree to do something within a set period of time, or suffer consequences (normally financial setbacks, etc).   
Very cool. Serious question: What's to stop ISP's from ramping up speeds when they detect you (or anyone really) are contacting a popular speed test site?  
They actually do this already, under the guise of "Speed Boost" to help you buffer videos so they start faster. What it really does is give one speed for the first X seconds, then drop to the normal lower speed after that. It also fools/spoofs most speed tests.   
This....This is why I'm spending time learning python right now.  Screw network automation.  
Keep up the fight! You're helping all of us by doing this.   
I need to do this, this is awesome. My Comcast service is shoddy most of the time  
Can you do this for Cable One in Northern AZ, those fucks lie constantly.   
You can change which ISP you tweet at in the config file.  Just change 'isp' : '@comcast' to Cable One's twitter account.  
After buying my own modem and writing a complaint letter to the FTC Comcast sent out a Comcast tech (not a contractor) and rewired my whole outside cable box.  I pay $80 for 150/25, and usually get about 195/25.  
I made a subreddit, /r/ispshame, but it never took off.  
I am going to modify this to email my schools IT department and president and dean of students offices. Our Wifi has gotten to the point where it is literally unusable, but if you ask the school, they think it is great!   
[deleted]  
Yup it's called speed boost. It's great to get your videos pre buffered, and to trick speed tests.   
I dont disagree with you, but if a simple speed test cant maintain the advertised speeds, why would one expect a sustained test to resolve positively?  
I have learned through the basics of python but where do you go to learn how to make stuff like this?  
If you've learned the basics you're going to want to move on to trying to understand how to use libraries. Find a library that does what you need it to do then learn how to use it. If you don't have pip installed I would highly recommend getting it. It makes installing libraries incredibly easy.  
 Comcast(Time Warner)  Wtf does this even mean?  
That he doesn't know as much about who he pays for cable as he does about coding. Two totally separate companies.  
Or it is a clickbait title. He actually has TWC but puts Comcast because people flock to Comcast reddit posts.  
I think it is a throwback to his first python program where he interchanged the companies by accident.  
I support this.  You should branch out and give it to more comcast users.  make it do more than twitter,  inundate them with emails, facebooks and twitter.   Hell include a major media twitter handles so it annoys them too. Put preassure on them.  
Brilliant. Now we can backup arguments and complaints about our ISP with automated statistics. AND publically 'advertise' their service. Imagine giving it to laypersons, congregating the data...     
You're not getting what you're paying for because we're running out of internet!!!! Net neutrality is killing us, so really it's your own fault you have bad internet for resisting our lobbyists who are doing the lord's work and trying to make life better for everyone*. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†   *By everyone we mean us, it's not our fault if you don't read this.  
4 cones!  
My understanding is that (for a regular shared home internet package -- shared meaning shared among the community as opposed to a truly private line) those speeds are only valid up to the host -- i.e. you should be able to get 100/10 for example to Comcast's (if that's your company) nearest network point. From there on, in the wilds of the vast internet, the speeds depend on peering deals and routing and much other stuff. That's my understanding at least. The point being, there may be PR value in saying I'm only getting 24/3 out of 100/10, but it probably isn't a violation of their contract and service agreement unless you can prove the numbers are off against the expected node (the nearest server @ comcast).  
I also pay for 100mb/S. On a good day i get 3mb/s....  
Holy crap. This is AMAZING  
What the hell does Comcast have to do with Time Warner?  
This won the internet!!!  
Is there a guide on how to do this for non-programming folks? Coding never really appealed to me, but I could prolly figure it out if you wouldn't mind pointing me in the right direction. I ask because I just "cut the cord" and I'm sure I'm getting hosed a bit on my speeds.   
I would pay money for something like this that was easy enough for dum dums like me to use. You may be onto something  
I wonder if your bot would gain more traction/attract more attention if you could vary the format in which it's posted, this why it doesn't always start out with "hey, what gives?" and doesn't seem too repetitive.   
So how do I set this up myself?  I have an HTPC that is always on and next to my modem.  
I must be in such the minority or maybe it's because I live in a rural area sandwiched between two sprawling metros but I pay for 50MB and get 120-135 most days.  
om  
I moved to NYC earlier this year and am stuck with Time Warner Cable. The connection blows. I am going to run this to collect data so that I can complain more effectively.  
what speed are u subscribed to?  
Doing god's work.  
The comments in here are like net neutrality is already dead.  
I'd like to setup my rasberry pi to tweet things/use twitter. Where can I learn to do something similar? Do i need to build some sort of a webcrawler?  
Check out Selenium.  That's what this uses to navigate browser, press buttons, and save values.   Another user mentioned pythons SpeedTest module - kinda makes the web scraping part unnecessary because you could just use that but it's still cool to know how to do.   For example: http://mongr.co  I built this site's database using selenium by crawling sites like Gazelle.com, Usell.com, and a bunch of others  
What is the link between Comcast and TWC? Time Warner is owned by Charter.  
I was about to say the same thing. Those are two different companies. It's Charter now (formally TWC)  
You should develop a Windows store app for this, I'd use it since I program to save my life and most people are like me (lazy).  
ugh. I wish I knew enough programming to do this for my internet provider. My city is stuck into a monopoly with its internet provider. It's ridiculous with the speeds we put up with.  
Any chance we could see some source from your project?  
How would I go about installing this on my Windows box? Not asking for a step-by-step, half the fun is figuring it out. However can you point me in the right direction? Thanks!  
You'll need python3 installed on your machine. Python ships with pip package manager, use that to install selenium(web crawler) and tweepy(twitter api).   Those are the only dependencies you will need but for Windows 64 bit you will also need to go into the config.json file that's included with the script and in the driver section change "binary" to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\Firefox.exe" aka the location of firefox binary assuming you haven't changed it.  
I'm not happy with Alaska Communications because they won't give me service due to the fact that their minimum speed is 10 Mbps. My wife and I bought a house this past April and the previous owner had DSL. I assumed because they had service, that we could get it. Big mistake. They were grandfathered in. So as a result I have $150/month satellite internet with a 30 GB data cap. I asked the DSL provider why they won't offer service below 10 Mbps, and they told me that they got tired of people signing up for slow speeds, and then bitching that they can't do all the things they want online. So they said fuck 'em. I'd take that unlimited 3 Mbps over this any day.  
Man i wish i had half that speed. I pay for 10mb down 1 up and i get 800 kb down and like 100 kb up  
That would be effective if they cared. Just don't be late with that monthly payment.  
The offer to help get your issues fixed still stands from your previous post.   
I pay for 40 down and get barely 1.5. The UK is just as bad in this respect.  
Hoping Comcast greases you up?  
Should utilize a hashtag of some sort so that these tweets are traceable.   
I think it would be pretty hilarious if they had a tweet bot to respond the standard shit solutions.   
Imagine if everyone was running a script like this that automatically detected their ISPs. We may have competition then. #comcastSpeedFail is trending!  
just a quick question, has anyone come checked your line/ coaxial run?  
This is a level of petty I wish to achieve  
Congrats man! I‚Äôm ‚Äúlearning‚Äù to code, and my parents think I‚Äôm some kind of prodigy, but I haven‚Äôt even touched my editor since school got out. I‚Äôm glad you have the dedication to learn something that I don‚Äôt. But I may revisit it after this post! Thanks for the motivation!  
Yeah man, a little bit every day. There were a few days in there I was only able to do 1 hour, and I counted that as a win.  
And with Udemy I find that even in an hour you can learn a lot depending on the instructor! Congrats on your journey so far :)  
I learned more with Udemy than in school. I remember we had some teacher and we wrote Hello world program in C++ for 8 hours. 1 hour at least went to him opening a web browser and then Google asked to accept the terms etc (which is normal when they update their privacy statements etc) and he started talking stuff like: "What is this? You see? Even Google has bugs" etc‚Ä¶ School was really a turn off for me.  
Especially when it feels half assed and one course costs $500+. Really hard justifying it for anything but that degree. However if you like it enough, you‚Äôre gonna do a project and it‚Äôs going to show your love for your craft.  
It is more important to build a habit than to rely on motivation(whatever that is) if you want to succeed in life.  
Literally the key to success is building successful habits.  
^ When I started getting back into coding, I coded every Thursday (This was in November) but I eventually made it a habit to code a bit every day, now since January I‚Äôve learnt HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and Python!  
You're so smart, I can't even get the basics of JS in a month, I moved on to Python as this seems a lot better.  
The basics of programming are pretty much the same in the most popular languages. So if you‚Äôre learning python basics then you will be better at js as well!  
ah, i started with JS and is nowlearning C++  
A lot of concepts "clicked" for me when I started learning some Python after introductory JavaScript.  
This. This right here I struggle with so much. Motivation only lasts so long for me how do you properly build a habit? That's a simple question I probably know the answer too but I'm wondering what someone else thinks or if you have any tips  
I read somewhere that a habit sticks at about 40 days. Just don't put too much on your plate. Doing a little bit every day is way better than 5 hours in one day and then leave it for another day, week, month, etc.  
That makes sense. Yeah I'm trying to do about 30 min to an hour a day. Otherwise I lose it  
Lucky you. I remember when I started to learn to code, my parents thought I was a useless piece of shit doing nothing etc. Now I really want to start coding again, but I lack of time. Please, dedicate every free moment to coding.  
I feel you man. Been in a slump to learn coding myself. I hope we can get our perseverance to learn coding again.  
Wow dude I'm "learning" to code too but my parents both think I'm wasting my time  
I‚Äôm convinced there is something super valuable about not telling anyone about the work you are doing.  I am trying to decide how to best go about learning to code currently and will use this post as guidance. Thank you!  
There was a study done about this. Basically, if you tell people "I'm going to lose 50lbs, just started with this diet and this exercise routine, blahblahblah," you've already received a lot of positive feedback. No need to DO anything after that! But by keeping quiet until after the fact, you don't settle for the positive compliments, you're motivated to earn them. Something like that.  
Exactly. I've taught myself other things in the past (with much less rigor, and results), but I think there was something about that delayed gratification the pushed me forward this time. Hopefully that isn't all undone now lol.  
Can confirm. I‚Äôve told people I wanna goto law school and I was getting constant compliments. I didn‚Äôt feel so great after. I‚Äôm still going for it, but it‚Äôs a different feeling when you can surprise them.  
Exactly, also the pressure is off that way!  
To add to this, your brain actually releases the same chemicals associated with the "doing" part of the activity you are talking about. You get the same sense of "completion" of a hard task, although more shallow and shorter lasting, but it's enough to throw some people off the tracks.  
just comment hopping, please watch this TED talk on not telling people your goals, really interesting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHopJHSlVo4 If I remember right, the creator of Spanx wasn't telling anyone except for her husband, for like a year or something.  
THIS!! This is what always  happening to me, every time I want to improve myself on things that I like I always telling this to my friends and guess what after just a week or a month I already lost my motivation to do it. And the funny thing is  I also realized the fact that this "jinx" will always happen whenever I tell to someone that's why I'm now avoiding this and just do what I want to do.  
I have read this as well. Although, there is the counterpoint that social contracts made by vocalizing your goal force you to step up and do the work when you do not want to. But I call bullshit on the latter theory. Work hard in silence and let success make the noise.  
And then there's studies that tell you to tell people because then the thought of being held accountable will keep you going  
Exactly. It's much more satisfying telling someone, 'hey I built this thing's than saying 'hey I will build this other thousand things, someday'  
So I read something about this a few years ago and never actually put it into practice until now.  The theory goes, when you share your goals you get a similar social reward to actually accomplishing your goal. As a result, the motivation to actually achieve it is somewhat diminished considering you can get a little serotonin boost just from mentioning it to your friends.  Idk if this is true, but there is something about the idea of just saying to my family in 6 months "Oh btw I'm a developer now" (this has yet to happen but since my family isn't on reddit, it's still a possibility) that's kinda exciting.  
On the flip side, someone who takes themself more seriously might actually find motivation by putting a goal out there and striving to achieve it, but this is dependent upon having a social group that will hold you to task. If I tell my friends / family ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do XYZ in 6 months‚Äù and fail, without having even put in solid effort, it‚Äôs extremely embarrassing  
Yeah. This is me as well. I found that if I keep it to myself it makes it easier to justify to myself that I can procrastinate doing other things which is obviously dumb.  
A little A a little B. I don't disagree with the notion. I think the difference is posting on social media vs talking IRL.  
I regret not knowing about this later. Before I share it with someone nowadays I will be 100% sure they will be a positive force. I had someone tell me "well, that's just tic-tac-toe. it won't make you money" when I shared with them a project I was doing for learning's sake. I then had another who tried to be motivating... I think. But his reaction was so lukewarm that it only reinforced my already poor belief that my projects suck hard and I might fail to start a career. And now I read that positive comments may also give the impression that you already succeeded in doing something.  But then I realized, you're better off sharing your work with people who understand what you are doing and can appreciate the work that you're putting, give you constructive feedback and so on. I feel like sharing it with a non-techie person will at best make them smile "for social contract's sake".  
Man, I feel like I'm making some self-taught progress, and I have no idea how I'd tell a computer to recognize a diagonal line, without giving it the coordinates manually. Sounds like a good learning exercise to me!  
ive been saving up for to buy 2 switch (Nintendo not network switch) for me and my girlfriend without telling her and let me tell you that god am i excited and motivated  
CSS- The complete guide 2020 (Maximilian S., Udemy). I hated this course so much. Zero sense of aesthetics. The project and examples are so ugly. Just so hard to sit through. I dig Max's stuff but this one is so bad! Colt has a new series on youtube, I suggest you do that instead and get a refund for this.  
THANK YOU! Interesting. I spent a good amount of time reading reviews on Udemy yesterday for CSS courses, and none of them seemed to be getting consistently great reviews. I'll definitely start with Colts CSS series . Thank you for that recommendation.  
this!!! i requested a refund that same day i bought it  
I agree, that course is not good.  
I've heard good things about Jonas Schmedtmann's Advanced CSS course. I'm excited to get started - the projects look great  
How did you learn CSS before HTML, considering it's the language that dictates how HTML itself should be styled? And congrats!  
EXACTLY. It was a lot of "ohh that looks cool" and then back tracking and saying, you're not ready for that. I did the same thing with React and JavaScript. Trying to get better about shiny objects.  
This might be a little early for you, but something that can truly help your programming and software development skills is the (free) Nand2Tetris courses on Coursera (Part 1 and 2). Part 1 gives you an understanding of the hardware and logical fundamentals that underlie all software, by walking you through the process of designing a very simple computer from scratch. Part 2 walks you through creating a programming language of your own - understanding how languages are built and work under the hood can help you to appreciate the most effective ways to use them. The course is really well put together, with all sorts of materials available, and taught me a lot. It takes a task that seems gargantuan (creating a game of Tetris by first designing a computer and various levels of programming language) and make it really achievable - even if you have to scratch your head a fair bit too get through it at times! Good luck, and stay motivated Edit: typos  
That sounds off the wall. Reminds me of the Carl Sagan quote "If you want to make an apple pie from scratch you must first create the Universe."  
To add to what I've already said, don't take "this may be a little early for you" as "this is a really hard course, I should wait for years when I feel like a pro to do it". If you're at the point where you're comfortable writing programs to solve simple problems, you have some free time, and you don't have other projects that you're currently excited about, give Nand2Tetris a go.  
This sounds amazing! Thank you for the resource  
I've been looking for something exactly like this.  
This is amazing, and so thorough! Congrats on your work, and thank you for this breakdown. I've been stood down from my job for a month due to COVID-19 and decided to ~finally~ spend some time doing personal study and upskill, so I'm effectively trying to set myself up for success as of about an hour ago (when you posted this). This is super motivating and a great guide. (Especially as someone prone to distraction!)  
Thanks I really appreciate it. I'm a big fan of starting small and staying consistent. Even just an hour a day can seriously add up.  
This is incredible. I suppose I should invest some time in a lesson plan because random spurts aren't getting me going as fast as I'd like.  
Totally! A really great book I read to help develop mine was "Ultra Learning" by Scott Young.  
Wow, thank you. My partner and I are both educators looking at this lesson plan going "Holy shit this is some advanced stuff" haha, so kudos, really! Must be a good read.  
I thought I'd recognized some of his concepts in your post! :D I'm glad to see so many more people trying that approach.  
I feel like I am your twin. I listened to him on The Art of Manliness podcast and started at the same time as you.  
I honestly don't get why people shit on YouTube so much. It's honestly the only thing you need to learn programming. You will find literally everything about anything, and if a video lacks in explanation just do what actual programmers do and look up the documentation.  
I find the problem with video tutorials whether it's on YouTube or on Udemy or another website is that it gives you a false sense of competency when you're simply copying what the instructor is doing. This can all be avoided if you pause the video, take a few minutes to come up with your own solution, but a lot of people, including myself sometimes, are scared to let go of the hand-holding you get from them.  If you're completely new to the topic videos are a great start to get a feel for it, but you gotta attempt it on your own and/or modify what was created from the video into something different.  
Thats with everything tbh, the videos are there for you to learn the syntax.  
Learning beginner concepts on YouTube is unstructured, which is not effective for beginners. That is unless you find a playlist in which case YMMV  
I've been too depressed to learn how to code. I wish I could make better use of my time. And also I'm really afraid I'm going to work super hard for no reason and not get a job or have that job be minimum wage or something. Everyone is learning how to code and I don't have a degree either.  
I‚Äôm a developer. I have no degree and I never did code boot camps or online courses. Shit, I don‚Äôt think those even existed like they do now when I started.  My recommendation is this- get a job at some sort of tech company. Preferably a small one. With some job like answering phone calls for a help desk. It‚Äôs low paying but it‚Äôs a foot in the door. Learn everything you can about the business and outperform every coworker. Start to solve problems. Take initiative to write code to solve those problems.  Not saying that‚Äôs THE answer, but that‚Äôs exactly what I did. And I have a very good career years later as a senior developer.  ‚ÄúLearning‚Äù is great. But ‚Äúinitiative‚Äù is priceless.  
As someone who walk through the same path as your, mu experience in customer support really important as a developer. One is you will learn how to communicate effectively. Secondly, the complaint you received from customer really open my eyes on what consider a good UI/UX or not.  
Just complete the freeCodeCamp responsive design certificate. It will get your started, doing a little is better than doing nothing at all. For me personally, coding is difficult, what ive learned from my gripes and programming is that the answers are all out there, you just have to ask the right question. If you ever need some help, let me know!  
Going to try this one out after I‚Äôm done studying for a certifications I‚Äôm doing as a way to ease into a new subject .  
I nuked my last Reddit account, but made one just to respond to you. Quarantine sent me off a cliff of depression, and it's making me realize I've always been moderately depressed. The book Feeling Good by David Burns has helped so much I want to cry. It's home learning for a real therapy technique, and it works. The premise is basically that we have moods, thoughts, and actions. They all affect eachother, so it's easy to get knocked on your ass in a death spiral of: feeling like shit -> don't want to do anything -> that makes you feel worse -> you think you're lazy -> you feel worse etc etc etc You can't directly change your mood. You can directly change your actions and that works for mild mild depression, but what if you can't MAKE yourself do something? This book teaches you to recognize distorted thinking like:  I've been too depressed to learn how to code. I wish I could make better use of my time. And also I'm really afraid I'm going to work super hard for no reason and not get a job or have that job be minimum wage or something. Everyone is learning how to code and I don't have a degree either.  Read this article about common cognitive distortions (https://psychcentral.com/lib/15-common-cognitive-distortions/), and try to recognize when you're doing them. PM for how to get a copy of the book if you're interested.  
Based on the fact that you wrote this: "figuring out ‚ÄúThe right questions‚Äù to ask." and "YouTube: Avoid at all costs, honestly." - I think we can all agree you've learned, how to learn. I propose we bestow the title 'developer' to OP. Congratulations on the success.  
What they said about tools, I don't know how many times I've tried to dissuade beginners from focusing on the tools... Definitely give this person a golden keyboard.  
You‚Äôre a beast dawg. Thank you for sharing all of this. I‚Äôve kind of been doing the same thing as you, started in mid-January with fundamental knowledge of if/for, functions and super basic oop- no web knowledge though.  Also did the web developer boot camp- learned quite a bit too. Will say that I think YouTube is actually fantastic. Web Dev Simplified, Fireship, Dev Ed, Brad Traversy, say no more... Also the honeypot.io channel has some really great light watching just to get a feel for the web development industry as a whole, what problems people are facing and stuff like that when you don‚Äôt have the mental capacity to write code anymore. Along with stumbling through blog posts and official documentation (Mozilla developer network ‚Äúmdn‚Äù especially), it‚Äôs been a bumpy yet really fun ride so far. Building stuff has certainly been the most enlightening part of the process for me (I just make endless mistakes about things I thought I knew, negative reinforcement really works for me lol) but getting some basic introductions was definitely necessary. Not sure about you, but I‚Äôd say my biggest hurdle hasn‚Äôt been getting distracted from coding, but getting distracted by the infinite things to learn and make. Like, what am I even supposed to be doing and learning??  What‚Äôs helped me is just saying ‚Äúfk it, I‚Äôm doing this Udemy course and seeing it through for the next two weeks‚Äù and trying my best not to resource hop. I‚Äôve definitely gone down some rabbit holes, but I‚Äôll take that over the analysis paralysis of ‚Äúoooh but do I do Udemy, freecodecamp, that University of Helsinki class, codecademy...?‚Äù. Eventually, I started just picking stuff and doing it. Right now I‚Äôve been trying to figure out if I should pick up Typescript or learn a SPA framework. Well, I‚Äôm just gonna send it and commit to learning and using Vue in my projects for the next few weeks. After that, I‚Äôll zoom out and see what the next move is.  
 Like, what am I even supposed to be doing and learning??  I feel you. There's so much going on i'm not even sure what a web dev is supposed to be able to do to land a junior position.  
This is amazing. Thanks for sharing! I‚Äôm going to save this and reread it. I‚Äôve recently started my programming journey....from ground zero.  I have a few rough ideas of what type of programming I would like to do, but getting off the ground ‚Äúboot camp style‚Äù is rough.  I think I found a simple project at work that I can incorporate some basic programming knowledge into that will help me get through the foundational skills. Wrapping my head around these concepts for the first time takes plenty of practice and interaction...not just watching videos.  
Screw language specific syntax. You need to study object oriented design. Use the syntax and language as a tool to accomplish good design.  Start thinking in terms of OO from the get go and you'll save yourself a lot of grief in the end.  
It's weird for someone to be learning to code and not talk about it.  /s  
They probably are also vegan CrossFitters. Their self control knows no bounds.  
 A vegan, a crossfitter, and an Arch user walk into a bar and everyone knows because they won't stop talking about themselves  I think I got that one wrong,  but I'm going with it.  
Don't forget the 14 year olds who just discovered Atheism.  
Maybe this will be an unpopular opinion, but I don't think starting out with web development is really the best way to learn programming. I think it ends up discouraging a lot of people, and ends up spreading beginners too thin, giving them broad but very shallow knowledge. I'm not sure if it was a conscious choice that you made to start learning how to build web applications specifically, but it wouldn't surprise me if you ended up there entirely by accident. I've noticed that it's pushed very strongly these days. There are so many courses, videos, and "boot camps" that teach web development that it can seem to a beginner to be almost synonymous with development now. I'm not sure why it has become so common; I guess there's a high demand in the industry for web developers and it's something that allows you to quickly build fairly complex applications without much experience so perhaps that's it. When you look at these boot camps or courses that claim to get you from nothing to a development job in a year, 6 months, 3 months, or whatever, the result is lots of developers who only have a very shallow, surface level of understanding and knowledge. It's absolutely not their fault, but they've been given the large breadth of knowledge that's required for building something as complex as a modern web application, but there simply hasn't been enough time and focus while learning all of that breadth to really build much depth. If I gave you nothing more than a code editor and a Python interpreter, I can guarantee you that there are enough things to learn about programming with nothing more than those two tools to last you months, years even. However, if you're learning web development then as well as a programming language like Javascript or Typescript (as well as maybe another language such as Python or Ruby if you're building your back-end in something else), you're also learning other tools, technologies, concepts, and frameworks like HTML, CSS, Node.js, npm, React, Browser APIs, web sockets, REST, cookies etc. That's a lot of stuff, and to be honest the actual traditional "programming" part of that is fairly small. Mostly you're learning how to use all of these frameworks and tools and how to plumb them all together. As an analogy, imagine instead somebody who decided to start learning to program by building Android applications. So they start learning how to use Android Studio, how to work with the gradle build system, how to work with Android APIs, how to work with Activities and the Android permission system, APIs for using the camera, the accelerometer, the Google Play store etc. Sure, they've certainly learned some programming with Java or Kotlin, and sure some of the skills they've learned will be transferable to other domains, but I think it would be fair to say that they've probably spent a lot of time learning things that are fairly specific to Android development. And there's nothing necessarily wrong with that if their goal is to build Android mobile apps, but it's also fair to say I think that they've spent a lot of time learning some of the Android specifics that could instead have been spent learning more general programming. It's the same thing with web development I feel. As I mentioned above, I suspect starting with web development can also discourage a lot of people who find themselves just getting overloaded with information and overwhelmed. I've been programming for about 20 years now and I think even today I'd struggle to sufficiently pick up that many new technologies, tools, concepts and APIs within a few months! When I started learning, I basically had a code editor and a compiler and it still took me I would say at least a year to get to a level where I'd consider myself proficient, and that was before I learned anything like version control (though back then the only option was basically rcs), how to write build scripts, client/server programming, unit testing, how to manage dependencies in a complex project, how to effectively use a debugger etc. Maybe I'm just showing my age here, but if your goal is to learn general programming then I would suggest focusing instead with just one programming language to start with, and just a few tools. Learn the basics such as how to write conditional statements, loops, and functions, parameters and parameter passing, data types and variables, exceptions and exception handling, operators, string manipulation, data structures and collections such as arrays, maps, vectors, lists, queues, stacks etc. And, of course, learn how to actually use all of these things to solve programming problems (this is the hard part). Don't even start trying to learn how to use a version control system at first; wait at least a month or so until you're starting to get a hang of just programming before you also start trying to learn something as complex as git and github on top of that.  
Best of luck on your journey! I'll add a couple notes as someone who remembers just starting out in 2010, but who now has a lot of experience from studying, coding as a hobby, and coding as a professional: Stay humble and accept critique. Making mistakes isn't a sign of incompetence, everyone does it. Seek out advise from more experienced developers. Expand your toolbelt. There's a lot of best practices, style guides, frameworks, formats, languages, editors... Know how to use multiple so you can pick the best tool for the job. The perfect is the enemy of the good. There's so much to learn in this field! Prefer making crappy code that you learn from over scrapping code over and over because it's not good enough. That's a really easy trap to fall into.  
[removed]  
Best of luck man! We're all in the same boat here.  
Colt Steele is the man. His Python course is also great if you ever plan to learn this nice language. I'm glad you liked his react course, I'd like to start it in a few weeks when I'll have a bit more experience/knowledge about vanilla JS.  
it sounds like your rigorous "focus" noting and session timing is working against you. Why stop if the clock tells you to when your mind and body tell you otherwise? Sounds to me like youre training your brain to regularly break focus. Focus is a muscle that can be trained, and will be trained if you keep at coding. My attention span and focus have sky rocketed since properly started. The amount of stuff ive learned and understood when ive had what you'd call a break in focus is staggering, some of my best decisions have been made in the shower, at the store or doing something else, and my most enjoyable time spent coding has been when time has been all but forgotten. Its almost therapeutic, like mindfullness or some zen stuff like that. I dont know, havent really done that properly, but thats how I imagine its like. I think your whole approach to learning it in a fixed amount of time, timing your stuff etc. is just detrimental. Coding isnt physical labor, its not like stacking eggs in a carton, something you can easily measure. Its a mental and creative challenge, and that doesn't follow a clock. Some days you'll feel like you have done nothing, even though youve applied yourself properly to it, measuring and timing that is going to leave you with a sour taste in your mouth, even though all that fruitless struggle in reality was the most productive day you ever had, you just didn't reap the rewards the same day. Its easy to fall into this trap and think this way, I do it all the time, but it is just destructive way to look at it. Theres tons of research supporting this too, provision doesn't work on intellectual work, its a detriment, as it shifts focus from the real problem, towards the provision, and getting stuff done in such and such a way, on that time.  My advice would be to not force yourself to break focus, dont stress it, let your mind focus on the task at hand, not all this note taking and data collection on how youve spent your time. In that case, why not collect data on all the time youve wasted collecting data about your learning experience, to see how you could have spent your time more wisely?  im not saying dont take breaks, and dont go do something else, absolutely, some times you just need to back off, maybe youre in a rut, youve dug yourself so deep into a problem youve lost your bearings, doing something else can give you some space, and give you a new perspective. and like exercise, your mind also needs to recover.  
I couldn't agree more. A few points that maybe I wasn't super clear on in my word vomit post above.  The hour was just a benchmark. Before I started, I couldn't consistently keep my attention on coding. Some lessons I would completely glaze over. At those times I was lucky to go 30 minutes at a time, so thats why I was trying to build to 60. Which, is easy now and bordering (exactly like you're saying) holding me back a bit. I would code for about 3 hours a day. My shortest was just 1 hours and most was 6. But plenty of the day I would spend doing other things, and again exactly like you said. I would come up with my best solutions in my time daydreaming or when I was away from the computer.   What does a normal code block (or session coding, idk what the right term is) for you look like? Idk what it's like for actual devs because I haven't actually talked to any until right now, lol.  
I feel like this is a good point for me to step in. I read your post and all the "best" post above this, hoping that I had something to add. Believe me, there are a lot of great answers up there! But the OP of this chain falls in line with the way I work. I am completely communally taught: just my closest friends, a text based display, and I. I leave that on a line of its own, because I can't stress how different it was to learn on your own in the 80's when the internet hadn't even come to your town yet. All we had we're manuals built into a language editor which a friend managed to drag over from a college friend of theirs and plenty of night hours when your parents thought you were playing video games (I mean, sometimes...). I've had a career of over 20 years without a degree. I've led teams at university centers, small and large startups, small and large companies. I currently work at IBM after working for Red Hat. I've learned a fair amount of electronics, know most network stacks, built IoT platforms, designed protocols, lead a video game studio as a developer and platform architect, taught others, and so on. All of this to say, what both of you are realizing becomes more true the longer you go. I grind through most of my day arranging work, helping other programmers, and making sure teams are on track. I know that those blissful hours of coding by myself are waiting for me, waiting for all the other stuff to clear up. When that time comes and the mood coincides I do my best work; but I've learned not to sweat it if the zone is not there. I do more work in that cone of focus than I could do in a week or two of persistence - I've logged and measured it. So here's a few things to help you survive along the way to being a principle:  The more you move towards truly architecting something interesting and lasting, the less you come across it through intentional focus Let your mind slide, ponder new ideas, stop focusing on gaining a particular skill for whatever reason Build things without knowing how: this is the kernel of knowledge If you want to understand how to program, stop trying to build anything worth showing off In the end, it's often the fun one offs to fix a tooling gap that end up being the thing that takes off Enjoy the moment, don't sweat the deadlines, put your heart into the quality of the thing your building as if everything was a diamond to be polished   
As a self-taught dev of several years, here's how I'd first define a normal code block (I know, oof lol) To me, a code block would usually be a new "feature" that has already been specified in documentation and approved by concerned parties, in a section of codebase that's clearly defined, to accept a given type of expected input or process at some defined time, and outputs or does something that meets x requirements. I usually have some experience or have run tests on all concerned objects in the environment so that I feel I understand what pieces are at play and how to tie them together and accomplish the goal. In reality this is very rarely true when I begin coding for work, at least one of these things might not happen but maximizing that count is important. But when the stars align and all of those prereqs are met?! I still write buggy code. Programming in most contexts is messy, and I agree that regimented coding sessions are great for learning but they aren't great without a lot of other variables controlling and supporting the regimen in a larger team. If you think being a developer is what you want to do, here are some thoughts about my career so far.  I love it. But it isn't for everyone. I sometimes use the metaphor of a perpetual open-book math/physics/science test. Word problems only. But finding the perfect algorithm or framework late at night to solve the problem or save the deadline? BLISS! Rebuilding the wheel because you couldn't put two and two together? Socially reserved pride nonetheless. It stresses me out. Misunderstanding new systems, codebases, concepts, requirements, etc can be very rough. But to some degree it's 100% what I signed up for. We all have to continually learn and evolve, regardless if we feel like it. Luckily I've always sorta been that way, but it's taken me years to learn how to learn how to code and I'm still working on it. Some days, weeks, months, it feels like I accomplish nothing. In my experience there are underlying problems, but sometimes I'm just in a rut. I've gotten out of those by walking away for a bit and in extreme cases reimplementing in a new language or environment. And there were some that just ate at me until I gave up. Some days, hours, minutes I feel powerful. For me, it's suddenly recognizing you can competently do something you never thought to do to begin with, and it's objectively the bee's knees. A mix of "wtf I can't believe that worked" and "what would Einstein do" and "oh yes, here it is in the documentation."  You probably didn't just learn how to learn, you probably just found the right recipe to learn coding, but that's a sincerely underrated achievement. Fantastic job!  
For what it's worth, I think your session timing is good.  You have to use what works to stay motivated and disciplined.  I time myself and keep a log every day too, because I find that if I don't, I start slacking and at the end of the week I haven't accomplished as much.  
Hey congrats. I started about the same time as u but I only really understand html and css. Javascript is still a bit of a misery to me pfft  
Same. I went to Freecodecamp to learn CSS, HTML. When I go to JS, I was too confused and not one concept I managed to understand.  
I had the same experience. Nothing about JS was clicking for me when I first started using Freecodecamp, so I decided to try other resources. I highly recommend Colt Steele's JS course on Udemy, he's great at breaking down key concepts into bite-sized chunks. I also suggest Codecademy (great for visual learners) and Angela Yu's courses. Honestly, these resources helped me understand JS better than FCC. I still use Freecodecamp (I just finished the "Basic JavaScript" section, finally!), but, for me, it doesn't work as a solo resource.  
Did you track somewhere, how much time you spent for tracking your activities? üòÇüôà  
Smh. I should have. If I had really guess. Oh god maybe 10 hours? Jeez  
tl;dr anyone ?  
OP has spent 100 days reading tutorials online  
GG... Imagine if 100 days on udemy  
Retrain yourself to code in C. You learned how to write algorithms in the form of code, but that will only get you so far. You need to get a better understanding of computer science to set yourself apart from your peers. That is, get yourself more familiar with the hardware and how the code manipulates it. Unfortunately, JS is so abstracted from it that you might never come to understand the nuances you can put in your code that can turn it from just some algorithm to an efficient beast.  
I think you meant.. toldno1=null;  
Hey, really inspiring post. I learnt some web design during my Graphic Design BA, and have unfortunately fallen off the wagon with it a bit - learning some gamedev specific stuff, but have been thinking about relearning the web stuff. For making my own portfolio site, any game sites etc. A lot of blather, but your post, and it's general structure, is honestly really useful. I've got my own learning plans at the moment, but will definitely keep this saved for when I go back to web development code. EDIT \: May even incorporate some of how you did your learning into it  i.e. the daily summaries (That's actually really handy, especially for reflection), the limiter on other tabs where possible etc** Good luck with it all :))  
Have you looked at the Odin project at all?  
Try these system of learning >  Anki  
Good job. I also use codecademy pro. One of the best for sure. I finished a rock, scissors, paper game this week and I feel proud. I am planning a bigger project now. Good luck!  
You seem quite methodical. Taking things in small steps. That's how you pave the road to success. You will do well.  
BEAST MODE!  
I was really tempted to buy udemy courses at a time, but going through most of the reviews over there and on reddit, I sorta realized that learning is absolutely free. Mostly because I'm already a bit familiar with the basics of code (I'm a CS student) and all the bootcamps trudge through it for a long time. But I have little to no practical knowledge except for the database project I did for college. I've been trying to learn coding for a while now, audited an EdX course, (I liked it but couldn't motivate myself to complete it), now I did the Basic HTML and CSS tutorials on freecodecamp in a day (yesterday tbh). And I'm yet to apply all these knowledge by myself. I guess where I do need to focus on is 'focusing'. Your post has given me a new direction. I would like to ask though, I need some projects to work on. Do you know about any resources has projects for varying degrees of expertise? I think I would learn better if I start with a project, get stuck on it, learn what needs to be learnt for completing it, start another project and so forth... Just studying the concepts doesn't seem to be working so far.  
Great to see!  now as you get more comfortable, please realize you ought to venture out and see what you can do with some touted resources such as,   Odin Project(they have full-stack JS track) AppAcademyOpen and FreeCodeCamp  also for a mastery-based approach, www.lauchschool.com is there, it's $200 a month.  I encourage you go to with whatever is best based on your situation, but from the sources you mentioned, please keep in mind the first 3 free resources I mentioned.  LS is if you can/want to pay to get really into it in a deep approach in a guided way.  
Congrats that you have this high discipline and spent this 100 days active. I wish you the best and am glad that you found the right way right away and knew what you wanted to learn and witch languages.  Go on and you will get if you want to a Job cause the most important thing is keep learning and never stop cause you never now everything ;)  
Gonna be a dick for a second: this notion of doing something for yourself and not caring about telling others shouldn‚Äôt be a novel concept. When did we reach a point where everyone is doing things just to impress other people?  Regardless, congratulations - your hard work will pay off.  
Keep it up. Having been in your shoes, I would recommend learning data structures and algorithms and solving 100+ questions on Leetcode.  This will help you (1) internalize syntax to the point you can write code in your sleep, (2) learn fundamental data structures like maps and sets, and (3) overall become more confident in your coding ability. Goodluck.  
This has been a problem for me, I haven't heard of Leetcode until now. I'll definitely look into it. Thank you!  
Read ‚ÄúGrokking Algorithms‚Äù before you start as an introduction.  And to be completely candid, you‚Äôre gonna suck terribly at algorithms first and want to quit... but keep pushing and you‚Äôll get there. It‚Äôs worth it.  
Wow - I  love the tracking tools. I bet they gave you a sense of accomplishment. I need to jot down some goals or do something similar to what you have here.  
[deleted]  
Interesting approach. You're super thorough, a bit too much for me but that's in no way a criticism just an observation on different strokes for different folks :) My question is: what exactly have you been building? I think your post and approach might be more insightful and inspirational if you share some of the stuff you've been building, otherwise it may just look like another 'huge list of tutorials/sites/suggestions that worked for person X' Thanks for sharing. Always great to see how others are learning.  
I'll update this with a project I've made. Right now I'm just copying other peoples work, or building components and design elements just to see if I can, but no full applications that I can claim as my own. I had some hesitation to posting this at all, because really I had nothing of my own to show for it.  
Looks like you'll be switching to projects soon for phase 3. I'd say I'm about 2 months into 'phase 3' myself and it's been a hell of a ride designing stuff from nothing to a working app. I've learned more doing this than following tutorials and making small programs. I think you'll learn a lot too.  
So as someone literally just about to begin learning (python, JavaScript) what are the 3 most important things overall in your experience? What would you have done differently?  
I've been programming for over 25 years. All these courses and structured learning setups seem cool if they work for you. If the thought of sitting there grinding checkboxes isn't appealing, and you have something you want to build, go old school and just start building it. Plug "How to x" into Google, where x can be something like "set up nodejs" or "change a div on a page using javascript". Use whatever library or tool gets you the result you want. Be ready to scrap an idea and start over again. Never throw away code that leads to a dead end. If you're tenacious and have a vision e.g. make a game, build a cool website; you'll have something to show for your learning sessions, and have marketable job skills that you can show upon request.  
Seems like you have been learning a lot, im also learning myself. Got the basics down of Javascript and ES6 and now doing React and Redux. Have you built anything with what you have learned? I myself did lots of courses and when i was given a project to do, i had a hard fkn time knowing where to start. Either way it took me a month but holy shit does it ever shake your reality in regards to how much you know, i learned a lot, got more confident but still feel i lack confidence. But hey i learnt something i now took with me to React.  
That is what I would like to be doing, but instead it's been almost fifty days since I ordered my computer parts.  The last two times I spoke to them they said my parts would be sent soon. Instead I just got an email saying that my refund payment will be processed in 3-5 business days. I've been on hold for forty minutes as of right now waiting on customer service. Forty six days, four (it's going to be at least five total) phone calls, an hour drive to the nearest city, and absolutely nothing to show for it. I'm going to find somewhere to write out the story coherently if this doesn't end soon.  
50 days?? Not trying to be a jerk, but I literally built my new machine over the weekend, and I ordered the parts last Monday. All that's to say idk where you ordered your parts from, but best buy, b and h, and newegg got me everything I needed in 4 days or less.  
It's a long story.  The short of it is that I'm in Canada and Newegg sent parts from California. They made it up here fine, but UPS doesn't drop off at rural locations. Instead they held it in a nearby city, and sent me an email saying they were trying to contact me ‚Äìliars. I finally got in touch with them, and ended up driving to go pick up my packages ‚Äìthey weren't where I was told they were. UPS then sent my packages back to California. It went to the wrong factory, so it just sat in the corner for three weeks. I have no clue what is going on now, because three hours is the max I am willing to wait on hold for customer support.  
That's horrendous. I'm really sorry. I never realized the priviledge I have just by living in the US. Hopefully you can get it sorted out soon  
Nice! Well done! This gives me motivation, and I will follow your advice with Colts stuff. I have 7 months of c++ exp in college and just started with html today. I‚Äôm going to try to focus more! I‚Äôm notorious for having 40 tabs open.. which leads to getting off track.. but all I do is coding, it‚Äôs my favorite hobby too now. I often find myself tinkering around for 14 hrs straight with some little breaks tucked in.  
Congrats! I definitely agree that there is value in proving it to yourself before you tell others. I did something similar in October, November, and December of last year. I read somewhere about the chemical reward our brains get when we tell others of our plans, even if we haven't made progress. So as I began teaching myself, I tracked all my hours spent learning using Toggl, my preferred time tracking website. I only tracked hours where I was actually coding or focusing deeply on understanding documentation -- YouTube, reading reddit posts etc didn't count. A successful "day" of coding was not measured by what I made per se but instead measured by the lead measure of how many hours I put in. I woke up before work to do 1 - 1.5 hours of work. I'd also work in the evenings.  Once I reached 30 hours, I told my wife -- since the ultimate plan would be changing careers, so I had to let her know more, and I knew she'd hold me accountable and not just pat me on the back. Once I reached 60 hours, I began researching bootcamps in my area -- and only really allowed myself to think about them at this point. I was hesitant at first but found a bootcamp that seemed like it would be a great fit for my needs and wasn't just a Trilogy certificate mill.  Once I reached 90 hours, I applied to my preferred bootcamp and got in. Only then did I inform family/friends. The huge benefit of time tracking is that it allowed me to measure the process of learning -- time spent coding -- rather than obsess over products made or not made yet. Even if a problem took longer than I wanted it to, I could feel good knowing that I "put in my hours" for that day. And now I'm in the middle of attending my bootcamp and will keep up with time tracking to motivate myself.  
I‚Äôve been learning to code for a couple of months now, but I‚Äôve been feeling like a lack of structure in my study habits has been holding me back. Feel like this post has come at a perfect time and I‚Äôll definitely be implementing some of these tactics. Thank you so much for sharing!  
If theres something I learned is that it doesnt matter how loved you are, few thing sare as detrimental to your progress as sharing your progress mid-progress (as you, my english progress and adept-ion to redundancy is not good either). Seriously, dont lie but dont share it either.  
u/zac_solo Did you consider any alternatives to self-learning? And what enticed you to begin the 100 days of coding? Also, will you be telling anyone else now that you've delved in a bit?  
[deleted]  
Can you link the article of the person who learned to code in a year?  
what was your very first tutorial? great job!!  
Honestly it was probably on Youtube and Brad Traversy. In the end I didn't enjoy his teaching style so I moved on, but that was probably my absolute first intro lecture. Besides codecademy.  
As someone who is quiet literally on day -4 of this (I have decided to start in earnest on Friday as it coincides with current project end) this post is incredibly inspiring and timely. I will absolutely be using some of your observations. Thank you for being so thorough and congrats on your progress!!  
I suggest taking theanine for focus. Theanine can be found in form as pills, or you can just take black coffee, green tea. Reducing social media as well is your main goal to focus.  On side note, have you been reading Deep Work by Cal Newport? Your actions really make me think that you have taken some good advices from that book.  Anyways, congratulations mate, sky is the limit and just keep working hard. Remember, life is work!  
Sounds like you accomplished in 100 days what took me 4 years.  I kept dipping my toes and walking back. And learning and re learning HTML and CSS, too scared to push myself to learn much JS.  I'm more prone to completely master one idea before moving onto the next and it really slowed my progress.  I didn't really  touch React until Jan of this year. I wish I had spent a lot less time on HTML and CSS.  The most traction I got was when I started studying with Colt Steele, last summer, which inspired me to drop shit tons of money on a bootcamp. But I've gotta say, having a private tutor is worth it's weight in gold.  
After reading your post I took a look at Colt Steele on Udemy.  One course costs ¬•24000 ( roughly around US$220, I guess) ((I am Japanese)). Is it really worth the money?  All the courses I have spent money for at Udemy was fun and easy at the beginning but then suddenly it became impossibly hard around DOM JavaScript, and I have to give up. I cannot seem to find good exercises like drills on basic staff.  Smart people always tell me to just go build things but I still don‚Äôt feel comfortable without practicing grammar of the language.  Any one has the same problem?  Or am I not askin the right question ? Congrats opüéä  
you should never pay the full price. they always have promos going on. here is a link to get the promos.  
Hi amazing efforts you did! Could you tell me how did you knew that you were ready for the next step of learning, like you knew part 2 was ready to be initiated. Also the bootcamp you learn from is it free?  When you started did you also watch and copy the code? Or do you tried a different approach to learn?  
Yeah I‚Äôm doing colt Steele‚Äôs web dev boot camp and I agree it is great, I tried to learn js a few years back using code academy but at one point I got stuck and never started again.  I almost finished yelp camp and I am currently doing backend things with databases and associations. He knows how to teach coding! Great to hear someone else say so, I always get excited when someone mentions his udemy course.  
I've also started my programming journey on January but I feel bad because I think I haven't gotten nowhere as far as you, although I'm not learning webdev but Python.  I was too lazy when I first started maybe because that was the first time I tried to learn something by myself, in addition to that I'm not used to read in English because it's not my mother language, nevertheless, I decided to learn only from resources in English. Some weeks later I decide that it's time to be more serious about my future (18 yo), that motivated me to be more consistent, now I can spend at most 2 hr learning without getting bored and every day I'm more interested in programming.  
 YouTube  ‚Ä¢ Avoid at all costs, honestly.  Thank you. YouTube sucks for beginners when you're forced to type along before portions get scrolled out of view and then skip around hoping to find the portion of relevant audio that you missed.  It also sucks for those who are intermediate and up who know what they're looking for who have to essentially binary search the timeline of a video to find the relevant 5 seconds. New learners should save themselves the trouble and stick to material that's in the same format as the code with which they'll be interacting with: text.  
Man I just respect that you told no one  
Congratulations. It's a great field. Hope you find a great job/start a successful business/get a degree, or whatever you fancy with computers.  
well done ... disciplined approach. by now you may have a bunch of ideas for projects that accomplish something of value or meaning to you. don't wait until you have "learned enough." start a project, start faking it, dig in, and start cursing at impenetrable library docs. you are ready!  
Motivational and well thought out. Much appreciation for this and congrats on not spending the last 100 days deep in Netflix like the vast majority  
Nice I'm also following same approach. decide,learn,execute  
This is mad motivating!! Thank you for the reminder that we‚Äôre not alone in this journey. Congrats  
Wow good for you dude! This in addition was exponentially beneficial!!!  
woah thats some great motivation you got! my parents think im smart for coding but honestly im so lost! i take an ap course and let me tell you i currently have an F because i dont understand a thing. but you gave me some hope to continue trying and motivating to finish my assignments  
I may have missed it, but what is your purpose for learning?  How old are you?  
Man congrats for this, but it is a bit overwhelming for me haha, I prefer doing random and slowly. 100 days for me was to only understand algorithm and c++(basic) and more 100 days for object oriented, probably I will need more 100 for that lol. I still don't have idea how to make "apps", I just know how to do basic "programs" you know what I mean. Like cout  << "hello world" ; and etc.  
Inspirational!  
Good job, and good luck to you. You have a limitless journey ahead of yourself, be careful not to burn yourself out.  
This is truly inspiring, I‚Äôm going through a really tough time and have lost all my focus and ambition. Turns out I have also been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and I‚Äôve probably had this most my life with a crisis in my life really sending me to the pits lately. But I‚Äôve been given anti-depressants and I need a system to help me get back on track and this looks like it might be it. Anyways thanks again!  
Are you using Git/Github? I‚Äôd love to see some of your code over 100 days.  
I tried learning Python through CA during downtime in grad school but I kept alternating between "wow this is cool and fun" to "this is mildly confusing and makes me wanna throw my laptop across the room." It takes a special kinda person...  
I like to say "knowledge + practice = mastery". Your phases 1 and 2 correspond nicely to that. Both are needed to truly attain mastery  
Out of curiosity, when you were researching which courses to take, did you ever look into Zero to Mastery by Andrei Neagoie? He has a bunch of web programs like bootcamps on Udemy.  
Thanks for this write-up, man. I love stories like this, where someone describes their journey.  
Awesome post and effort OP!  
How did you decide that you want to pursue web dev? I‚Äôm kinda stuck here as to what I should pursue  
wow that's amazing, i'm really impressed for all  your hard work and effort! keep going man!  
This was the inspiration I needed. Thank you for sharing!  
I'm learning Android application development for the first time as well (no experience with OOP, just basics of C) and to those who want to learn how to, Udacity has a great course to begin with (if you don't know basic Java or XML, there is a separate course for that, ~25 hours long).  
Great post! Really motivated me to hit my study goals tomorrow.  In all seriousness, I‚Äôm happy for you! Keep up the good work and keep studying! Quick question, if you were to start over.  Would you start the same way? Im asking because I‚Äôm doing CS50 and it feels like it‚Äôs hard as hell. Thanks  
Another amazing resource for learning i have found is TeamTreehouse.. The tutorials and videos were clearer and easier to understand than any site or course I have previously visited, especially for javascript, which is what I mainly use it for. and my brain has a lot of trouble understanding some of these concepts, so it may be more beneficial to people similar to me who originally thought they just "can't do it" You can either simply  go to www.teamtreehouse.com or if you would like to support me with a referral I'd greatly appreciate that too.  Here is my link ‚Äã Good luck on your learning journey.  And thanks to the OP for sharing your experience. I find stories like this inspiring.  
When you are done with each project, get an experienced programmer to do a code review. You can learn as much from a code review as you learn doing the project. On top of that, a code review will bring the project closer to something you can submit as part of a resume or application. Ask your reviewer to consider your comments as well.  
I‚Äôm saving this post to come back to when my spring semester ends. I‚Äôm currently Full time student, working full time. I don‚Äôt think I can squeeze in additional time to study for something brand new. I need personal time to detach from these things and adding coding will fry me.  This all sounds like great steps. I‚Äôve been hearing more and more people stating the urgency to learn coding.  I feel like those of us that grew up with computers, aol days, etc...thats our extent with technology. Not learning to code will possibly feel a generation behind. Kind of how like people born in the 70s, they‚Äôre a hit or miss with technology. They only know enough to get by with their everyday needs.  Learning to code, I feel will put us ahead of the curve for when the world embraces technology fully. After what‚Äôs been happening lately; I‚Äôm pretty sure some companies will realize their lack of computer technology.  
Lots of good methods and approaches here. Thanks for sharing, I need some motivation and I think I can make use of your examples to get back in gear  
What you are doing is awesome and I don't think I would have the ability to do that myself without the pressures of school. Kudos, keep it up. Everything you have listed should get you most of the way there. (possibly all the way there if you are not looking for a job in the field, I don't believe you mentioned if you set out with a goal in mind.) As an aside if you are looking for a job there are a handful of things that are more conceptual in nature that can help.  Data Structures Algorithms (Efficiency and best practices) Design Patterns Software Engineering Teamwork Methodology  Data Structures - This helps understand how information is being dealt with. If you can understand how and why the information is being stored in a certain way it can help with knowing the best way to store data for certain methods of sorting and searching. Most languages deal with this under the hood, but there is always an off chance that one compiler can handle something in a different way then you're used to and understanding that brings you a step closer to fixing a mystery problem. Algorithms - You're already on your way when it comes to this one it seems, but learning more about algorithms and efficiency can put you in a position where you can look at a bit of code and understand why some bits of a website are working really slowly. Again if you're dealing with only higher level code you might not come across these problems too often, but as you become more experienced. Design Patterns - This mostly expands on the ideas of inheritance and polymorphism in object oriented languages. The idea here is mostly that people have already found out very efficient ways of dealing with common programming problem. These methods attempt to make larger projects more manageable, breaking down everything into smaller parts and minimizing dependency. Software Engineering - Short and sweet is understanding the process of building software. When beginning a project, you need to understand what the project will be about. Not only that, but there will be things you'll have to know to ask. For example if you're building something that interacts with other systems you need to know what the function of those are and how secure everything needs to be etc. Methodology - Different companies and different projects require different approaches. If something needs to be as secure and reliable as possible you'd most likely adopt a Waterfall process. While if you were looking to be able to adapt to changes  in design requirements you'd probably use an agile process. If you're interested in knowing more about any of these things feel free to reach out, I can provide resources for most of these topics. I find that understanding these areas are the main difference between a developer with and without a degree. You by no means need to know these to get a job, but they help you understand a bit of a bigger picture.  
Thats amazing man ! Congrats on the hard work !  
I'm learning programming and I've found its better than codecademy tbh. I'm watching a 6 hour tutorial on the basics (functions, loops, etc) and it makes way more sense when a person teaches it. The only issue is that there aren't too many exercises and I tend to give up on them too quickly when there are.  
As someone who has been coding for 27 years, congrats on the excellent start. Having been around the block a few dozen times and currently working with about 80% react 20% ML, I think you took a solid path that can lead to a professional career very quickly.  If you want to turbocharge your progress even more, you can try picking up my "secret weapon" stack. It consists of Kea JS, Ramda, and Material UI. Kea handles the state management (based on redux and you can still use the redux devtools) in a much more elegant and scalable way than vanilla redux. Ramda gives you an amazing set of functional programming tools for data manipulation. Material UI gives you a super solid theming and styling core and also have a great set of pre-built react components that solve 90% of your day to day UI problems.  If you become adept at these three tools your progress will leave other developers in the dust. I average a well documented 10-15x the productivity of other developers building the same applications with a much lower bug and regression rate. Part of that is experience but a big chunk is the toolset.  If you add in AWS Amplify you can tackle full stack projects at silly speeds.  Feel free to PM me any questions about the above if you need more direction.  
If you post, op, is any indication of your passion and commitment to programming, you will become - what we in the industry call - a rockstar.  
This is amazing!  I have just started learning to code too, so this is such  a good framework for me to work with. Thank you for sharing!  
Might be a dumb question but do you write notes as you watch those videos? Complete noob here lol  
This is super cool! I felt compelled to leave a comment so I could find the thread again for personal reference lol  
Wow man congrats on your progress and continued success I am sure. This is something I‚Äôve been wanting to jump into but it just seems so overwhelming. So thanks for the motivation!  
Wow! That is some excellent record keeping and discipline and all around dedicated efforts! üëèüèºI was definitely motivated by this. Thanks for that. I‚Äôm just starting from zero. It‚Äôs literally a new language. For one reason or another nothing shows on the ‚Äúphase 1 notes‚Äù attachment ü§î  
I love this.  
Learning aside, I really admire your systematic thinking when you have your processes noted so clearly. Keep up the good work man  
Great job.  
I'm not a veteran by any means, but I want to share my experience with "outdated code": While learning online, I had a feeling that I should be as updated as possible in everything. I've avoided some real quality content because "damn, thats old syntax, must be just old and worthless now". Internet content will focus on the most modern ways to solve problems, as if the other ways are useless and dead. Jumping to the present, I got a job and now I see that those trendy technologies are pretty cool, but they are definitely not the only way to go. Good "outdated" content is really worth It to understand a lot and beign able to learn things faster afterwards, since almost every new thing is made to address something from the past. Other thing with trendy technologies is that we often skip the part where we should understand why and when to use certain technology (sql vs nosql for example), which is such a great learning opportunity too.  
excellent and motivational post, your living the dream. hopefully i can turn this motivation into determination  
This is awesome! Nice work, so far. I've been wanting to tinker with Arduino coding a bit. A nice bit of inspiration to get a little nudge down that path.  
I have 3+ years of experience and have collected good resources to learn, ping me if you need help of any kind and this applies to all of you.  
Congratulations and keep coding. Not many people have such pragmatic approach to learning, and usually they have it even less when it comes to coding because all the "Learn to code for 7 days" courses. I think that beside effective time spent learning there is also one thing that you didn't state and its crucial:   It's consistency. 1 hour a day is much more than 10 hours every Sunday. When it comes to materials, in my opinion, udemy courses if properly picked can be great boost to get started, but won't give you comprehensive knowledge, that's what the books are for. (You Don't Know JS for example, you can read it online for free. One more resource that I would recommend you is https://fullstackopen.com/en/  It's completely free course about web development provided by university of Helsinki.   Beside that, I would strongly recommend Harvards CS50 which starts with C and ends with Python and JS but teaches you universal computational thinking. Good luck !  
Thanks the for this advice. I said i was gonna code andrecieved so much positive feedback that i barely did any coding  
Congratulations! I got laid off due to Covid-19 and after reading your post, I'm really inspired to start my journey. So thank you for sharing your experience. I had two questions, what do you think of teamtreehouse and do you think their javascript track something you would recommend. Second, were you working a fulltime job while doing this?  
That‚Äôs a long read but thanks for writing it. I‚Äôve been learning swift, you really just need to do it every day and by do it I mean actually use the language not just study it. I‚Äôm starting from the same point as you but without such a focussed strategy. You‚Äôve inspired me to put a better plan together so thanks for that.  
This is great, but I can't use the option of completely removing all of my distractions. It's not that I don't want to, it's that it might not be beneficial. I often come up online just to see what my friends from Uni are doing on FB - I'm somewhat of a social-introverted guy, hearing nothing from anyone for quite a lot of days seems... weird to me. I just post some jokes or programming related there and then leave, because I like sharing my thoughts with people. I use reddit to see some tech stuff is going on in the sub reddits, use linkedin to see what people in the industry are doing. Even now I'm more social on github, opening issues, writing comments, making contributions, I can't just focus on a single thing in a week. A lot of people talk to me and message me every 2-3 days, I just can't move away from phone.   Instead I've grown myself mentally about when to and where to put my time it. It's not distraction for me anymore, I use my time where I think I would see some benefit. If I do find myself distracting with something, it's often personal - I might feel lazy, or impatient, or just something personal going on in my head.    I guess this is my personal view. It's not bad, but instead of "internet is a distraction", I think more about what parts are a distraction, and the time I am using, is it even constructive?  
The work within fear is very insightful. Thanks!, first time intern right now , living constant in fear  
I have such bad imposter syndrome.... this is a great post. Always feeling not good enough like I‚Äôm about to be found out.  
I know. I needed to hear this.  
I am not sure I entirely understand what he means by that  
That feeling you get when you take on a project you don't fully understand, when you hit a wall and you don't think you'll be able to figure it out, that uncertainty that you are cut out to even be a programmer at all, that fear. If you're not constantly in that feeling then you aren't growing and learning.  
Being challenged by your work and being afraid of it are different things.  
I would argue that the difference is purely scalar, that they're two points on the same spectrum. When something is merely challenging you can see success on the horizon. When you hit deep levels of despair it's because you need to carve out a lot of understanding before you can believe you'll be able to succeed.  
\screams furiously while typing and looking in the eye an equally screaming coworker**  
Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it. That's what it is to become a software developer.  
Good to know, but realistically- how can someone devote 6-12 months learning one thing? These days to become even just a front end dev you need: some knowledge of the back end, usually a web framework.  html  css javascript whatever front end library is cool these days Database query languages like SQL/ Mongo testing and testing frameworks  some deployment these days something like docker and kubernetes You're looking at at least 3 years of learning, and this isn't even for a back end or full stack dev.  As for me, I graduated from a part time bootcamp at the end of 2019. Learned Ruby, Rails, Js, React/ Redux, html, a little css, and a little SQL. I hit interviewing and had never even heard of big O. Now almost a year later, l have had around 5 interviews progress to second round and have not made it farther. I've tried to fill in the gaps. I agree spreading yourself too thin isn't smart, but someone in my position cannot spend a year on javascript alone.  
[deleted]  
That's the thing, I'll work for pocket lint, but I'm no superstar. Guess I'll just go broke and die.  
don't give up. You don't have to learn everything.  
Thanks, and I'm not giving up. Just don't see how I can succeed.  
Not to be blunt, but with that attitude you probably will. Relax. We believe in you!  
[deleted]  
NYC baby, if you can make it here, you still probably can't make it in the bay area.  You?  
Could you elaborate on "charisma is king"? If your friend got the interview for a job with "ridiculous" requirements it probably means that they fulfilled atleast most of the requirements, right?  
I think it means if you‚Äôre a likable person with a good ambitious attitude and willing to learn, you can get into positions even if you don‚Äôt tick every box the HR person put.  
Anyone that ticks every box is overqualified.  
6-12 months on one STACK. Choose a stack and master it. A stack may have 1 language, 3-5 libraries, and 2-3 different backend technologies you have to master, but you learn them in turn, as you build things. So really, that's 6-12 months of building things with your chosen stack.  
But be ready to bail on that stack when it becomes a liability. A friend of mine re-entered the job market after 20 years of Classic ASP. Slim pickin‚Äôs, there.  
Understood. Of course MERN is using all of the newest Open source technology and won't be the forever way of building apps. In fact, it probably won't even last 10 full years, but by that time something even better/easier/more well developed will have come along in the world of javascript stacks to make it obsolete.  Technology is always changing, so that's just part of the job. If I didn't enjoy waking up early every day to learn something new, I wouldn't be here in the first place.  
What us a Stack?  
It's a series of languages, libraries, and frameworks that all "go together". For example, in the world of Javascript, React is your front end library/framework, NodeJS is the backend tool, with express, Gatsby or Next as libraries that assist that. Your NoSQL database is MongoDB which works well with Node and Express. and So on. There's the MERN stack (Mongo, Esxpress, React, and Nodejs) the MEAN stack (Angular instead of react), the LAMP stack (I forget what it stands for but PHP and MySQL are the M and P) and so so so many others - stacks involving C# and .NET core, other .NET stacks, and even architectures involving use of extensive AWS resources. There are stacks involving Django or Flask (Python based backends) as well. There are too many to know. The key is to get your base of understanding - know HTML, CSS, and JS, learn how to use a language well, and then choose a stack. Explore a lot, watch tutorials, really think about it.  
Ohhhh okok I got the rough idea what it is, thanks for taking your time to explain it to me man. I really appreciate it :)  
LAMP => Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP. I wanted to say Laravel so badly that I needed to go look.  
A collection of languages and frameworks that tend to be used together to accomplish common tasks, like making a frontend to a website with React and Redux.  
Thanks very much  :)  
I actually agree with you on this.  'One thing' doesn't necessarily mean only CSS or only HTML. I don't think a junior dev will get anywhere, to be honest. Rather, 'one thing' is only Flask or only React. Not Flask and React ‚Äì AND Django. I guess in a sense, one thing means project level focus. But then again, it depends on your prior experience and eventual goal.  For instance, if one's never heard of HTML, they're better off spending a month in that. Then CSS next.  Then maybe a little intro to SQL. Before jumping into Flask/Django.  So technically, the first few months will be spent on basic, no-framework-esque learning. But only after that can the person start going into Frameworks. I learned Django when it was hot. And I can't tell you the number of other shiny frameworks that came out that many switched to. And the eventual outcome was even more confusion and frustration. Learning is incredibly hard! The takeaway for learners is to focus on things that collectively make sense instead of chasing after latest framework out there. It may give you a temporarily thrill but thrills don't last. Let me know if this makes sense.  
On the other side there are many professions where a degree is a hard requirement. No one is going to become a lawyer, accountant or doctor by doing a bootcamp and some online courses, not even after 5 years of doing that. The fact that you can become a software engineer without ever going to school or from a completely different background is amazing to me. It's a very good thing. Yea it sucks that getting hired is hard, but there's not much to be done about it, it's supply and demand.  I don't think it's that weird to spend a lot of time learning one thing either. I also started with sort of a bootcamp and while it certainly helped me learn the basics of Java, JS, HTML and CSS I'm still learning a ton about JS even after working with it for 2 years. I just now started learning React. Even colleagues that have been programming professionally for 10 years still have areas of their expertise that they haven't even touched yet. There's a whole world out there of stuff to learn.  
I agree with you, it is amazing, it's one of the many reasons why this field is amazing. That's why it's so hard to be on the outside looking in for so long.  
Agreed. I think spending 6-12 months on one technology is a bit excessive if you're trying to get hired. Though, I can see it being useful if it means "one tech stack."  
It doesn‚Äôt have to be one technology, but it should be similar and related to what you‚Äôre learning. There‚Äôs no problem learning some basic HTML, doing a couple css tutorials and then moving on to JavaScript all in the same year, because they‚Äôre all related technologies. You‚Äôd probably have more trouble learning if you only spent a couple weeks doing web stuff, switched to game dev, decided to learn python and then decided to switch back to web dev. And by the time you switched back you‚Äôd have forgotten some fundamentals about web dev.  It‚Äôs important to build a solid foundation before moving on. Of course, if you‚Äôre starting to learn something and realize it‚Äôs not for you, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with switching to something you might enjoy more.  
Develop a portfolio of open source projects that you can show off to an interviewer. Do this for the technologies you are trying to be hired for.  If you walk into an interview with something that looks polished and has good code behind it, that will make you stand out. It doesn't have to be perfect, just something so the boss will know what your skills are.  Hiring people is scary. If you make a bad hire, you eventually have to fire someone, and you end up wasting a lot of time and resources in the process. Anything you can do to make the interviewer comfortable that you can do the job will add to your chances of getting it.  Can you do the job (competence)? Are you motivated to do the job (passion?)? Will you drive your co-workers crazy (culture)?   
 You're looking at at least 3 years of learning, and this isn't even for a back end or full stack dev.   It doesn't necessarily need to take 3 years... but to be fair, you're talking about getting into a fairly high-paying career with this experience. It shouldn't be too surprising that it takes months or years of practice. As others have mentioned, many people go through an entire 3-4 year degree program to get a junior-level job in the field.  
A saying comes to mind that is often misquoted where the complete quote is as follows, ‚ÄúA jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.‚Äù  
You're talking about the modern version that softens the blow. Wikipedia  In modern times, the phrase with the "master of none" element is sometimes expanded into a less-unflattering couplet by adding a second line: "though oftentimes better than master of one" (or variants thereof), with the writer typically saying that such a couplet is the "original" version with the second line having been dropped, although there are no known instances of this second line dated to before the twenty-first century.   
Big O notation is about optimization, unless you're going into real study of the subject, everything else will focus on deploy and ship. However, if you put 6 months into learning a language that is going to come with an intense amount of carry over to other languages. Java, JS, C, C++, C#, Python, etc etc etc. All have so much carry over because they all use similar concepts in mostly similar ways. There's a ton of jokes about developers copy/pasting from stack overflow etc. Its all too true, but it's mostly because it's about the knowledge that something exists. If you study oop languages, you'll learn about boiler plating and interfaces, so when you get to a task in a new oop language you'll say ah, I should search for the documentation on interfaces within this language. You may end up at a stack overflow for your exact problem/implementation. When you've spent a lot of time learning the ins and outs of one language, you can easily find the ins and outs of the others.  But at the same time, it also depends on how you study, if you study javascript for 6 months, but you study it in a vacuum, you've missed out on time you could've spent getting an apache server working and setting up a small website and and connecting with mongodb, etc etc. If you're working within a stack, you want to learn the stack not every individual part and then put it together. Its sort of like school, you didn't learn only math for a year then history, then science, you learn them all at once. That's just my take on it I guess though. As for the whole you have to learn everything to get a job, if you are competent enough in most aspects, you can learn while on the job. I had only worked with C# a tiny bit before getting hired on as a junior full stack on an ASP.NET webapp. But I knew enough of other languages that I only took a couple of weeks to get used to syntax and basically was rolling again. it also depends where you get interviewed, startups can be more lenient, etc.  
I agree about learning through doing projects at stack level. I spent ages learning Python as my first language, mostly because I was learning new concepts that were alien to me. Python was just the way I was exploring them, (OOP, algorithms, etc.).  I broke this tutorial hell by working on a Django app that forced me to learn much more to meet my goals; front end/js, DBs, deployment and CI, testing, Git branching... the list goes on. And I learned by f**king up continually!  But recently I‚Äôve started learning JS much deeper and it‚Äôs surprising easy as I get the conceptual stuff. Similarly I‚Äôm dabbling in SICP out of interest and again there is transferable knowledge. I think noobs sometimes think they can master something in an unreasonable timeframe. Boot camps exploit this belief way too much.  
Not to be unrealistic, but most of this you can pickup in a few weeks on freecodecamp.org. The hardest part of being a frontend dev is to have actual understanding of algorithms and data structures. The rest would be easy once your logic is solid.  
HTML and CSS are effectively in the same bucket of things in terms of learning how to make a webpage.  If you already have a language behind you javascript is probably in the same bucket as your front end tooling.  
To anyone reading this post. This is some of the best advise you‚Äôre going to get.  Read it. Bookmark it. Read it again in a couple of months and then in a couple of years. This is evergreen wisdom.  
That means a lot. Thanks üôè  
fosho fosho  
Great advice!  Alot of things sure hit home.  I will say that I'm now using Anki for Spaced Repetition.  In my job as a SysAdmin I often do tasks only once every few years.   Several times I've forgotten or didn't write it down and spent weeks unraveling it.  
Documentation: everyone needs it, no one makes it.  
Nearly everything I learn is meticulously documented in OneNote.  I already have dozens of pages covering topics such as SQL, Scala, Java, Kafka, Spark, Bash and so on.  Indeed highly recommended. Helps sooo much to look up things after a few weeks.  
Thanks man, I really needed this today. Especially the fear part and the consistency part. Often times I've let myself slip into "last minute cram" mode for 2 hours and then get frustrated and intimidated when I don't have it figured out right away. And then that spirals into "Well I tried my best for 2 hours just to get this small thing almost figured out, so I must be really dumb," and then I have to fight more avoidance and procrastinating to get back into it. I think I'll just take it small chunks at a time, and maybe try to frame that nervous feeling into excitement and challenge instead of fear. Thank you for that friend :)  
I know the stress and frustration. Small winnable chunks at a time is the way.  
I see it as a language. What would you do if you wanted to seriously learn say Spanish. Studying should go along immersion. Movies books videogames. Having a single conversation every X time doesn't cut it. You gotta speak it, listen to it, exercise it. If you think just understanding it's basics just will make it work, it's like studying the top 1000 most used words and thinking that because you got that list memorized you now understand Spanish.  
Is this the hungary folk dancing you were talking about? https://www.youtube.com/user/AlgoRythmics  
haha. yes!

It might take some time to learn what you like most. If you‚Äôre more into backend or cli stuff, it might worth it to take a look at Go. I‚Äôve switched around between a few languages before finally switching to it for most of my projects. I primarily do CLI and networking stuff, with the occasional web project thrown in. I like the infrastructure and architectural part of programming and systems administration, so I build tools to support connecting things together.  You also don‚Äôt need to know one thing all too deeply; I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs nice to have a wide range of knowledge that you can later supplement with domain specific stuff that you can learn as you go. So it‚Äôs important to know how networking works is important, but knowing how Go‚Äôs net library works is much less important because you can always look it up and things do change over time, so it‚Äôs a good idea to look at the docs regularly.

 As you learn and experiment, pay attention to the kinds of tutorials that work for you. Many will not work. That‚Äôs fine. In fact, that‚Äôs exactly how experiments work until you find a solution.   After you strike gold, stick to it, consume it voraciously and then find similar tutorials like that to continue rapid growth.  This is me. I've determined that the best tutorials for me come from Brad Traversy, I don't know why but I love his style. I'm going to stick with his tutorials basically forever until I exhaust his supply. Since he uses so much MERN stack, it also plays into the last point:  Master One Thing   ...   Pick one thing.   Stick with it for a few months ‚Äì ideally 6 to 12 months before you move to something else.  I've committed to learning and mastering the MERN stack. There are so many good resources to learning it, it's up and coming, and you can basically build anything with it. I'm not even going to touch Django until I've built 6-10 apps with MERN, and I think that will help me to make progress way faster than if I just splattered my attention on every stack known to man. Ben Awad has a great video about this as well, and reiterates that with React, Gatsby, and Next, you can basically build anything you'd need to have a career. So get started.  
This is excellent! People don't talk about this form of mastery as much as they should but this is the ultimate approach. For instance, I have debugged Vue code only after only a few minutes of skimming through a basic hello world tutorial.  I still can't write any code in Vue to save my life. But I know that the mental models from mastering Flask and Django served me well. You master one and when you get to another, you compare the new space to existing domain knowledge, identify the difference and map it that way.  So Django = Flask + X; React = Flask + Y;  Keep going!  
 You‚Äôll meet a**holes  I used to go on stack exchange to ask simple regex questions when I was working on a website. I don't know any programming. God damn, what a bunch of snooty pricks. The first response is always something along the lines of why are you asking such a simple and stupid question? It was an ordeal to get information out of them.  
Lots of great insight here. Thanks for the advice!

So glad to hear! You got this.  
This was very insightful. Thanks for sharing.  
Sure thing!  
 You‚Äôll meet a**holes  All the worst people I've encountered, which are thankfully few and far between, have been pretty evenly distributed among different career paths. I think there's some heavy confirmation bias in this field, it's not any worse than any other.  
I'll have to disagree on this one. Having spent a huge chunk of my life in engineering and also in social sciences/liberal arts, I've seen countless horror stories of how programming communities heavily block new comers.  And there are more and more stories of this. It's 2020 and frankly not a lot has improved. Are there horrible people in other fields?  Yes.  This is inevitable - in fact the higher you go, the more you meet them (I'm fine with these spread here and there). But sadly in programming you meet them way too early.  
My comment will probably get buried but I gotta say this: I've met those a**holes. I'm in that rut. I'm constantly scared. I'm about to graduate, my peers are better than me and constantly remind me how better they are and how they have opportunities just handed to them. Finding the motivation to just push through obstacles has become extremely difficult. My peers/friends won't help me, I'm all alone. I am trying to study MERN or just React and competitive programming(leetcode). I need advice, I just feel like I need advice...  
Don‚Äôt give up, use all the resources you can to learn, spend extra time with your professors, ask questions on here. Most importantly remember you‚Äôre not alone, there are many of us in your situation, and many more of us who are here to help.  
This sub is exhausting  
Agreed with each point and reddit is filled with such a***oles who'll downvote you without confirming their facts.  i've noticed a lot of people here are opinionated noobs here who aren't open to something that might be better than the tutorial written by the original maker.  
You should have seen the early days of stackoverflow or a linux community. It thickens your skin though üòâ  
Thank you  
A Few things in here that actually make sense and I relate to wow  
Definitely agree that consistency is king.  
I have a question: if I have created games with pygame, and have created a GUI with tkinter and feel like I‚Äôve got those down, do I have to spend 6 months on those modules when I could move on to Flask or a Discord Bot but still stick to python and become a journeyman and I was thinking of sticking to Python until Summer 2021 with some projects I‚Äôm thinking of, all within python but in different fields, like robots or flask  
Could you elaborate the "work within fear" point. Are referring to the "I don't know anything" or "this is all new to me" fear?  
I'm referring to both and beyond. Fear could also be:  - "I'll never get this."  - "I'll never know past this level." - "I got this job and they'll soon discover I'm a fraud!"  
In other words , imposter syndrome. Imposter syndrome is one of the toughest obstacles any and every person in this field will have to overcome.  
Yep, this is actually my next post.  People who reached out brought this up. And I keep seeing it over and over. It's tough but I'm hoping to put out something that'll help people manage it.  
u/a-gentility The first sentence under "Work within fear: not against it" says "I'll admit: this one is easier than done" when it should say "I'll admit: this one is easier said than done"  
That's what I needed to read. I'm in under graduation, and I was in that state of learn EVERYTHING. Every top rank language, the most well paid and so on until I read a post in a blog that say: "Find a language that you have fun with it". Now you advice is a combo, thx for take your time to write this.  
thank you for sharing your experience with us  your post motivated me to trying harder again  
Many people need to hear the last point  
Thanks a bunch for posting, gonna apply what I can out of this to my current learning and hopefully improve.  
I needed to read this. Thank you  
This is one of the best advice I could ever get, thanks man

Try restarting where you started previously. Just being able to make stuff happen will start to rekindle the fire. I'd lost whatever passion I had after getting laid off this year (COVID-19). It took me really digging through my head and the resident bullshit to figure out that just restarting a tutorial I'd never finished would be a solid first step. So, I did. Then I got a bunch of Udemy courses on sale, and have since been scheduling myself some time each day on four. From there, I have started to work on my website itself--not so much in code, but in what I actually want to see from it. I'm writing it out as an outline, almost as if I were writing a paper. The goal is to have a solid foundation for features, colors, etc., with which I can then properly break down the site into reusable components that I keep in a library.  That whole diatribe was not a thing I was capable of a month ago. Just walking through it with you now, in an effort to help rekindle your fire, is making me feel better about things (even though I am still laid off).  
Great post.  
Never seen better post than this!!!! Amazing man, thanks for the advice!!!!!  
Bookmarked & saved. As a college student who just started coding w/ Python, this is the advice I‚Äôve needed. Good luck to everyone, sending you all motivation when it‚Äôs needed.  
Awesome read, would like to mention that your Twitter DMs are not open atm. Would love to ask you some more questions if you could open them.  
This works for me so it may work for others but I approach it as pick up a new language I want to learn, repeat 2-3 courses on that language let‚Äôs say vue, then follow project tutorials that may use something else lime laravel or fire base or something, but get a better idea with vue, then build out a good project to follow and try to learn a lot from it. You could post those projects on your resume to showcase, this way you don‚Äôt spend a whole year learning one thing, instead you spend a month really nailing down something, then learning another things that compliments that first thing. Plus if you‚Äôre applying for jobs this will showcase you are trying to learn, then if you get the job you‚Äôre time spent there will strengthen your entire career.  
Thank you, I needed this. I was catching up on reading Automate the boring stuff, I understand what each section is teaching, but when I get down to the practical questions and project section‚ÄîI feel so small.  I think to myself, ‚ÄúDang, I barely can write up a code on how to solve for this problem.‚Äù It puts me down, but I know if I keep practicing and watching different videos, maybe, just maybe, it‚Äôll click. Don‚Äôt give up everyone, it‚Äôll click, like OP said, try different sources‚Äîsometimes books don‚Äôt convey the proper information to make all the pieces fit.  
The best CS prof I ever had showed us the Hungarian dance videos! I loved them, it was the only thing that made it click for me  
How do you recommend using spaced repetition? Code wars?  
Great advice sir üëç  
Thanks for this writeup. I'm trying to get more into coding myself, and it's nice to get some heads up for some of the difficulties ahead!  
Solid advice.  
Something my high school coding teacher told us: When you're learning something, type it all out so you get used to writing it and seeing it. You'll understand it more than if you let auto-complete and copy/paste do all the work for you. Once you know a thing or two, you can let the auto-complete do a thing or two  
I agree. Typing out builds muscle memory. Plus, during white board interviews, you'll have to write things out so it helps to truly know your stuff.

Great post, but just wanted to note that I don't think the quote cited below is particularly accurate, as programming is a fair bit more arbitrary, as you're learning to work with systems that were made arbitrarily; underlying associated skills like logical reasoning, however, aren't, but still that's pretty basic and more or less something you either have or don't-there's little that distinguishes one's ability to reason logically from another's, whereas with something like music, which seems more innate, intuitive, creative, etc. Logical reasoning itself, and symbolic thought, are intuitive too, but the syntax and structures designed for programming generally aren't. Creative talent is indeed more of a factor with music, whereas programming is more analytical.  But becoming a proficient developer is like playing an instrument. Only a tiny few are born talented.  Really anyone can program, and I don't think it's something that really requires much talent, but does require work and commitment to learning the systems and how they're supposed to work, and that can be challenging, especially since the concepts aren't always clearly explained, people tend to use overcomplicated jargon, etc (honestly I think many in CS do this intentionally, maybe to sound smart. In comparison, subjects like math and physics are really clear with having apt terminology and conceptual clarity. They don't try to make things artificially harder for people who try to do math or physics, and that's how it should be for programming and everything, but typically isn't). Anyway this is the real challenge, as your post conveys: to find resources which will communicate things comprehensively but as simply as possible. There are many resources out there that will show you what to do, but not explain what's really happening, and there are many that will seem almost encyclopedic, which can be a good thing, except many won't actually go into full detail, or will stop short on concepts, not going up or down in abstraction. Eg when I was first learning JavaScript I'd look at MDN's pages on classes, trying to figure out how exactly classes and functions were related, and it states some things very formally, but also by reading its examples, you'd realize there were many smaller details that weren't explained or even touched off on at all. I don't recall them talking about protocols much either; they didn't go into much depth there.  
Fair points. My comparison to learning to play an instrument isn't a one-to-one mapping with learning to program.  But I've heard many beginners give up even before putting adequate time because they think their brains can never be wired to code. I hear you though on the needless complexity that most tutorials have. But coming from the instructor end, it is also incredibly hard. Out of curiosity, are you a logician by training? It's interesting how you label Physics and Math as straightforward. But I've actually seen people struggle more with these than with coding.  
These lessons are invaluable for learning in general!  I am not a programmer (I'd love to learn one day) but I have used, independently, all the above in my own field of work in one way or another!  A great post with great advice, op! I saved it in an instant  
i‚Äôve been doing that since i started but thank u anyway it‚Äôs nice reading it from an expert !!‚ù§Ô∏è  
awesome read man. thanks a million  
I really needed to read this. Thank you!

I'm 34 trying learn JavaScript through grasshopper. I have an automotive mind so running through logic shouldn't be that hard to understand. But have you or anyone else use grasshopper. I forget the syntax (think that's right) any way to increase memory retention I get spatial practice to say but when I go to practice let's say a couple of boxes moving side to side I get lost what to do first and then begin. Want to change/start a career and I started on those old school I think Tandy computer that hooks to TV. So I did early version of coding before 4th but then started moving and lost it. Does just come down to confidence maybe I should started a new post sorry but any help would be helpful and appreciative damn covid lost job and a little lost  
 grasshopper  I haven't used grasshopper but I just checked it out and it looks like a nice way to warm up into the space if you're an absolute beginner.  You may have to combine Grasshopper with other tools to accelerate your learning. But all of that depends on: 1) Your personal timeline to start a new career and; 2) How much time you're willing to realistically spend learning each day. Hope this helps.  
Thank you, makes me feel better. It's thing like this which keep you ploughing on.  
Just been coding a bit and in a college class for it and can agree with the fear part. Doing programming assignments are hard cause i like build up anxiety and it was nice to know that many feel the same way  
thank you, bookmarked.  
One thing I'm struggling with is trying to picture out a function. For example, I can't understand how a for loop helps in reversing a string when it goes like this: for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++)  swap(str[i], str[n - i - 1]);   
Do you still have the links to those hungarian folk dancing videos? I'm intrigued  
What do you guys think about codecademys course on Intro to Data Science?  
Any advice for someone who struggles with major ADHD? I have been using the Pomodoro Technique, and I noticed that I only last for 10mins before my mind goes somewhere else. I started to see a therapist, but I feel like it is very difficult for me to focus for more than 10 mins. I have found the best way that suits me when it comes to learning web development, but I cannot seem to have my mind sharp. I have also been doing mediation whenever I feel I am not focused on coding or anything else in general. But I feel like mediation does not help. Or I am simply just doing it wrong.   
As a junior DEV looking for work again, I feel like I‚Äôm playing whack-a-mole with requirements. It‚Äôs maddening.  
Thanks for the wisdom. Over the last year i've tried breaking into the learning process and each time it kind of fizzled out until the last few months.  What you said about finding the right tutorials or resource. This was my biggest problem. Eventually after trying to burn through enough vague youtube tutorials and just said "ya know, fuck it." And dropped 13 dollars on udemy. Seriously a great resource I felt like such a cheap bastard for not doing it sooner. I spend more at taco bell sometimes. Just a heads up to any other beginners. Don't be scared to invest a small amount into learning if you're feeling stuck. It can be the push you need.  Once I'm done i'm gonna get another 13 dollar  course on training to get my MTA certification from Microsoft. Then it's all uphill from there. Fuck school (unless you can afford it). I think setting short term goals is a good trick too.  
So desperately needed this at this exact moment. Thanks!  
Bravo  
Thank you.  
All great points  
stackoverflow - for problem solving and where to meet a**holes.  
Not a programmer but this is amazing, thank you.  
Just started my second job as a mid level SWE building React apps. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs could be said any better than it being every bit of exciting, frustrating and intimidating. Some deep lows and soaring highs. Honestly wouldn‚Äôt wanna do anything else.  
Thank you  
Thank you, thank you, thank you thank you. I cannot say thanks enough. This will really help me not put so much pressure on myself to learn.  
Thanks for the insight! I can relate to the constant fear of messing things up and the concern over forgetting.  
Amazing post, this gave me even more motivation. I have added you on Twitter too  
I like this. Thanks!  
wow  
Thank you so much for this article. The fear is real like how I am viewed. Am I stupid for not getting it right after like wrestling it for hours or days or weeks or months or I think my eyes are going to drop out already n I wonder in my head if this is all worth it, especially I see my ex-colleagues who work for 2 hours and not even finished college and the salary is much much more than me. So thanks.  
You mentioned that we should master one thing before moving on. Is it necessary to gain professional experience (or something resembling it) before you attempt to move on?  Fairly competent in web development but I've always wanted to go down the Python & R route to better understand data, my current reasoning is that I should work, or at least intern for a Web Dev. firm before moving on to others. How do I gauge myself in this scenario? Am I at risk of losing what I've gained if I spend the next couple of months in another language?  
What a great fucking read. Thank you for this post my friend! I‚Äôd love to be a part of your initiative because some of the things you mentioned, I related to very much! So I‚Äôd definitely love to learn smarter and feel less overwhelmed. Cheers!  
Thank you so much! I do like it. It is what I need right now:)  
Normally I do not comment, but after recently starting a new job with an unfamiliar environment, I get that feeling of fear and your post validates my experience, I‚Äôll sleep a bit easier tonight thanks!  
I've been pushing to learn javascript with Google scripts.  Any idea on where to find good solid tutorials? It seems no one ever had exactly what I'm looking for.  From stackoverflow, to reddit, to YouTube.  I've managed to cobble together enough info to write some scripts, but trying to push my boundaries further.  
You mention Udacity, Coursera, etc. Is there one learning platform you would suggest or would it be best to be on a few? Thanks for your time and for your post.  
I‚Äôm doing the Chili game tutorial c++ on YouTube and I‚Äôm learning a lot. But I always feel like I‚Äôm not good or smart enough and just get discouraged sometimes. Or I want to learn but the idea of learning is greater than the learning. I feel like I know myself well enough that I know that once I hit that certain plateau of understanding then I‚Äôll be able to go on my own and create stuff that will help me get a job one day. It‚Äôs just getting to that point. Sometimes I wish I had a tutor that forced me to stay consistent for certain amounts of time :/  
Thanks it is very helpful. As a freshly diplomed software dev with a work since 3 weeks, I can totally relate. It is very hard.  
You gave me hope! I am a woman and I started to learn java on my own. Its my dream and I really want to become a developer. Sometimes I get discouraged because I feel thst I will never get to master it,no matter how much effort I put. I work full time and I still try to push myself to learn java because I want to walk down this path. Seeing how the job market doesnt want people without at least 1 year experience in coding for another company while no company wants people without work experience in coding,its very scary and doesnt help either (at least thats how it is in Europe).  Thank you for giving me hope !  
I feel like there‚Äôs one of these posts every week  
Thanks for this awesome post, Love it!  
Thank you!! This is all really good advice. As a woman, I am only more pushed to be successful and be apart of that representation.  I struggle a lot with consistency and beat myself up when I forget a lot of ‚Äúbasic‚Äù things. It‚Äôs all practice and hard work. Thank you again  
I know the feeling of forgetting the "basics" and sometimes feeling worse because others seem to be breezing through.  You got this though.  
This is a great read. For newcomers yes, but even a few years into my career so much of this is relevant. My first year in a new job was spent jumping around between different areas, to a point I didn't feel confident in any area. There are absolutely a-holes. Sometimes disguised behind a smile. I have this post saved to revisit in the future.  
Glad you found it useful even as an experienced dev :)  
Thank you very much for the advice. I'm 46 and I did Python basic for about  1 1/2 years,  and  I've been learning Django, CSS, and bootstrap for  about 2 months. These aren't joke either, especially CSS Flexbox. Once again thank you very much for the advice.  
 Since then, my approach to learning has been to learn the same thing from multiple places until I find the instructor and style that works for me.  I would reword this differently: There's no shame in googling up different explanations for the same concept. In fact, I recall a letter John Carmack wrote to a 14 year old, where he emphasized that even Carmack used different books (because back then videos online weren't a thing) in order to understand something difficult to him.  And some of you will be like "but that's John Carmack, THE John Carmack. The guy who skipped a year at school, who attended university just for the computer science courses, and finally he quit university to focus on his self-studies. He had no degree until a few years ago where they gave him a honorary degree for his achievements". Yes, that Carmack. Even that Carmack admits that sometimes needs multiple sources to understand some concepts. And now you feel kinda silly for sticking to 1-2 resources before you start jumping to conclusions about  your lacking intellect, instead of questioning the teaching method. Sources: Tweet where Carmack admits his advice, video of Carmack receiving his honorary degree after quitting university decades ago. I hate that we correlate hard work with talent so strangely. We tend to think that if you have to work hard to understand something this must mean that you're lacking in some way because the fictional talented person in your head would have gotten it right the first time. It sucks.  
Great read! Thank you very much for the tips :)  Although I agree with other users that "work on one thing" is not how my first year as a  (post degree) programmer have gone. Although on the plus side, I feel pretty happy about switching to a new tech stack at this point - although those first few weeks progress is definitely slow, I have more confidence that I'll get there now.  
Brilliant read thanks. I'm struggling massively in my job a the moment and have constant fear and anxiety.  
Breathe. Work one task at a time. Break down the bigger tasks into smaller tasks. If something doesn‚Äôt produce the expect result, pause; then consider what the likely issues are: syntax, wrong function, miscalled variable, etc. Work through each of those. If you‚Äôre stuck, take a 5-10 minute break away from that screen. Breathe. Take a walk, outside if at all possible. Make a list of other possible causes, and work through those. (We assuming you‚Äôre talking to the duck throughout.) If nothing works, move on to another task if possible and/or ask for help. This will get you through most work problems, whether they‚Äôre with writing code or managing/being managed or projects from hell.  You‚Äôll notice there‚Äôs no time in here to stop and consider how some fictional, better trained and smarter employee would be doing and how you really should be more like them. Or time to think of what the heck will happen tomorrow when you have to figure out that gnarly thing that is obviously impossible so failure is imminent.  You got that job because someone smarter than you knows you can handle this. Trust them. Trust yourself. Just keep working. It‚Äôll get better.  
I hear you. It'll get better with time. Just trust that this struggle is part of the journey and some day you'll look back with pride.  You got this!  
Thank you for this. I've been slogging at Python, Java, and god know what else for years. This year, I found to the Microsoft learning paths and not only does the Python finally click, I was able to take a test for a coding bootcamp and did much better than I thought I would. The information was in my brain, but the tutorial I found was the first to make me feel like I was able to apply what I've learning.  I want to go into Data Analysis and currently I have an internship in log management. But it is very much self guided and when I searched the internet, there was so much that I become overwhelmed. But I went back to Microsoft and realized there was a learning path for data analysis that is the continuation of the Python learning path. So that is where I'll stay because I know it works for me  
That's great! Coursera has some phenomenal courses on Data Analysis depending on if you want to stay as a quant analyst or go more into the machine learning route.  For more intro courses, I love Udacity and can't recommend it enough. Here's an intro course: https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-science--ud359  
Wow thanks. I am not a software developer but an electronics engineer forced to do software stuff(even though i like programming but programming alone is boring for me) Learning and forgetting things is something i have experienced. Also the market is really tough right now. Thanks for your valuable experiences  
Those assholes are narcissists, sociopaths or psychopaths, basically these people lack empathy which helps them easily understand numbers and go into these careers, even business leaders are almost always one too especially with inherited wealth and hooked up jobs So yeah that's another warning for people who move into fields and get promoted to management or higher where the moral less decision makers are at  
Thank you for taking the time to write this. I start my learning process tomorrow and you give great advice that I needed to hear.  
[deleted]  
Definitely one of the best posts, thank you :)  
I've bookmarked this :)  
 But I‚Äôve since learned that you‚Äôll forget anything you learn in isolated exercises because they are stored in short term memory. Neuroscience research shows that this is just how the brain works. If you don‚Äôt want to forget, test your knowledge using spaced repetitions. To do this, build projects.  Thank you for this. This was eye-opening. Now I understand why I forget so much of the stuff, despite doing the exercises meticulously.  
Thank you for the action plan. When you're lost, you just forget any of the go to steps.  
Thank you so much for sharing this!!!  
Thank you !  
This will be my Bible thank you.. Since I am a woman I will need a bit more resilience  I will get there  
You got this!  
This speaks to me. I litterally jump around trying to learn new stuff. Idk why. Ill start following your advice.  
Haha - that's awesome!  
One hard thing that I learned is: Coding is awesome as a hobby/freelancer, but the worst as a job, it seems "modern slavery" I just don't know how people accept this. At least in my country it pays so little for so much knowledge, work and stress that don't makes any sense to me.  
There sure are a**holes, but this is my fourth profession I've dived into and I have never seen a better community  
great advice.  
I would upvote you twice if I could.  
You Will Meet A**holes. You will learn how to interact better with people when you go through this experience. If someone is acting sh*t and making you feel uncomfortable, just move on and be less reactive. Sometimes you just ask a question, and instead of getting an answer, you get personal attacks like "why are you even doing this?", "who you think you are?", "the big companies couldn't solve this and you think that you can?", "big companies use this and so you should", "you shouldn't be doing this!" and so on then it really gets into a personal conversation rather than a technical one, in this case, it's better to assert that you don't want to answer to those types of questions and if those questions persists, you just move on and find other people with whom you can have a respectful conversation.  
The whole master 1 thing has been my downfall over the 7473294978584 times that I've tried to learn to program. ADD doesn't make life easy.  
Appreciated this, thank you.  
‚Äã Thanks for this honest post.  It makes being a mother a bit easier when I can offer my kids someone else's advice. :)  
 New devs tend to jump around learning a lot of things. Okay, it‚Äôs not just new devs; it‚Äôs also experienced folks. You learned React for one week. Then Django for two weeks. Laravel for three. Stop. You need to wake up and realize that the harsh truth is that you‚Äôre simply extending the time it‚Äôll take you to truly learn anything.  Felt like I got called out here. My nephew told me pretty much the same thing.  I've been studying programming since 2016 and I am still a pretty bad noob. I feel this hard. On one hand, I feel like I need to learn more to have a big CV in order to get hired. On other hand, I feel like I am not good at anything because I never specialize. Every time I am trying to deepen my knowledge, something diverts my attention, like being asked to do a job. And I botched a few so far*, my CV is totally empty on experience.  I wish I could just sit down incomunicado in an isolated location with internet, food and water, where I could spend days on a computer, just learning programming by myself and only getting out until I am the programming god I know I should be by now. It just ins't right, it has been four years, I should be a programming god by now!  *to be fair, one was shortly after my cousin died, the other my computer broke and the current one, another one I took too long (because nobody back then told me that Bootstrap and vue.js are like water and oil and assumed they didn't care any more, and in my latest failure,my employer decided to do it himself because I went incomunicado in a bit of total tunnel vision because I was too focused on learning skills I needed to do it rather than giving him constant updates.  
Oh no losing someone is tough.  It‚Äôs good to check yourself and have self realizations but don‚Äôt beat yourself too much.  I knew about focusing before but it took me years to finally accept this truth on an emotional level.  And to be honest I only started doing so after I saw research backing the need to focus.  
Folks, I want to take this opportunity to explain our Rule 2 a little bit more in depth. To be clear, we don't have an "absolutely no self-promotion" policy on this subreddit. We actually have a set of rules regarding self-promotion. While I can't comment on the quality of this resource (yet), I can say that this doesn't appear to be violating any of the rules. Additionally, we require users to be regular posters in /r/learnprogramming, not just drive-by posters. This particular user is not a drive-by poster, they have plenty of helpful (non-self-promotional) comments on /r/learnprogramming. Now, to be clear: we allow occasional self-promotion. For instance, we wouldn't allow someone to make weekly self-promo posts, even if they are a regular helpful member. But occasional self-promotion that follows the rules is allowed.  
Anything for backend developers(in springboot and sql server)?  
not at the moment, but I'd def like to make some backend challenges. If your comment gets enough upvotes I'll consider it!  
Seems I'm getting upvotes. Hope I get enough.  
looks like it! lololol  
I can just post my own projects, plenty of bugs in there to find!  
And this is about the time OP realized they may have over-committed....  
If you want any help setting up a backend one lmk.  
Can I send a DM?  
Go for it  
So what you think u/sbmsr ? This comment received the most votes.  
I‚Äôve got something in the works!  
have you heard about the Gilded Rose kata?  
 Gilded Rose kata  no I have not. I am a frontend developer who wants to learn backend. Currently going through some java and springboot tutorials  
Same, Some backend java stuff would be really useful!  
Let us know if you find something.  
This is awesome! I always wanted something to test me as if it was a real word job and I think this hits right in the target.  I'm definitely trying this one out and will look forward for more challenges!  Thank you!!  
If you are interested in frontend dev, there's a set of challenges here: https://www.devdrills.io/drills  
Honestly? The responsive design for mobile of this site I should be a challenge on its own  
Valid point, if you are talking about the table view it's going to be improved soon. I am currently working on adding a preview to user submitted code. Sorry it's not in a good state(most of the dev practice happens on the desktop so it's a bit better than the mobile experience) but I would love any constructive feedback especially around the quality of the questions as they are the only thing I have put focus on, rest were stitched together in a week to see if it's even worth putting in the time.  
My buddy, who is guiding me to some extent, said he liked your challenges.  
Oh shoot, sorry, I didn't know you're the creator of the site, please don't hate me haha The responsive design is one thing, I took a glance at the questions on the desktop and yeah it's fine there :) There are two other problems that I can see: spelling errors like [not putting space before (, writing Google and google, writing html instead of HTML etc.] and.... I can't see what I'm doing i.e. I can change the code but I don't believe there is any preview to what I'm doing. The questions themselves seem fine, at least to me :D  
I think it‚Äôs pretty good! The table view at bottom could use a scroll bar or something on mobile to show there‚Äôs more text for mobile screens.  
Noice. Looks cool!  
Check out Wilco, that's literally what it's designed for. I tried it out and used to joke to my wife that after work I'd be "going to work" for my second job, and open up Wilco. It literally feels like you started a new gig, Slack clone included. I'm still quite early in the learning phase so I decided to stop and focus on coding, but closer to when I start applying I'll definitely pick it back up to to make the transition to the real world as smooth as possible.  
 Check out Wilco  https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/22/roger-wilco/ https://www.trywilco.com/ https://app.wilco.gg/  
Not what I'm studying right now (reviving and expanding on old Python knowledge), but I love the concept and build of this simulator and will keep an eye on it and likely come back to it sometime. Seems like a cool idea.  
ty! give it a shot when you're ready and lmk what you think :)  
This looks cool. I can see how with enough time and resources, this can be scaled to accomodate differing difficulties and scopes. For instance (I will call them "Levels" for a lack of a better term), here are some possible tasks breakdowns (in the context of web development): Level 1: Simple functionality changes like changing a button, updating texts and headers, rearranging and realigning objects, color adjustments, etc. Level 2: Tasks involving changes to parts of a single webpage (basically different combinations of Level 1 per tasks per assignment). Level 3: Tasks involving changes to a single entire webpage (basically different combinations of Level 2 per tasks per assignment). Level 4: Tasks involving changes to parts of multiple different webpages (basically different combinations of Level 3 tasks per assignment). Level 5: Tasks involving changes to multiple different entire webpages (basically different combinations of Level 4 tasks per assignment). // Then the scope here changes Level 6: Tasks involving creating an entire basic webpage (the general pseudocode and framework has been provided, but everything else still needs to be made). Level 7: Tasks involving creating an entire basic webpage from the ground up from scratch. Level 8: Tasks involving not only creating an entire basic webpage from scratch but also incorporating other technologies and services to further expand its scalability, security, efficiency, and robustness. Level 9: Being given vague, arbitrary, and abstract specifications and determining which technologies and services would be most appropriate to achieve the technical and business goals of the desired product of the client (delving more into system design and architecture territory). I can definitely see how in the far future, levels 6 to 9 can be simulated using your product. Perhaps you could also incorporate different languages and frameworks as well as a online/offline team-building feature (where you can invite your friends, colleagues, or classmates to take on one of the levels given a timeline so as to simulate a collaborative working environment). Of course, you can also could also allow other products to be made other than websites and have a corresponding level scale for them. At this point, I've been rambling a lot but nevertheless, this is a cool idea and I would love to see where you take it!  
I am mostly self taught. I have found that while I can create things from scratch. It's really difficult for me to understand others code and build upon it instead. I think this is a really important skill to have, something a lot of tutorials don't teach.  
I did an intensive boot camp and I‚Äôm the opposite! If I have to start something from scratch then everything I‚Äôve ever learned becomes inaccessible by my brain.  
Understanding anothers code is hard. It's often because you don't/didn't understand all the intent and expected behaviour that went into someone else's code. I can follow my own code easily because I wrote it, I built it up from a set of requirements, I know what design decisions I took or why halfway through the project a requirement changed and why I had to shoehorn that bit of code in to make it work. Reading others code doesn't intrinsically tell you about these things, but good coders will make concessions to help others understand their code better, those guys are what we call good teammates.  
Which level where you have to be in 4 hours of meetings a day bike-shedding over the most trivial shit then the product owner says you have half the time to finish as you need. And what are the points for this story?  
Bery cool stuff.  
Will you extends this with some "meeting that could've been an email" scenarios? /s  
Plus stand ups for 45 minutes a day and sprint planning every other week for 2-3 hrs?  
oof, straight to the heart  
lololololol  
Or a PM mailing you a spreadsheet with a few two word features in the first column and the request to add some columns with user stories "but only as keywords" "just for am overview"...??? Literally happened to me today. Still have idea what he wants. Maybe he just had a stroke.  
Keep us posted  
This is a great resource. For anyone reading this, this is EXACTLY the type of work I had to do right after being hired after college. Definitely recommend using this!  
How long ago was that?  This seems to be FAR easier than what I would expect in my first few weeks.  I think in the real world you should expect to be working on a much larger codebase, stepping through a debugger to figure out what modules are interacting with each other, and working with internal libraries/frameworks that you have never seen before.  
Yeah this was more my experience. The actual code I wrote in my first few weeks was super simple, but the challenge was grasping the massive codebase, finding where in it the thing I was fixing even lived, understanding the related libraries, and setting up local environments which ranged from easy modern docker dev environments to some archaic legacy shit with no documentation that would take me 2 days to even get running.  
Bingo.  The end goal was pretty similar (center this element, remove validation from this input, apply relevant styles to match this mockup etc.) but the massive codebase is where the real challenge is.  It could easily take all day to do any one of those things.  
This is a great point. I‚Äôll consider a challenge to specifically tackle a larger codebase. Great feedback  
Honestly this is still the hardest part of starting in any new project/team even as a mid-level engineer.  
Yeah especially when you work in a huge place with loads of legacy code, often there's not even anyone left at the company who is familiar with the tool you're working on.  
Well, yes, of course the code base was much larger than this, but I meant it that this is a great way to get your feet wet and get an idea of what it will be like. Only difference is scale.  
You got something for cpp people??  
i don't have anything for cpp right now. If more people upvote your comment, I can def add it to the roadmap! I've made vanilla css/html/js challenges, and they seem to outperform everything else (React, Andular, etc) at the moment.  
I hope ü§û it gets... looking for a platform where i can learn on the job skills.  
Take my award as some sort of vote for cpp :D  
ty! cpp is clearly in demand!  
Github. Most cpp projects in github will have "good first question" labels. (rhetorical) "What have you searched, what have you found out?"

Many things are possible now thanks to Web Assembly.  
Are these like problems that occur in real jobs? Because these seem way too easy for that, and who is using Vanillajs in real jobs anyway? I am not trying to be hateful, I just think simple email/password validations and changing the name of a file in html does not simulate a real job. The code is also simple enough that it doesn't improve "reading other people's codes". Here are some tasks I think would be a little more challenging but still beginner friendly. ‚óè Frontend ‚Ä¢ Create a dark mode/language toggler that changes the current mode/language to another, you don't actually have to implement the dark mode/different language itself, just make sure changing the toggler on one page, any page, reflects the changes throughout (just add a text on every page that shows the current mode/language). Do you think it would wise to use Redux for this? Why or why not? If yes then implement it. ‚Ä¢ Create a loading screen for an asynchronous action while it is happening. It could be anything, for liking a button, getting data from an API just anything. Don't need to animate anything, just show a text like "data loading" during the action. ‚Ä¢ Create a mock server using json-server and create CRUD helper functions to communicate with the server. You can use Fetch, Axios or anything else. ‚óè Backend ‚Ä¢ Implement a register function that takes the username/password from the request body, validates the username and password (username must be over 5 characters long, password must be 6 characters long, have at least one capital letter and one integer. Then encrypt the password using something like bcrypt and save the user object. No need to save it to actual database. Printing the final validated and encrypted user object is enough. ‚Ä¢ Create a PUT method of an endpoint that edits a record in a database. Considering the database already exists and is given to you. Send appropriate response for successful edits or common errors (like that record doesn't exist, the field you are trying to edit doesn't exist). What would you do if 2 clients theoratically make request to update the same record at the exact same time, causing an edit conflict? How would you handle that? ‚Ä¢ Create a logger and errorLogger functions that log every action that happens to the api (like request method, request body, response headers, error messages etc) to the terminal. logger prints the normal actions and errorLogger prints all the errors. The routes are already built for you.  
Great feedback. If enough folks upvote your comment, I will look into building some of the challenges you've mentioned. Really appreciate it!  
If you want I can gladly help you with that :)  
I both agree and disagree lol. I definitely think some more advanced challenges would be much more helpful, especially someone about to enter the workforce. However, in a weird way I think this could also be excellent for someone considering taking this path at all. Not everyone is build for this career field. Maybe if someone you know was considering, you could send this and be like "okay so what did you think?"  
It depends. Sometimes tickets are this easy. Sometimes you‚Äôre building new projects from scratch and it won‚Äôt be a large code base. Sometimes you‚Äôre working on legacy code that is actually built in vanilla JS. With that said, yes if you want to go work at a well established tech corporation, this challenge wouldn‚Äôt prepare you for that. If you‚Äôre working as a contractor or at a startup, it might be a little more applicable. With that said, It‚Äôs probably ‚Äútoo easy‚Äù as a ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù. A challenge should push you outside of your comfort zone, and I think this might be too easy for that. This would be like, the tutorial challenge üò≠ to get you familiar with the concept. The idea behind it is a cool idea though. I could see the potential value for simulating real life coding tickets. Great job OP!!  
Man, this is great! I love how this can be an opening for fixing issues in other open source projects as well!  
Your amazing. Thank you for taking the time to do this.  
my pleasure friend! ü´°  
Did you just gamefy and outsource your job?  
lol "wait a minute..."  
This sounds amazing!! I‚Äôm just finishing up with the last css project in TOP foundations and then move on to learning some javascript, so I look forward to trying this once I‚Äôve got some javascript learning completed  
currently in a bootcamp, excited to try this out  
Do you care to share your bootcamp program? Is it in person or online?  What do you think about it so far?  I‚Äôve done some self paced online courses here and there and I was considering a bootcamp if it‚Äôs quick enough  
Hey sorry I didn‚Äôt get back sooner (I barely use Reddit)  I‚Äôm currently in general assembly set to finish the course on January 6th, It‚Äôs online and I pretty much enjoy it for the most part it‚Äôs a slow start but pretty much after week 1 the ball gets rolling, originally I was doing the self taught route as well but my discipline is horrible and often just steer off the learning and towards YouTube. I think it really depends on the person most people told me to go to college but no so I‚Äôm doing this instead. If you have any more questions feel free to pm me or just respond to this.  
Way cool! As a professional developer this is awesome for those looking to get more hands on. Nice work!  
Looks fantastic. This is exactly what I am studying but I'm currently at work now so il give it a try later.  
If you want to simulate real swe work just start contributing to significant OSS projects and give yourself deadlines  
You deserve some feet pics fa this you goat  
I tried already but he just resold them for profit. How's a man supposed to make a living.  
Thank you so much,ill use it  
Great idea!  
Very niche idea! Most practicing students and self taught devs don‚Äôt get to practice this skill very often!  
Sounds cool!  
This is awesome! It would be really cool to see this eventually expand to something like a game. With story cards, other teammates causing merge conflicts, etc. I don't know if all of that would actually be fun, but it sounds really cool in my head lol.  
This sounds like a fantastic idea. I work in an entirely different field, but the very same applies there - doing the job in practice is very different from studying the job in the abstract. Best of luck to you with this.  
I‚Äôve just started my bachelors degree in CS; I hope I can come back to this at some point in the very near future and understand what all of this means :‚Äù)  
this is a million dollar idea haha, there‚Äôs such a big gap between what you learn and what you need to know on the job; I love it!  
Sounds like a great idea! I'll take a look in a bit and probably send it along to some of my friends who are learning front-end.  
That's a cool idea! I definitely could have used something like that when I got started.  
Excited to see where you take this. Such a good idea, would love to work through some more complex problems this way!  
This is pretty awesome, thanks!  
I'm in uni and this is a phenomenal idea. Well done.  
I was literally trying to find something like this the other day, thank you!  
It's really cool ! And as another person asked, it would be even better if you had challenges for backend devs.  
You should include "writing proper commit titles" as a task. "Fix bugs" for example should be a more descriptive title like "fix src path for logo image" .  
Thanks! Commenting to check this out later.  
For additional accuracy, make sure you include requirements to implement things in a completely incorrect way, and also some requirements for arbitrary restrictions that only exist because changing the existing design pattern would hurt the architects ego.  
saved for later my g  
Great job! For those, who wants to check their skills as an Azure Developer, Azure DevOps or Administrator, I would suggest this app in addition.  
Thanks for sharing, I just started with learning development in cloud  
This is a great idea and also how my first job trained me. My coworkers broke all sorts of things in my first few months in order to have me debug things completely out of my comfort zone that I as a fresh junior would normally never be left with alone. Can totally recommend doing it to your juniors by the way, as long as they're comfortable with it (it's kinda soul crushing if the junior is insecure. One they did to me was "so our backend breaks for a few seconds every Tuesday morning with no errors logged, can you find out why?"...). My seniors had so much fun watching me struggle.  
Some ideas;  project doesn‚Äôt run and has obvious bugs because someone did a bad merge. Have like some localization file with duplicate keys and missing some keys, a bunch of other broken functionality and the person has to look at the merge history and previous versions and figure out what went wrong and fix it. Someone upgraded a library to a newer version and it introduced a bunch of sneaky bugs.  Find out why these features don‚Äôt work and fix it (deprecated methods or weird changes in library functionality / assumptions were made on return values or whatever).  
I'm hooked. I want more, I'm a spolied brat. No man, seriously, great, great job!  
Hi. I'm totally new to front end can I give a try?  
Yes!  
This was fun üî•  
Bookmarking this for after i get done with cs50 and learning more languages  
You‚Äôre the goat, jumping on it  
No thanks after seeing these posts line up https://imgur.com/a/8upDZqJ

What are the chances this guy is just getting people to do his work for him? /s  
Only a sly person would even think that. I hope you have good morals otherwise I fear for your coworkers!  
This is a really cool concept. I love the use of GitHub actions here. I wonder if there is a way to separate the actions from the sample repo to circumvent those that might "cheat"?  
I'd like to improve that at some point. Should be possible by hosting the test code separate from the repo.  
already on this! thanks so much  
You sir are a gentleman and a scholar!  
After this project, you can move up to simulating trying to be productive with a PIP hanging over your head!  
Cool idea, hope to try this out soon.  
where can we find your next challenges??  
You can browse our github org for more challenges here.  
This is super cool, gonna try this out but had a bit of a silly question, are we meant to fix all issues in one PR or is it meant to be tested as individual PRs.. does it even matter?  
Not silly! Fix them all in a single PR would be best, given how the automated tests work.    I should fix the readme to help clarify this.  
thank you for clarifying!  
Thank you so much for this. I‚Äôm a recent Physics grad trying to pivot into tech through QA analysis and I think this will help a lot.  
Thank you so much! This is so cool!  
Planning to add more challenges? Thanks for doing this, helping me alot!  
Yes! What would you like to see more of?  
Just more of the vanilla html,js,css issues :) and maybe some frameworks like tailwindcss?  
duly noted üôè  
Something simple but really nasty like a wrong parameter that contains an uppercase i instead of a lowercase L.  
I love this. I've seen similar projects for more advanced HTML/CSS/JS, but this is a sweet spot for where my students are at. I'm going to suggest a few of them try it out. Thanks!  
This is an awesome thing that you‚Äôre doing!  
That's badass! I'm super interested and will be taking a look into it.  
Thanks, bookmarked this thread although I'm not quite ready for it yet.  
This is great! What do you think the required skill set would be? I‚Äôm doing HTML/CSS/JavaScript and starting to get into react now.. I‚Äôm no where comfortable with either of the ones I mentioned above.. but I can find my way around ..  How do I get started with your assignments ?  
This sounds really cool! Can someone do this with little knowledge on SWE?  
This is a super cool idea.  Will work on it when I am home from work this weekend.  
This is actually a really cool idea!  
This is really awesome, I'll give it a try ü§ûüèæ  
Me when software engineering == Vanilla HTML & CSS  
All I can say is I love this. Thank you so so so much for the time and effort.  
I like it!  
How do I join?  
Brilliant, great work. What a good way to encourage those who have the skills but may lack the confidence to go for the job.  
This is a great idea! Thank you OP!  
I'm Seb too, and Tech Lead. Opening this thread was interesting. Good luck with your project.  
Senior web dev simulator is just ‚Äúimport this library‚Äù  
Great initiative man!  
This is amazing. I can't wait to try it  
This is a wonderful idea  
Saving this post. I think you have good YouTube videos as well. Appreciate it!  
I‚Äôll give it a shot tonight after work.  
How about working with Jira and being able to receive a ticket with a bad to no description and knowing what to do to ask the right questions and gather necessary requirements.  
This is so cool! Finally someone who gets it and not some ‚Äúcontent creator‚Äù regurgitating the same bs the other 300 of them say.  
This is so cool! Finally someone who gets it and not some ‚Äúcontent creator‚Äù regurgitating the same bs the other 300 of them say. Teaching a man how to fish!  
Commenting to come back tonight to try out!  
Neat  
Thumbs up  
Dope will check it out thanks  
Very interest and there are other projects available. Was curios if Projects in a real software engineering job, had a very detailed Project README or Documentation.  But thank you for the effort and spending time, i did not knew this was existed for a long time now.  
I know, web developers are not aware but there is also such thing as reading logs.  
Free labor baby!!!  
Upvoted for helping out the newcomers. Thanks for taking the time and effort.  
Thank you! Manifesting to be a software engineer 3yrs from now.  
This will be helpful for me. Thanks so much for sharing. I am a ui and ux designer with a web design and development background  
yeah sure OP, you're just getting people to review your code for free /s  
This is an amazing idea!  
I would love it if a project has like 10 bugs and at the end there will be a feature implement simulation. Fixing 10 bugs will also help you understanding the code base, so you can try to implement a feature using existing architecture. Of course it's really hard to check whether a solution is using proper architecture.  
If you wanna do a proper "job simulator" you also need to include code review that doesn't upset people. And mandatory BS scrum things, like estimates and stand ups and such. (Could just be a 15 min audio tape of random gibberish for the stand up, and 1 hour for estimation)  
Only if I get paid for it  
Whoa this is awesome!!  
As a student I am constantly having to fix broken code I plagiarized from the free section of chegg üòÇ For real though what you describe is a little bit covered in my cengage class. They give us broken code to debug. But from a short look though your mobile ui is 10x better than cengage. I'm going to try it again in the daytime. Good luck  
Commenting here for later, this looks like a great experience  
I‚Äôm very excited to dig into this.  
This is so incredibly helpful thank you OP  
Wow, thank you  
This is a great concept!  
This is so cool! This is definitely the new approach I‚Äôve been looking for. I‚Äôve been coding for over 20 years but it has never been my actual job so I‚Äôm missing the practice.  Thanks for this! I‚Äôm absolutely waiting for more challenging tasks to complete. Hopefully in the backend as well or even better a complete full stack challenge.  
Thanks man! would love to try this sometime  
yes i wanted this type of job.  
Wow!! This is sooo helpful! ü§©ü•≥  
Hey I'm definitely going to check this out! Thanks for making this!  
This is a great thing, thank you for making it. I was talking with my friend two weeks ago and he was showing me git, tasks and similar so I would get the feel of it and he told me about a colleague of his that got his job by contributing to their project(it's open source) and for the last two weeks I've been thinking about learning enough and coming to a point where I would be able to code and interact with something real and now you're posting this. Thank you once more for taking your time and making this for us that are getting into programming. This is going to be a great practice tool, better than any other in my opinion  
This is exactly what I‚Äôve always wanted  
When the read me says to submit a PR to ‚Äúthis‚Äù repository, does it mean the one you forked? I‚Äôve never actually dealt with forking a repo before, so I don‚Äôt know what it does or how it works.  
When you click the fork button up top on the project repo page you will create a fork. This fork will be a copy (fork) of the repo, under you own github account. Once you‚Äôve made and pushed changes to your fork, github will offer to let you create a pull request back to the original repo. Create that pull request, and you will see our automated tests start running.  If you have any issues, pm me for help. üëç  
This is genuinely so cool! I‚Äôve really gotta start compiling a list of free resources to learn, there‚Äôs just so much. The Odin Project, that free Upskill full stack course, and now this!  
This might've been my problem if I wasn't self taught and 'learn to read other people's code'  wasn't literally my first hurdle  
Links below are some useful links to get your ready for an interview of this kind: React interview questions: https://github.com/sudheerj/reactjs-interview-questions Js interview questions: https://github.com/sudheerj/javascript-interview-questions Filter the conceptual questions that are likely to be asked and try to go through them everyday. Best of luck! edit: I've just gone through the questions again and noticed that most of the questions you were asked were picked up from these links.  
Thank you for the links. I added them to the end of the post along with a couple question lists that I used to prepare for the interview.  
Do you have something similar for backend languages  
lol there you go, use SEO to have companies use your own questions to hire you lol  
There are definitely some that I need to research, but surprisingly, I know quite a lot of those. Progress!  
Im not in js nor frontend. But this kind of post are really helpful.  
Right, totally diff but in tech but it‚Äôs a nice to know just in case type of post  
Extremely helpful! Thank you!  
Thank you for psoting this.  I am self taught too and been applying for 2 months now with no one reaching out to me  It's a bit disheartening but seeing what they asked you has me scared because I feel like I cannot answer most of those questions.  So perhaps I should stop applying and keep my studies going for now.  Even after completing an online bootcamp and doing UDemy courses, it seems obvious to me now that I still don't quite know what I am doing.  This was a big eyeopener and I really appreciate you taking the time to write this up for all us beginners!  
The best advice I can give you is to try to build a project of your own. I felt like my understanding of a lot of concepts solidified when I had to try to figure out how to make things work without the crutch of a video to tell me how, especially when I added Firebase to my project. I didn't know what a promise in JS was before I had to use them to make Firebase work. I read a lot of docs and StackOverflow topics, and it still sometimes took me hours or days to figure out bugs. I was able to stick with it because it was my own project, so I was more motivated to make it work.   Good luck in your learning and your job hunting. Stick with it, and keep applying as you go.  
I do need to think of my own project.  The apps I built in the bootcamp felt so easy since I was sort of "coding-along" if you will.  I can read the code and understand it but I get so stumped when I need to do it on my own.  Thank you for your words of encourgment!  I am going to try to think of something to build for myself this weekend!  
Fellow self taught dev here, a neat trick I found to decide what project to do is think of a really small part of your day that would be easier if the computer did it for you, e.g. me and a friend used to text each other when a particular wine was on offer. I used this and wrote a quick script that scrape‚Äôs the websites of the supermarkets we shop at. Then add layers to it. How can I make this a server to add new items and check the latest prices? How can I generalise it so it‚Äôs not just the wine but all items at supermarket? How can I add notifications when the price changes? I‚Äôm now planning on adding a front end so that users can track their favourite prices. It‚Äôs small but I‚Äôve found the smallest little idea can be built upon and dressed up to become a full stack application. I‚Äôm clearly over engineering this but it‚Äôs a toy for me to experiment with new concepts. E.g let‚Äôs add typescript, let‚Äôs add prisma, let‚Äôs move to SQL rather than a json file as the db.  
A graph sounds like a nice idea‚Ä¶  
What bootcamp did you do?  That‚Äôs unfortunate - as I‚Äôve heard some great success stories from a 3-month bootcamp.  Are you from a tech background? Most of the converts I know are from civil and mechanical engineering so we have some form of programming background and a problem-solving approach comes naturally.  I would assume it could take longer to ‚Äúthink like a programmer‚Äù from a non-technical background  
OP advice about building your own project is super critical. I self taught (still have much to learn) my self enough python to move from my last job to my current one. However, for like maybe 3-4 years i was on this on and off path were I would start a course and then a few lessons in I would stop(for various reasons) but one was definitely that I didn't feel I understood what I was learning (from reading many comments it seems thats a common theme) It was not until I was at my last job (which had nothing to do with programming) that one day I was fed up with redundant time consuming task and I went back to learn and applied as I went (I suppose that was my project) and everything finally began to click and I began to understand it and enjoy it. So my take away is start a project and find something you have an interest or something that is relative as your project. That will make the learning experience easier. Sure you can pick a random project but if it has no personal meaning or ties to you it might just be tedious. Hope my 2 cents help. :) either way keep applying you never know when someone might be looking for someone they can teach on the job.  
I have actually built about 10 apps thanks to the bootcamp I took but for whatever reason it doesnt really sink into my brain.  I have a few more extra apps I am going to build that I didn't need to finish the bootcamp so hopefully completing those will help too.  Recently I have been focusing on codewars and trying to complete kata's but those are just as hard. ‚Äã I am where you were too.  I just can't with my curent job (a sales role) and I am not getting younger (just turnned 37) so I am trying to spend about 4 hours a day on this.  I really like front end work more than back end so I have sort of been focusing more on Java Script recently.  
I'm close to retirement age learning full stack dev.  Hang in there and enjoy the journey.  
Are the apps you build guided projects? I found that I couldn‚Äôt learn until I started taking everything into my own hands‚Ä¶ I work in data science though so might be different‚Ä¶. Just keep going I know you‚Äôll find it! I‚Äôm currently in a 4 1/2 month job search slump too so I‚Äôm right there with you! It can truly destroy your soul especially when you know you‚Äôre capable of the work.  
They are self guided.  I am currently making another self guided too and while I go though it I am like "okay yes, I remember this" or "okay, I know that!" but I think once I'm done I will be right back to "shit, I feel like I don't know anything".  Ahh being in data science probably helps a lot.  I am in sales currently so this is all foreign to me.  I am sure you will find something soon though, 4 and a half months seems like a long time so something has to be around the corner any  day now!!  
Sorry for the delayed response. Hmm that seems tricky‚Ä¶for me it wouldn‚Äôt stick either but it wasn‚Äôt until I was able to see the benefit of programming in something I needed. That like made a lightbulb go off and then everything made sense. Which is hard if you are in a sales job and can‚Äôt really work on something at work that will help you practice.  Would it be possible to perhaps look at like what specifically you do at work and see if there‚Äôs some stuff you can work on? For example when I used to work a sales job at a call center I was in charge of creating the daily call reports, not because I had some higher authority over my team but rather because I worked the last shift so everyone was able to send me their metrics for the day and I would manually compile them and send it out. Looking back now, that‚Äôs something that I could automate now using Python. So things like that, like finding things you do at work now that don‚Äôt have to be automate or whatever but just to give you a project that you can relate too if that makes sense. The reason I suggest finding relatable projects is because the lightbulb moment for me came when I worked on trying to automate my task at my old job. I studied GIS (Geographic Information Science) which is essentially tech dealing with spatial data so maps and what not. For my job I had to essentially create a report and also had to calculate some numbers and I had to pretty much do that every day and so I recalled some profesor in school telling me to not graduate with out learning Python of course back then I tried but ran into your issue that it just didn‚Äôt stick. So once I began to try and automate the tedious task I had to do everything began to click. It wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúoh I remember this/that‚Äù it was more so oh that works the same way as what I do manually this snippet of code is doing the same thing I‚Äôm doing when I click here here and there. Or type this and that. Or the best one ‚Äúthis loop is going through all these records on this table in .05 seconds while I manually took like 3-5 minutes‚Äù lol  
A lot of programmers deal with imposter syndrome. It‚Äôs hard to feel like an expert when I have to copy/paste hooks from the React docs because I don‚Äôt have it memorized. I have a bachelors in CS and about 5 years of professional experience with React with 3 different companies. I don‚Äôt know any other front end frameworks, I specialize in React, it is my safe space. I have made browser extensions, phone apps, and countless web apps in React, and I don‚Äôt know what a ‚Äúmixin‚Äù in React is. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to answer the typescript questions, and I might struggle with a few of the other questions because that‚Äôs not my specialty. I can do Node and database work, but it wouldn‚Äôt be as fast or pretty as someone who specializes in those areas. It‚Äôs okay to specialize. It‚Äôs okay to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù. I think it‚Äôs literally impossible to know everything in the JavaScript world. It‚Äôs just too big. Do what you can, and don‚Äôt give up.  
Thank you for your reply!  This helps make me feel a lot better about it.  I have been focusing recently more on front end learning as I really like that better.  Mostly getting more familiar with Java Script.  It's nice to hear someone who has been doing it for a while AND has a CS degree say that even they wouldhave a hard time with some of those questions.  I also believe if I could get a job and focus on that full time, rather than just doing this in my free time, I would get better with it too.  I hope by the end of the year I can make that happen.  I started learing in September of last year and I know it can take some time.  I really apprecaite your reply, thank you so much!! <3  
I'm in a very different world of programming/tech than being an actual full stack dev, but you are correct. Some people will want to see if you have the humility to say "I don't know but I'm more than willing to learn"  
OP gave good answers. They demonstrated desire and ability to relate unfamiliar knowledge to existing experience and reason about it.  
Keep at it!  
Thank you!!  I have been learning for 10 months so I have some too far and spent too much time to give up!  I'm going all the way!  I was never a good student in school but I have really been trying with this.  
Embellish your resume, get interviews, and learn through interviews. It will show you your blind spots. You don't have to take the job of you don't like.  Web development market is hot right now, I'm not sure why you aren't getting interviews.  Add a fake start-up to your resume to give yourself work experience.  Use indeed one-click apply. Apply to companies all around the country.   Even if you aren't interested in moving or working for them. Just get some interview experience.   When started looking for work, I did this.  100 applications in a week.  Interviewed a few times, got an offer.  I faked it till I made it.  Worked with that company for 5+ years and changed for a pay increase.    I recommend lying on your resume.  Don't let them make you self-filter.  Just interview a lot.  
Oh yeah I apply for all the jobs I can on LinkedIn.  I have had one interview but it was not really for a dev job (it was more automation and connecting API's) and he didn't ask me any programming questions at all.  I might possibly add a fake start up because I think putting 0 work experience on the jobs I apply to is kind of like automatically sending my submission to the delete bin haha.  
I would strongly recommend doing a course on coursera called "Learning how to learn" or read the book "A mind for numbers" which contains basically the same info, the course is free, but it's given me lots of insight on actually learning stuff and understanding instead of mindlessly chipping through content and later forgetting everything in the next days.  
Hi, what would you say are the top concepts from those books that help you the most?  
I still haven't finished the book but here is what I can summarize so far:  We use two "modes"  of our brain when learning, the focused and the diffuse mode.   The focused mode is when we are putting all our attention into something to try and understand it. The diffuse mode is when other parts of your brain work in the background to move things from the focused mode into the long-term memory, or to solve a problem you are thinking on. The diffuse mode is when other parts of your brain work in the background to move things from the focused mode into the long-term memory or solve a problem you are thinking on. The diffuse mode is when you get that "AHA!" moment while doing the dishes, or relaxing.  Chunking concepts: the art of understanding.   When you learn something new, try to focus on it first, then interleave your study session (don't study the same thing, or in the same context always)  by studying something else. When you learn something new, try to focus on it first, then interleave your study session by studying something else and let your diffuse mode kick in, you can work out, sleep, go for a walk, etc, focus on something else. Learning something new is like building a wall with bricks one by one; if you try to cram everything at once, you don't leave time for the cement to dry and make a solid wall, you get instead a hot mess that doesn't make good connections in your brain and you forget it the next days. To make "Solid walls" you need to really focus at first, try to understand the concept don't just blast through the content, go slow, use analogies, try to remember what you just learned, and rest. Then try to remember what you learned some days after, this reinforces your neural connections and stores the concept you are learning in the long-term memory.  Flash cards can help. To make "Solid walls" you need to really focus at first, try to understand the concept don't just blast through the content, go slow, use analogies, try to remember what you just learned, and rest. Then try to remember what you learned some days after, this reinforces your neural connections and stores the concept you are learning in the long-term memory Zettelkasten method of making notes. Think of chunking a concept with the following example:   When you learned how to wash your teeth for the first time, you focused on how to apply toothpaste to the toothbrush, that you do it in circles, for X seconds, etc, because you chunked that concept, when you think of "I have to brush my teeth"    Avoid the illusions of competence   Avoid just making long notes in your notebook, keep it at a minimum, just concepts Highlighting and mindmaps aren't as effective as trying to remember what you just learned, this is backed by studies. TRY TO REMEMBER after every study session.  Procrastination   Use the pomodoro technique Think in processes, not products, by this I mean, do not think of "I need to get an A in math", think more like, "I have to read 10 pages of the book today, and solve three problems"  Make a to-do list of the things you need to do the next day before you go to sleep.   I really recommend you take the course on Coursera which is free or read the book, they're amazing. I'm paraphrasing a lot but I hope some of the concepts are clear.  
look into MOOC.fi full stack course, it's free and awesome  
I too am self taught. I've been applying for probably around 8 months for a dev position. I finally accepted an offer at a company. I have a couple hobby projects I've written and actually have a passion for them. I think personal projects are pretty big for someone who is self taught. Try not to get discouraged, I know it's hard but you can keep learning and find a position you like!  
In one of my previous junior roles I was asked really similar questions in the interview. I was able to answer 90% of them and was invited to the next round at end of the interview.  I‚Äôd strongly recommend to any newbies to challenge themselves to build a full stack site only using the techs documentation. No stack over flow or similar sites. If you get stuck , pull up the documentation instead and find the section related to your problem. 9 times out of 10 you‚Äôll be able to find the solution to your problem and you‚Äôll understand the tech way better as you‚Äôll pick up more context along the way.  
 I‚Äôd strongly recommend to any newbies to challenge themselves to build a full stack site only using the techs documentation. No stack over flow or similar sites. If you get stuck , pull up the documentation instead and find the section related to your problem.   This is less of a recommendation and more a reality if you're using anything newish, at least that's been my experience so far, especially in javascript realm. Most fixes I've used for even something like a weird issue or question with my editor, VSCode, has been found/answered by the documentation on github and more often than not by searching issues on github. Github issues definitely seems more useful to me at this point than stackoverflow.  
 Github issues definitely seems more useful to me at this point than stackoverflow  This has definitely been my experience with JS. Every time I try SO I get 6-year-old results with long-dated advice and my issue ends up being an issue I found on github related to a version released three weeks ago lol  
This ^ . I have been working my way up at a major company and learned a lot of sql to start. Made my own acces database 5 years ago and now am a sole member of a systems engineering dept.  As someone who has been self taught (frustratingly around more experienced folks that wouldn't really take the time to teach) and has just hit the job market for the first time after a year in a full time backend role, EVERYONE has their own web page when they're actively looking on the market these days. 40 bucks a month to host your own AWS. If I wasn't in 2 late stage interviews, with A LOT of bites elsewhere, (and trying to leverage a market valuation increase at my current role to finish/start some more resume fodder projects) I would absolutely have my own lil bio web page at least detailing my experience and showing that I could do it.  Do I know/work in front end? Not really. Can I make a CSS template? Yeah I have before (thanks old high school HTML class!). Have I built my own APIs? Only locally but I'm fairly versed in CI/CD thru github/docker/k8s and am confident I could figure out AWS.  I think a big piece of what I'm trying to pass here is that once youre familiar with object oriented programming, (get a focus and have a project like OP that serves a definable purpose) a lot of languages are now legible with some extra doc-scanning here and there to fill in the gaps. And then from your first language to the second, the transition becomes much easier. I'd definitely say let your development/ideas/projects guide you. And dont pigeon holw yourself! There's definitely a lot of value in sheer breadth of knowledge, and it seems a lot of front end folks these days kinda loose sight of it. It makes sense, being that a lot of the modern languages are much more versatile standalone and have functions you could only do as easily on the backend a just a few years ago, but still.  I may be biased from my dev journey, but it seems like a lot of the freshman engineers/interns I work with are befuddled when they encounter a real-world shitty mess of a DB because a lot of the open source and academic DBs are made too perfectly. I'd say the same goes for actual code development. If you can make mistakes and learn the hard way what makes certain practices good, the better off you'll be. Granted, while i did have templates to work off of when I started and example code to copy/pasta (and do feel thankful and lucky for it), I definitely bucked trends and learned the hard way what it's like to shutdown production. Nothing sticks better than learning from mistakes by going out on a limb! (Be it your own project that you stumble through or what not!) And there's nothing wrong with copy/pasta-ing stack overflow! Just don't think you know it until you do! If it's literally just dropping something in to make it work, fmeh, sure maybe at first, but try to understand the how and why so that you can at least modify it to start, then later as you build more for different applications, you'll want to pivot the use cases which will encourage a more thorough understanding. All humans start by learning through replication  
I'm still kind of a noob myself, but I find it interesting he asked you about mixins. My understanding is that they haven't been common to use with React in years (long before I started learning the library) and have been replaced by hooks. Higher order components (again as I understand it) aren't as common these days because they've been largely replaced by hooks as well. Speaking of which, it's interesting that they didn't ask you about hooks at all.  It seems like their React questions are a couple years out of date.  
I was also surprised they didn't ask about hooks. I was ready to talk about them.   The company has been around for a while (>10 years), so they probably have some older code.  
I usually ask: how can you recreate class component lifecycle methods in a function component, and they‚Äôd better answer with the appropriate hooks.  
I'm my experience they ask about stuff they have code for, so older companies will have older code for the most part.  I mean hell, my company still uses divs and var. Let me tell you how fun it is redoing all of it...  
Unironically the best post I've ever seen on r/learnprogramming  
I would definitely read up on arrow functions. They are a life saver.  
Yeah, I was kicking myself for forgetting the 'under the hood 'distinction. I know how to write them no problem and generally prefer using them when I can.  
I'm still learning, so I want to make sure I'm correct. Aren't arrow functions special because they don't get read when the js file loads. I think its called being hoisted. Declared functions can appear anywhere in the document and be called. Arrow functions can not. Is that the answer an interviewer would be looking for?  
Aside from the syntax and stuff like implicit return, the biggest advantage of arrow functions is that they do not have their own this. If you use this inside an arrow function it will use the value of this from the closest outside context (i think). Regular functions have their own this which is dynamic. This means that using this inside of an arrow function will usually behave the way you think it would as opposed to a normal function, which will sometimes not. The situation in which this comes up this most is when you use give a method that uses this to a callback function. With a regular function you'll need to bind the this to the object for it to work. You don't have to worry about that with arrow functions.  
Thanks for the detailed explanation. It makes a lot of sense. I knew all of the pieces, but this puts them in the right spot. Thanks  
They were probably looking for how 'this' works.  
[deleted]  
Kind of, ‚Äúthis‚Äù in arrow functions is bound to the outer context in which it was defined.  
To be honest, I'm a senior dev doing Typescript and React. I couldn't answer a third of these off of the top of my head. If, for some reason, you don't get the job, don't sweat it. There are plenty of software jobs to be had with the knowledge you have now.  
Same here. I found the questions really poor and is a poor way of gauging a candidate's ability.  
yeah i was gonna say that the correct answer to these questions is probably:  those are textbook medstudent type questions that have absolutely no utility in the real world.  I understand the logic behind all the things you have asked and if im unsure about how one of these things act i can get google to tell me in less than a minute.  
same here but my excuse is that im learning js and react on the job lol i got in thanks to my experience with other languages  
I'm very early in my JS learning atm but this post did panic me somewhat. It seems like you need such a scope of knowledge for even just a junior role. Even though I'm not the OP, thank you for the reassurance.  
Amazing read. Could someone please answer those questions with the correct answers? I didn't know the answer to some of them.  
[deleted]  
1a: var, let, const? var is hoisted, let can be reassigned, const cannot. b: I don't know what they mean by this question -- what kind of object? c: typeof d: == uses type coercion e: arrow functions inherit their this from the enclosing scope f: callbacks are functions you pass along to run at some later stage/state/event. 2a: types b: the transpilation step can be a bother, I guess? c: private can only be accessed by the containing class (ish), public not so 3a: I don't know, why do you? b: fuck me if I know, modular design and reusability I guess? c: It's syntactic sugar over a javascript function that will return HTML It's syntactic sugar over a call to React.createElement d: props are immutable, state is not e: it's in the name f: it's in the name g: it's a library to handle routes in react h: Expand on the question, please. What kind of events are we talking about? i: a HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. j: no idea k: It's a variation of the flux pattern; immutable state, to change state you dispatch actions which you catch in reducers to derive the new state. 4a: Ugh. This is too open-ended to bother with, but if you think you're going to need NoSQL, you probably don't. Almost all data has some kind of relationship to other data in your application, so use a regular SQL database. I'm a fan of redis, though -- that's a nice piece of engineering.  
regarding question b: I think it's about how you can create an empty object: by using object literals or the Object.create method.  
Just some notes to add: 1a: var, let, and const are all hoisted (I think functions are also, generally, hoisted). But var has a default value of undefined, whereas let and const do not. This is why a var can be used before explicitly initializing it, but let and const cannot - that is to say, let and const MUST have an explicit initialization where var already has one (undefined) when it is declared. 1f: A callback is a function that is passed as a parameter of a function which is run within that function. 2a: TS also supports interfaces, where JS does not. 4a: I think you're right with that (too vague a question). I think though, the buzzwords they're looking for includes the VERY high-level overview of the difference between SQL and no-SQL.  
Very good notes, thank you! Yeah, my ts answer was very short, good addendum. The major difference between var and the other two is that var is hoisted and initialized to the beginning of the enclosing scope while let and const are hoisted to the beginning of the block, but aren't initialized at that point. I think. I don't work in js that much. Edit, in order to stave off any more people thinking that let and const aren't hoisted: they are. Both let and const are hoisted to the top of the scope, but they're not initialized at that point (here, we must keep the difference between hoisting and initialization in mind). var is default initialized when hoisted (to undefined), let and const are not, they are only initialized when the line of code declaring the variable is executed (and that is also when var is changed from undefined to whatever the declaration specifies). I only said I don't work much in js (and I was a little unsure whether I got it right or not), so thank you to everyone that made me read js documentation on a sunday morning, lol.  
Just to add to what everyone is saying about var vs let/const. Var is globally scoped when declared outside a function vs let & const which are block scope. This comes up more in my day to day than hoisting personally. Also, let and const are hoisted but not initialized. Var is also hoisted but it is initialized as undefined (const and let are not).  
For anyone interested in the answers, here you go:  What are the different types of variables in JS? How are they different from each other?   I`ll be honest, I don`t get the question here. Some interpretations are given below In how many ways you can declare a variable? That`s 3 ways: using const, let and var. The difference is in the scope - const and let are block scoped - same as in C/Java/etc while var has function scope(which means it is hoisted to the top of the function). The second difference is that let and var allow you to change the reference while const doesn`t Another interpretation is reference and value types variables. Another interpretation is that there are 7 types:    number - represent the floating point numbers string - immutable character strings object - composite type undefined - value for variable not found at all symbol - a special type of value that is always unique function - a special type of value that can be called to execute code boolean - true or false   What are some different ways to create an object in JS?   By literally defining the object: const a = {a:1, b:'Hello Mon!'} By using the new keyword to instantiate a class: const map = new Map(); By cloning const a = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)) or const a = structuredClone(a)  How can you get the type of a variable in JS?   You cannot usually get the concrete-most type of the variable, but you can use the typeof operator to know from which of the 7 aformentioned families it belongs. If it belongs in the object familly, you can do further checks with the instanceof operator to know if it is of a certain class.  Can you tell me the difference between == and ===?   One is coerced equality and the other is strict equality. The later compare things as is, without coercion, while the former tries to convert values to the same type and then test equality  Do you know what arrow functions are? How are they different from traditional functions?   Arrow functions do not have the this keyword and cannot be used as constructors.  What can you tell me about 'callbacks?'   A callback is a function that executes when an event happens. For example, when you call me back and say "You passed the interview" I will execute the ()=>console.log('I accept your offer') arrow function   ‚Äã  What are some features of TypeScript that JS doesn't have?   Type annotations, generics, decorators(still a stage 3 proposal).  What are some disadvantages of TypeScript?   It can be overly strict Lots of low level and high level options to configure in the tsconfig.json  Exists only at compile time  What can you tell me about access modifiers?   They are the classic OOP ones: private - accessible only inside the class itself protected - accessible only inside the class itself and from subclasses public - accessible to everyone Bonus points for saying that:   In TS-land they exist only at compile time and will always compile down to public access(as is the default in JS) There are native private access modifiers, but they are declared with a #. Example #IamPrivate = 10     
Continuing here Bear with me here, I am not a React master, but I should be able to answer those too  Why do we say, 'Everything is a component' in React?   This could be a tricky question, because components are not the only React notion, there are also hooks, so no, not everything is a component :))) Can`t give any other interpretation here, sorry  What are some advantages of using React?   Separation of concerns into components  What can you tell me about JSX?   A syntax made to resemble HTML and that gets compiled to javascript at build time.  What's the difference between 'state' and 'props?'   Props are passed from the parent to the child component while state is internal to the component itself. A parent component can pass a prop that can alter the state of the child component.  What is the difference between a 'stateful component' and a 'stateless component?'   A stateful component has an internal state and actively keeps track of it, while a stateless component doesn`t keep track of its own state.  What is the difference between DOM and Virtual DOM in React?   The DOM is the Document Object Model and represents the tree of HTML elements on the page The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the DOM tree that react uses to keep track of what and when to render.  What is React Router, and why would you use it?   You use react router when you want to show the user multiple pages without reloading the application. It allows you to change the URL of the page and change the components based on it.  What are 'events' in React? How are they different from events in JS?   Of the top of my head, no ideea. I found this tho Event Handling in React  What is a 'higher order component?'   A component that wraps another component given as a prop  What are 'mixins' in React?   No ideea. Sorry  Have you used Redux? What can you tell me about it?   A library for global state management. It works like this:   We define a state object We dispatch actions, eventually with props Those actions trigger different reducers that apply changes to the state object We query the state object using selectors For async changes, we use effects.    ‚Äã What can you tell me about different kinds of databases?  There are 7 paradigms of databases, see this video for more info  ‚Äã What experience do you have with backend languages, like Node?  Node is not a BE language, it is a JS runtime that allows you to run JS code even without a browser. This means that you can build CLI utilities using JS Most of the things you already know from Browser JS apply in NodeJS too. It ships it`s own module implementation called CommonJS For web apps, you have Express and Fastify if you want low level control and NestJS if you want a full power BE framework There is no window object in NodeJS   
You and the OP are fucking awesome sharing this!!!  
Hey thanks for this! It was really helpful. Can you talk about what the initial phone interview was like and how your resume looked like as a self taught person? Did you list non relevant tech experience on there? What that app the only project you did?  
The initial phone interview was with an HR person. She asked me to confirm my education listed on my resume and to talk a little bit about my projects and current working situation.  She then gave me a bit of background on the company, saying that they're maturing and at the point where they have enough senior devs and are looking to start mentoring and investing in more juniors.   Then she gave a rundown of their full interview process, including the coding test on HackerEarth, the Technical Interview (this one), and then the 'company fit' interview with the execs, which she said was mostly a formality if you get to that point.   My resume includes my 2 most recent jobs (program lead for a language teaching program, and currently a teacher in a different language teaching program), and it includes 2 projects I am currently working on. One is the meal planner mentioned in the post, which is up on my GitHub and hosted live on my website. The other is one that I have the idea for but haven't started yet. I think I know enough about what to do with it that I can talk about it, but I don't actually have anything to show for it yet. It probably shouldn't be on there...   I also listed technologies that I have used, including the ones in this post and some others like Illustrator and Figma. I do have some freelance graphic design experience, but only for people I knew or organizations I was a part of, no cold calling or running a business or anything like that. I did not include those jobs.  
Thanks for the reply, I hope you get that final interview! Good luck!  
That's quite a bit of questions ha. Also funny "nice to have" container orchestration, hey... I know you're a junior but...  
Do you mean this as in "obviously juniors should know that"?  
the opposite, although it seems front end roles start to blend with backend  
This did provide great insight for me, thank you so much and all the best to your future goals  
Thank you! I'm glad it was helpful.  
Do you find a bachelors in linguistics helps you understand coding concepts, even if it isn‚Äôt related? Linguistic structures are a big concept in both underlying CS ideas in language design and overarching application design like NLP.  
I think it has been helpful in a broad sense. I'm a big grammar nerd, and I like analyzing syntax patterns and stuff like that. I took a logic course where we learned logical expressions and worked on translating natural English sentences into logical ones. That kind of systematic thinking seems to translate well to at least learning language syntax. I had no problem understanding &&, ||, ==, ===, for example. My biggest challenge has been changing the way I think to apply programming tools to create more logically elegant solutions to problems. I can usually hack a something together, but it's usually not clean or nice-looking or optimized.  
Yeah, interestingly, I think becoming a junior programmer means learning to deconstruct what you know of typical language to think and express statements more logically for computers. However, becoming a senior programmer means reconstructing those logical statements to become more expressive for typical language users.  Great code isn‚Äôt filled with advanced logical constructs but one that is easy for people to read, understand and change.  You may enjoy getting into the Ruby language soon, which is my world. It‚Äôs known as a very expressive one that encourages developer ‚Äújoy‚Äù (sometimes with cult like fanaticism). The Ruby community‚Äôs focus on TDD and DSLs make the whole thing an expressive experience; full of tight little functions and custom syntax that encourages readability in English. Especially interesting since it started as a toy language by a Japanese man in the 90s.  https://thoughtbot.com/blog/writing-a-domain-specific-language-in-ruby  
Every Ruby dev I come across absolutely just gushes over Ruby, I love it.  
I look forward to the day that I am a fluent enough programmer to be expressive with my code. The Odin Project actually hypes their Ruby on Rails course over their JS one. I was sorely tempted, but I chose JS because it covers React, which is very marketable right now. Once I have a good handle on React and have worked for a while, I'll check Ruby out. Thanks for the recommendation!  
I have a 30-year-old Bachelor's in linguistics and I agree with this.  
Saving your post for future reference, thank you for the write-up!  
Just tell them you know FlutterElectronXamarinCC++C#JavascriptTypescript*takesbreath*DOMHTML5FlashActionscriptSassAssemblyCOBOLBasicApple2CLogoPythonWxPythonPyGameAngularReactVueMoreReact.NetEverythingYay! Instantly hired. (Oh, and probably PHP.)  
Where is Ruby? ü§îü§î  
For my interview I wan't asked any coding question, just some coding problems and complexity analysis and this was a big company.  
I was surprised that they didn't want me to do any coding or problem solving for this, but I was happy about it too. I guess they figured if I got through the initial coding test, they didn't need to test those skills again.  
I feel really bad for giving just one single upvote to this post, cause deserves a lot more. Thanks a lot for sharing this  
Can you tell us the pay range please for this position?  
It was $58,000-$65,000 CAD. A little above average for junior postings I see in my area. Most are between $45,000-$55,000 CAD. Some go as high as $70,000 at the top of the range.  
This is so useful, can I ask how long you‚Äôve been learning for and where in the world you‚Äôre based? Also how hard was the coding challenge? What type of challenge would you say it was? Thank you for posting this :)  
I'm on the west coast of Canada, and I've been learning part-time for about 2 years. I spent the first year kind of farting around brushing up on HTML and CSS. I got serious last summer when I learned about The Odin Project, from this sub I think, and started diving into JavaScript. I wrote the first version of my main project in March this year, and it took me about 3 weeks (Spring Break + 1 week) of coding 5-8ish hours a day to get it mostly functional. The coding challenges were both multiple choice at the beginning and then one programming question at the end. The multiple choice were a lot of things I didn't know about the C language, SQL queries, common algorithms like finding prime numbers between 1 and 100, and high school math questions. One I remember was something like "If Brad can do a task in 10 days and Kate can do the same task in 15 days, how long will it take them to do it together?" The tests were camera-proctored and tab-switching was monitored to prevent cheating. The coding questions were both variations of sorting challenges. The second one was counting how many times racecars would overtake other cars if each number in array represented a car and its speed. The first one, I can't quite remember, something about finding the 5th largest number in a set, maybe? But it involved sorting. I didn't get it during the test, but some research after the fact made me think that bubble sort was the solution. I learned bubble sort after that and used it in the second challenge a week later and got a better score.  
Just in case anyone wondering, Brad and Kate will complete the task in 6 days: (1/((1/10)+(1/15)))  
Why isn't it simply half of their average?  
Consider it like filling a bucket with water. So, if Brad can fill the whole bucket in 10 days, then he can fill one-tenth (1/10) of it every day, while Kate can fill (1/15) every day. If they worked together then they will fill (1/10 + 1/15) of the bucket every day. Now to calculate the number of days they need to fill the whole bucket we need to find out how many times we need to add up (1/10 + 1/15) to get 1 or 1/1. Which can be calculated using the formula below.  (1/10 + 1/15) * X =  1 X = 1 / ( 1/10 + 1/15)  
Thank you SO much for posting this! I haven‚Äôt worked in the field yet, but I‚Äôm planning on starting to apply soon and I‚Äôm really nervous about the interview process. I made a post in another popular dev subreddit, asking about other people‚Äôs interview experiences, and I didn‚Äôt get a single response. Not even an up or downvote. This post is so helpful and gives me a lot of insight. Again, thank you so much for sharing.  
/u/jojawhi Did you get the job? I think your answers are pretty good for an entry level interview. Junior devs aren‚Äôt really expected to know much. We hire juniors purely on attitude and willingness to learn.  Also a bit of caution as you have more interviews: it is common for companies to include an NDA pre-interview to prohibit sharing of questions. I don‚Äôt think it was the case here, but just something to watch out for.  
That seems like a lot of questions for an interview. In my experience this isn't the norm for jr level positions.  
nah, I'm senior and this sounds just about right. asking questions that, honestly, don't have much to do with day-to-day work, but are trying to gauge technical ability. like you literally almost never worry or think about 90%+ of the time how to create an object in JS. doesn't matter that there is more than one way to do it. I'd personally rather know about their troubleshooting ability. Like what's their algorithm for finding/verifying a bug. how to diagnose it etc. where did the data come from, and how does it get set/mutated? where up the stack could this have happened? etc etc. edit: yes I know I said "like" a lot. it's Friday and I'm tired ü•±  
Interesting, I've never seen this many technical questions in an interview for a jr position. I even had some senior interviews that asked for less.  Maybe, it's different by region? I'm not saying it's not the norm, just that it hasn't been the norm for me.  
I think there's a difference between Jr and entry level but regardless I'd ask these questions. The idea is that the entry/junior have different answers but it's more about the thought process.  
Seems appropriate given OPs background. No formal qualifications or references or real work to speak of. Glad the company is actually trying to hire juniors from non-standard backgrounds. For that, you just have to make sure they actually know how to code and have an interest. And they can admit when they don‚Äôt know instead of lying.  
That's kind of what I was thinking. They probably had doubts.  
I got the impression that the interviewer didn't really want to be there. He was friendly enough, but I think because junior interviews are probably not what he wanted to be doing, instead of prepping a list of engaging questions based on my resume/github, he mostly winged it with a list of generic questions to just eat up the time. It is a bit of a red flag about the company culture, which is one reason why I'm kind of okay if I don't get this one. It was my first, and I mentally prepared for the rejection already anyway. If I do get it though, I'll have so much to learn and focus on that the company culture will be an after-thought. Edit: I want to clarify that I don't blame or bear any ill will towards the interviewer, and I may have totally misread him. It was hard to tell because his camera wasn't on. I've been in his shoes before (having to hire new teachers), and it's stressful in a different way, especially when you have a bunch of other projects on the go that are demanding your time.  
Probably. Don't sweat it.  
Great write-up. Thank you very much for this. It helped me know that I am on the right track! I was able to answer a good amount of the questions, although I will need to refresh and do interview prep when it's time to start applying, very exciting. I really hope you get the job! Such a great interview, I hope mine are like this!  
 I have one project to speak of. It's a meal planning web app where you can input recipes, and then add recipes to a meal plan and populate a grocery list from the ingredients of the recipes in your meal plan.   I know of an app that does this, but it can be pretty janky, it's called Paprika 3. Able to scrape recipe ingredients and instructions from (seemingly) any recipe page on the web, and add them to a grocery lists. Something about the latter functionality never worked that well for me so I only use it to store recipes. Keep going with yours, there's nothing like that that actually works well yet!  
I use an app called Recipe Keeper that is great at extracting recipes from websites (and pretty good at getting them from scanned images). It has a shopping list feature but I haven't tried it yet.  
I am a step behind you in a similar situation and really, really appreciate your post.  Thank you and hope to see an update.  Hope you get the position.  
I think these a poor interview questions. Reads like a CS mid term, memorization over execution.  
As a technical interviewer, these are typical open ended/vague questions to get an idea if you have experience in each of these areas. There's little here that would benefit from memorizing anything. If you have handson experience (even personal project experience) in any of these areas you will be able to easily answer these questions without much thought and it will be obvious to the interviewer if you're able to easily answer.  
Wow, that‚Äôs incredible you‚Äôve gotten so far with only FreeCodeCamp and TOP Foundations!  Great job üëç How long have you been learning for?  I‚Äôm teaching myself software Dev as I complete my Masters in Engineering - so this is very reassuring to hear. I love TOP but I am more interested in back-end/Python so unfortunately they don‚Äôt have a stream for that.  
Hey - I also used the ZTM Udemy course to learn React, and it has really helped me secure my current full stack development internship! Wish you all the best with your job!  
Hey, I'm a senior dev and been in the interviewers seat, and thought I'd point out a few things. Typically you don't have to get every question right, especially at entry level, it's not a quiz. It's just a discussion to determine if you're the right fit to work at the company/on the team. Saying "I don't know, I'll look that up / if I had to guess..." is a valid answer. Don't view that as an outright negative, it's the people that make shit up on the spot that we'll write off outright.  Since you don't have a ton of experience, it would be good to throw in how you've run into some of the concepts when answering questions. Hopefully an example where you used callbacks isn't too hard to come up with. Also, if you're going for full stack positions, you really need to hit that server side more. It would be helpful if you understood HTTP, how modern rest services work, and can implement an API in node with something like express or koa (maybe add a GitHub link to a server project on your resume). Id also recommend learning to write basic queries in MySQL or MongoDB. These days, you'll still probably get the most mileage out of MySQL.  
Congratulations OP  
We apreciate you posting this to show everyone what the real world is like.  
Nice one!  I'm a self taught dev. My degree was in Astrophysics. I started teaching myself C# in my spare time as a buddy of mine was trying to get me into game development using unity. I ended up getting hired for a junior full stack position in Web dev using ASP.NET which had over 200 applicants. To be honest I think they just liked me and I had a bit of luck üòÇ. I've been working in the field now for 5 years.  Technical interview went well and I had 2 projects they asked about, a blog site and a very small CRM both using the exact technologies they were looking for luckily! Don't give up, if your passionate about it that will shine through. Just need someone to take a chance on you. Good luck!  
This is very insightful indeed!  This interview sounds very similar to an interview I had a year ago for a technician (electronics) job I took, albeit in a much different field (instrumentation troubleshooting and repair for aerospace).  It seems very similar to questions I was asked relating to my field. Materials, problems, electricity, circuits, etc that are dealt with on a daily basis as well as some theory. I'm self studying systems programming/CS after taking a few years of college courses, so this is very helpful for when the time comes to start applying for Software Eng positions. Thanks for taking the time to share and Good luck in your journey!  
Thank you so much for posting this! Really helped me out!  
yo thank you so much for this. will try to do the same when I get my first interview üôè  
Really helpful!! Oh shit. I‚Äôve got to learn TypeScript.  
Thanks for posting this is a great resource and this interview no matter how it went can only help you in the future Godspeed  
If anyone wants to do a sort of study session where we go over materials and talk shop. Be sure to hit me up!  
Thanks you for sharing your experience!  
Ok to get all the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù answers from that is to much to ask i guess. So a different question: U said in the start that u organized your files from ur project properly halfway through. I want to do some playground project for myself but i want to have good file structure from the start. How u organize ur files?  
I left a list of short answers further up the thread. File structure depends a lot on what you're doing. I like one file per component in React, and bundling features of the app in directories (so "mushroom_generator"would have all the components (that are not part of my design system) and functions etc).  
Ty for the post. This gives me insight as to what to expect.  
Love this. Thanks for sharing. I do full stack but generally back end work so I don‚Äôt see many of these types of questions.  
I am also in JavaScript path of TOP but wanted to get right through react already through udemy. Only reason I haven‚Äôt yet was because a lot of people in TOP community tell me to stick to one thing only first. I admit I‚Äôm a bit slow so I don‚Äôt want to rush through these lessons but I do get stuck on the projects quite a lot lol. Would you say it‚Äôd be okay to try out react through udemy and come back to top later? Im only about to be finished with the todo project of the JavaScript path.  
Yes, learn in whichever way works best for you.  
I have an Android (Kotlin) dev interview next week, this helps me to prepare what kind of questions they might ask, big thanks!  
Super helpful post, thanks! Good luck to you, pop back in and let us know how it ends up  
I'm ss ing this. thank you so much for giving back to the community!  
This is amazing, thank you for sharing. I have an interviewing coming up in the next two weeks and this is exactly the kind of question I think they will ask.  
3.10. I have no idea what ‚Äúmixins‚Äù are in react. Did you know or find out?  
Good luck on getting the job, even if you don't it's a learning experience!  
This is awesome, thank you!  
Thanks for this! I‚Äôm also a former language teacher learning to code and building a portfolio. Do you have any tips for first projects? I was thinking an ats system that goes into a swipe interface that applies for jobs when keywords match descriptions.  
One interviewer, and they kept their camera off the whole time? You probably don't wanna work there anyway.  
The worst is when you know your shit, but not good at explaining it in technical terms.  I'm one of the dumb smart peoples.  
Fantastic post, thanks. Love these, how the sausage is made posts. Good luck.  
Thank you so much!!! Fingers crossed ü§û for you  
Could you talk about what the two coding tests were like?  
Very helpful! Thank you.  
This is super encouraging. Thank you for sharing!  
You did really well for your first interview.  I was very flustered during my first interview, but eventually got more confidence practicing with more and more real life interviews.  Keep this list of questions and any future questions in a doc and practice answering them regularly.  Leetcode sucks but keep practicing it to pass the initial coding assessments.  
I'm surprised you got to remember all those questions with how many they are, even if you didn't remember everything and with the guides afterwards. Still, thank you for sharing this! Best wishes that you get that job with great benefits OP!  
Thank you for the well wishes! Immediately after we hung up the call, I started writing down what I could remember, and then throughout yesterday and today I've been remembering snippets more.  
Really nice to get some inside info! Nice job landing the interview, and good luck continuing on your path.  
Dammm bruh u have great memory, i am 22 and i fuckin can't even remember what function call went to which file üòÇüòÇ  
Thank you for sharing this!  
Started Odin Project a month ago and just started learning JS today. Like you, I'm coming from an unrelated field (music and education) and am a bit older (40's).  Going to save this post for future reference. Thank you!  
You‚Äôre a saint for posting this  
This post alone made me join this sub  
This is awesome.  Why don't you expect to get the job? It seems like anyone that can remember all of those questions - and is cool enough to share them, should get the job!  
Interview sounds pretty easy if you learned everything in js. I could answer most of these questions. But this is a good post i will definitely make sure I know all the answers.  
This post is insanely well written and formatted.  
Good luck!  
Thanks OP and good luck! I hope you land the job but if you don‚Äôt just keep learning and trying!  
This is helpful,  thanks for sharing!  
Nice write-up.  How did you get the interview?  Were you referred by someone or just applied out of the blue?  I have read so many posts where people have applied to over 100+ positions without a response.  
Just applied, no referral. I think it helped that I'm semi-local to the company. It's a remote position, but I'm in the same time zone and can drive 90 mins to the company location if necessary.  
Im going through the same job hunting grind for a while now and  I've had similar experiences.  
Thank you for sharing!!  
thnx bro that was very helpful  
This is incredible. Thank you for posting!  
thanks for posting this!

Awesome and insightful writeup. Thanks.  
Thank you, i like this type of post.  
Pretty curious how it turns out! Hope you get the job!  
Thank you so much. I'm applying in a few months and this is one of the most helpful posts I've read. Good luck and I hope you get the job!  
Thank you so much for sharing, good sir. I wish good deeds on u.  ü§èüé©  
Very informative post, how did you prepare for hacker earth? I have an interview where I have to do some tests on hacker rank and I feel nervous  
They had a practice test I could do. I did that twice to learn the platform. Then I did a bunch of problems on the main site. I had a bit of difficulty figuring out how to manage their input/output system. I used JS/Node, so there was a lot of extra boilerplate code that was needed. I honestly didn't do very well. My solution only worked for 7/11 test cases because it was too slow in terms of time complexity. It would be good to learn how to write efficient algorithms for common problems. Avoid nested loops, for example.   This course might be helpful if you're using JS:   https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript  
You've detailed this so well, thank you OP!  
Helpful. Good job  
The people behind this job listing have no idea what should be expected of a junior. They‚Äôre hiring an intermediate at least. If you get the job, OP, make sure they‚Äôre paying you fairly.  A junior position is an entry level position. The only criteria for which you should be qualified for are ‚Äúgets along with other humans‚Äù and ‚ÄúI can turn a computer on‚Äù and as a bonus ‚Äúi have completed one or two online courses‚Äù.  
Incredibly written! That took quite a while to write. Great job and good luck to you. From a fellow School Teacher and Coach!  
Very helpful man thanks! I am in a similar situation, doing the Odin Project right now, and posts like this are reassuring! Best of luck on this and every future interviews!  
Thank you for sharing this! I'm going through similar courses and this gave me inspiration and confirmation that I'm on the right track. Edit: spelling  
This is really awesome of you to have shared this with others! People like you have my full respect. This was very helpful to me personally as I tested my thoughts and knowledge on this and I feel I had more or less your thought process and answers which I feel must count for something and I could use this for future interviews as well. Thanks a lot good sir/ma‚Äôm best of luck to you, I‚Äôll be waiting to read about the post where you get your first dev job c:  
Thanks for sharing! I wish you all the best üçÄ  
Good luck OP!  
Thank you for posting, extremely helpful.  
Out of curiosity, do developers usually have deep conceptual knowledge like this (e.g. virtual DOM vs DOM) without specifically studying interview questions? If so, what are the best resources to learn them? In my experience, I only have about enough knowledge to create functional applications without really having that conceptual understanding of what goes on behind the scenes. I probably rely too much on Stack Overflow.  
This is an amazing resource. Thank you very much for sharing as I too am in a similar situation.  
I work in IT and in my experience college education and experience mean almost zero. The fact that you went through the effort of self teaching and then applying would be enough for me. You can learn experience.  
Very helpful! Thank you for sharing!  
Thank you for this.  
Thanks for sharing your experience, I'm sure a lot of people will learn from this. I'd like to offer my opinion as a Software Architect who has interviewed many people. From the level of detail and the types of questions, I feel that this interviewer was relying on technical checks instead of performing an interview in the correct way. This is something I see often with folks that don't have skills in interviewing and assume it's about checking your skills. An interview (especially at big tech companies) is more about understanding how you think rather than making sure you understand every nuance of Javascript. I've interviewed hundred of people for Bit Tech and honestly I couldn't care less if they understood the difference between let and var, especially for a new developer. I assume if they are smart, they can look that up. In fact, a developer should look up stuff when they need to and I don't expect anyone to have that knowledge in their head. What is more important is understanding how they think. I do ask a coding problem, but we work through it together, looking at edge cases and interesting solutions. A bit part of the interview is the ability to work in a collaborative way. Of the many we've hired, most have gone on to senior roles or managers. Even a few have become startup founders. So just wanted to share insight and say that asking this many questions is not common nor productive imo.  
I think like 2 or 3 of these questions would have been fine, but honestly when I interview juniors I want to know how much they can actually code. They can always learn theory and the pros and cons of things later through experience.  Asking questions that can easily be googled is a waste of everyone's time. Can you debug yourself and are you able to ask questions when you're lost should be the main part of the interview.  How much do you know about fundamentals and how much are we going to have to teach should be discovered in questions, with the understanding that we as a team will have to guide and teach.  I remember when I was a junior I would pass the live coding and struggle answering theory and easily googled questions. I started just memorizing the answers to questions like these without actually understanding them to help pass them in interviews and thought about how stupid this interview game actually is.  
Thanks for sharing OP, this is super helpful!  
OP, what was the salary listed for this position and what kind of salary are you hoping for, for your first job  
It was 58k-65k CAD. In my application, I asked for the bottom 58k because this would be my first programming job.   I'm not too worried about exactly how much the salary is for the first job as long as it's stable and can pay the bills. I'm more interested in finding a place where I can get good experience and mentorship, and learn industry best practices and skills and grow as a developer.  
hired. You start tommorrow  
I hope you get the job!  
Hey OP, I am currently on the same path as you. I am up to the form section on the full stack js.  Is it possible that you can show your resume or a similar format to it?  Thank you as well for sharing this. It actually is inspiring me to actually just go for it. I have been too afraid to apply lately.  
Honestly, it wasn't my resume that got me the job I currently have. It was following the right people on LinkedIn and keeping the experience from my previous career as a teacher/manager on there instead of wiping it away like a lot of the bootcamps encourage you to do. I can't guarantee that approach will work for everyone, but networking is definitely something I would recommend putting at least a little effort into because you never know.
