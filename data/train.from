I turned 100 today and have built a LEGO set. AMA
Dude, congratulations for being 100!  I'm 16 (yeah I'm from a very younger generation but I like old, vintage retro stuff, even movies, too) and I appreciate that there's a lot of people turning 100. Sometimes I get jealous of them because they have a long life and they have a life before digital/internet stuff while I'm stuck here with digital stuff. I guess I'm born in the wrong generation.  Anyways, I have some questions... 1) Do you have a cell phone? I wonder if 100 year old people uses a cell phone like a smartphone or a flip phone.  2) What did you do as a little kid?  3) Have you seen classic movies like Casablanca, Jaws, Back to the Future, The Matrix and The Phantom of the Opera (1925 with Lon Chaney)?  4) What advice would you give to younger generations, even generations that came after you died?  5) How would you react to modern technology? 6) It might sound stupid but what's your opinion on LGBTQ? 7) Have you watched TV? 8) Have you seen old silent movies, especially with Chaplin, Chaney, etc. both as a kid and as a adult/elder?  9) What kind of music do you like? Country music? Rock? Rockabilly? Blues? You ever listened to Elvis, Tom Petty, The Blue Brothers, etc?  10 What's life in 1920s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s?  11) I bet you knew what's Netflix is. They had a lots of good shows that you're missing out on. I recommend watching "NCIS". It's good.  12) What's your favorite movie?  13) Tell us your favorite story about your wife and/or your family or anything else. I want to listen to these elderly people's stories before they vanished from life.  14) Do you enjoy books? Have you read Fahrenheit 451? What's your favorite book?  15) How are you holding up now in this global pandemic?  16) Where do you live? USA? England? Australia? or something? 17) Have you served in the military? What military branch you're in? What war do you fought in? WWII? Korean War?  Sorry if I have too many questions but I'm impressed that people lived a very long life. It's would be a shame that I never got to hear their opinions and their beautiful stories when they're gone. Enjoy your day, my man! Stay safe! Best wishes! -RayKVega

12:09 Captain announcement! Coronavirus is now officially known as Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019).  Laundry is at full capacity, and we‚Äôll get another chance for laundry! This is great, because we don‚Äôt have as much laundry this time. We should be able to get most of everything washed.  Social media is really reaching the captain - he recognized the huge amount of support coming from around the globe. He says ‚Äúclearly, the world is watching us, supporting us, and driving us until the end of this difficult time. Buon appetitio!‚Äù Fun fact! The tv is having an interesting problem today. Everyone‚Äôs TV is in French/Spanish! üòÖ 13:16 Captains announcement & correction on my end.  44 new cases of covid-19, totaling 218 now. All guests that are 80 years or older in interior staterooms, or 80 years or older with chronic medical conditions have been tested already. Those who test negative will have the option of disembarkation to government quarantine areas in japan to finish their quarantine. Those guests who were roommates of someone who tested positive cannot disembark are this time.  Also, lunch + menu for tomorrow - looks like they‚Äôre going to go ham for Valentine‚Äôs Day. Our UK friends across the hall are excited for fish and chips!  Here are some pics:  13:52 Received an email from the embassy. Looks like they will be offering voluntary disembarkation to guests aboard, starting with those most vulnerable (chronic health conditions, etc.) to Japanese government quarantine facilities. We would likely be the last to receive this offer, but are healthy and in good spirits. Here‚Äôs a link to the letter: 15:00 Our cruise directors brought is some board games!  16:15 The cruise directors made an announcement letting us know that there was new entertainment on our stateroom televisions, such as work out videos, stretches, magic lessons with Sunny Chen (fun fact, an internationally famous magician is quarantined with us, check him out), or napkin folding lessons on how to make a candle. A well-being message was also shared, asking us to make a steady routine for our lives while in the staterooms. 16:55 Captains announcement!  Process of disembarking is well underway. His last announcement is being printed and sent to us so that we are able to determine if we want to stay on the boat or not. We think we will go ahead and stay on the boat. He stressed to us the importance of wearing our masks at all times outside of the room. 19:06 Captains announcement!  As he put it, another day down, and we‚Äôre one step closer to being done with our extended stay together. Guests that are identified as priority (chronic diseases, comorbidities, 80+) will receive notice tonight by Japanese health officials regarding the option to stay on the ship, or be looked after by the Japanese government on land.  More videos have been uploaded to the tv - one of which from Princesses Chief Medical Officer, providing information on the recommendations from global health organizations and the Japanese health ministry regarding covid-19. Some are anxious about the spread of the virus, but the captain hopes that this will address each concern anyone might have.  He states that keeping everyone informed is one of their top priorities.  We still have barges helping us perform essential marine operations, and there is no need to go out to sea for the time being. We will stay docked to daikoku pier in Yokohama until further notice. The captain has been receiving a good amount of letters - he is pulling three quotes from these daily, and sharing with the crew.  He reminds us that the health and well-being of everyone aboard is their top priority. We were assured that everything was being done to bring this trying time to an end. Six days to go, whoop! 20:30 Got dinner! Today, the food situation was much a bit better. We liked both of our dinners compared to other meals, and we even got KIT KATS! We got some other Japanese snacks as well, such as (we think) fried/baked noodles! It‚Äôs nice to be able to try new types of snacks even while confined. I‚Äôm ready for kettle cooked BBQ chips (or crisps, depending on your neck of the woods), though.  Here‚Äôs a picture of the giant bridge over Tokyo bay during day and night, as well as a picture of our dinner. We‚Äôve had a long day - off to bed for us! Thank you all for sharing a part in this, will update in the morning. We appreciate the support! 21:05 Anyone know what this is? It was just delivered to our door. It‚Äôs heavy!

12:09 Captain announcement! Coronavirus is now officially known as Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019).  Laundry is at full capacity, and we‚Äôll get another chance for laundry! This is great, because we don‚Äôt have as much laundry this time. We should be able to get most of everything washed.  Social media is really reaching the captain - he recognized the huge amount of support coming from around the globe. He says ‚Äúclearly, the world is watching us, supporting us, and driving us until the end of this difficult time. Buon appetitio!‚Äù Fun fact! The tv is having an interesting problem today. Everyone‚Äôs TV is in French/Spanish! üòÖ 13:16 Captains announcement & correction on my end.  44 new cases of covid-19, totaling 218 now. All guests that are 80 years or older in interior staterooms, or 80 years or older with chronic medical conditions have been tested already. Those who test negative will have the option of disembarkation to government quarantine areas in japan to finish their quarantine. Those guests who were roommates of someone who tested positive cannot disembark are this time.  Also, lunch + menu for tomorrow - looks like they‚Äôre going to go ham for Valentine‚Äôs Day. Our UK friends across the hall are excited for fish and chips!  Here are some pics:  13:52 Received an email from the embassy. Looks like they will be offering voluntary disembarkation to guests aboard, starting with those most vulnerable (chronic health conditions, etc.) to Japanese government quarantine facilities. We would likely be the last to receive this offer, but are healthy and in good spirits. Here‚Äôs a link to the letter: 15:00 Our cruise directors brought is some board games!  16:15 The cruise directors made an announcement letting us know that there was new entertainment on our stateroom televisions, such as work out videos, stretches, magic lessons with Sunny Chen (fun fact, an internationally famous magician is quarantined with us, check him out), or napkin folding lessons on how to make a candle. A well-being message was also shared, asking us to make a steady routine for our lives while in the staterooms. 16:55 Captains announcement!  Process of disembarking is well underway. His last announcement is being printed and sent to us so that we are able to determine if we want to stay on the boat or not. We think we will go ahead and stay on the boat. He stressed to us the importance of wearing our masks at all times outside of the room. 19:06 Captains announcement!  As he put it, another day down, and we‚Äôre one step closer to being done with our extended stay together. Guests that are identified as priority (chronic diseases, comorbidities, 80+) will receive notice tonight by Japanese health officials regarding the option to stay on the ship, or be looked after by the Japanese government on land.  More videos have been uploaded to the tv - one of which from Princesses Chief Medical Officer, providing information on the recommendations from global health organizations and the Japanese health ministry regarding covid-19. Some are anxious about the spread of the virus, but the captain hopes that this will address each concern anyone might have.  He states that keeping everyone informed is one of their top priorities.  We still have barges helping us perform essential marine operations, and there is no need to go out to sea for the time being. We will stay docked to daikoku pier in Yokohama until further notice. The captain has been receiving a good amount of letters - he is pulling three quotes from these daily, and sharing with the crew.  He reminds us that the health and well-being of everyone aboard is their top priority. We were assured that everything was being done to bring this trying time to an end. Six days to go, whoop! 20:30 Got dinner! Today, the food situation was much a bit better. We liked both of our dinners compared to other meals, and we even got KIT KATS! We got some other Japanese snacks as well, such as (we think) fried/baked noodles! It‚Äôs nice to be able to try new types of snacks even while confined.

I suffered a mild stroke while masturbating and had to call 911. First responders and several family members saw my "setup" and I'm still struggling with how to deal with the embarrassment of it all. AMA
So just so I can relate I‚Äôll tell you of the accident that showed ‚Äúmy setup‚Äù to my family... parents grandparents and all accompanied family members.  Let me set the scene... Family reunion, volley ball in the back yard with my hefty female cousin. She hit the ball over the fence into the neighbors garden and I was convinced by my uncle I should jump and retrieve it as he figured she could not. I jumped off the top of this fence and landed on a 1/2 inch piece of steel stock that they must have been using as a truss. Entered through my scrotum and came out 30cm above ‚Äúmy setup‚Äù. I proceeded to pull myself off it in a fit of shock and jump back over the fence. The fence ripped me of my dignity and my pants were torn from my body completely.  There I am bleeding from the groin and my whole family (20+people)  shocked staring at my setup.  I was rushed to the hospital. Turns out the steel stock pushed everything vital out of the way and only damaged tissue.  Happened a few years ago, it‚Äôs gets better OP.  Just the occasional shishkabob joke now. TL;DR got impaled through the scrotum, 20+ family members saw my dick and balls covered in blood.

You‚Äôre a kinky guy! Own it! Might as well be ‚Äòout‚Äô about whatever it is you‚Äôre into. Have fun with it. Let THEM be embarrassed. Invite THEM to be as open minded as you. And then thank them for saving your life and loving you. EDIT: I realized this is an AMA so I‚Äôll add a couple questions to my unsolicited advice: How many sex toys did you have out anyway?  Have you considered writing a self-love ‚Äòhow-to‚Äô book?  
Two butt plugs, one largish realistic looking black dildo ( not sure why the color matters, but it probably does to someone involved here). Couple different lubes, nipple pumps (they probably have no idea what those are) and an Aneros.  This was all wrapped up in a towel and placed in my room by either my mother or my sister.   The smaller of the two butt plugs is "missing."  I have several theories.   1) it was in me when I called 911 and they have a protocol of not "returning" such a thing. 2) I did something with it in a panic and I'll end up finding it in a drawer the next time I move or 3) my freaky sister took it.   I know that last one sounds crazy, but it's like a 1% idea and would not completely surprise me.  
so obviously if you know your sister is so freaky she mght take a fucking used butt plug from you, really how embarrassed should you feel?  I'm not going to say I wouldn't be mortified in your situation but everyone is a freak deep down. Just remember the ones who would give you shit about it prob have some crazy shit locked in their own closets  
This is simple.  Yes my sister is freaky and I would not put that past her, but , as you suggest, taking someone's used butt plug from then while they are in the ER getting treated for a stroke is really fucking weird and I don't actually think she did...just that I think it's possible.  Not really something I want to accuse her of.  Plus, if I ever stole someone's used butt plug, I would deny it to the very end even if they confronted me...so I won't get it back regardless, and it would likely not bring about any goodness.  
Two butt plugs, one largish realistic looking black dildo ( not sure why the color matters, but it probably does to someone involved here). Couple different lubes, nipple pumps (they probably have no idea what those are) and an Aneros.  This was all wrapped up in a towel and placed in my room by either my mother or my sister.   The smaller of the two butt plugs is "missing."

From an EMS worker and works in the ED (emergency department), I first off want to thank you for calling 911 ... many ppl wait too long before calling, especially with stokes. Secondly, I‚Äôm glad it was a TIA and you made a full recovery. Thirdly, pls be aware that this can happen again and make sure to make follow up appointments with you PCP and specialist with neurologist to make any lifestyle modifications to reduce future risks of TIA and then stroke. To acknowledge suspicion 1) EMS has the butt plug.  we want nothing to do with what is up your arse ;) flattering though.   EMS would probably not remove the butt plug. If this happened, I would imagine it was in the ED.  We would always inform and talk to our patients privately about any matter and return the person‚Äôs property. That being said, some things can be lost in an emergency situation. But these tend to be smaller items. Socks, shoe, ring.  Most of the time we cut off clothes and you were already naked. We put all personal belongings in a bag and list out all items.  That all being addressed.... Do you have known high blood pressure or cholesterol issues? And as a follow up.... Were you at the time of the TIA using the butt plug? If you can‚Äôt remember specifically, I understand. TIA‚Äôs can affect some short term memory. Family wise: Are they religious, show any kind of discrimination issues against fetishes, etc?   
Yes, religious in a generic Catholic way.  Yes discriminatory in the usual religion driven sort of way....Jesus hates masturbation, and if we're supposed to avoid menstruating women, we certainly should avoid men who are shoving things in and out of their ass and moaning to themselves.     I'm still learning what is "typical" with these TIAs, but I do have a pretty substantial blur all leading up to the event.   It's less that I've completely forgotten stuff, but more that the timestamps all got erased and randomized...Like it's not a linear narrative.      Regarding the butt plug: It's the small one that's missing, which is usually the first thing in, and I had moved onto the deep plunging and eye-rolling part of the session, so pretty sure it was laying on the towel, but we may never know, I suppose.  I do not have high blood pressure and have low cholesterol - high HDL.

After you bust a nut, don‚Äôt you look around and think that it all seems so silly? Like, ‚Äúwhy the hell do I have all this stuff‚Äù, or ‚Äúnow I need to clean all this mess‚Äù.  I mean... ‚Äúdifferent lubes‚Äù? How many does one person need at a time? TWO butt plugs AND a dildo? I am hesitant to even ask why three devices are needed at once.  
So, the butt plugs are different sizes...one goes in pretty easily without much thought/buildup.  I then dildo myself for a while.   Sometimes I can hands-free orgasm from that, but usually, I'll work in the larger plug and then manually masturbate which feels great.   The two lubes are simple.   I use J-Lube for things that go in the ass, and Silicone based Gun Oil or Swiss Navy (basically the same thing) for my hand/penis.    But yes, I do experience a fairly predictable post-cum depression as I can't just nod off and go to sleep, but have to clean up all the gear.  Always feels pretty stupid.   Sometimes, I'll stop mid session, clean and tidy everything other than what I have decided I really want for my final fun, and then there is less to deal with post-ejac.   I'm always glad I did that.   Plus, I am often high while doing all this, which makes all the custodial stuff even more difficult and undesirable.

I don‚Äôt own any devices, but I do smoke marijuana. I would compare owning multiple sextoys, to the way a pot smoker might buy multiple pipes. Like, don‚Äôt you just need the one? Anyway I roll my weed, so I don‚Äôt own any of those toys either. I‚Äôm boring as hell!

Oh man Aneros looks like fun but my girlfriend would never let me buy one that expensive. Is it worth the money? Seems like I'm paying out of the part I want to stuff it in just for the branding. Is it overrated at all? As for a genuine question, do you share your hobbies with your girlfriend at all?  
totally worth the money if you have the time and patience.   It's a mental challenge to relax and let the sensation build without corrupting thoughts.   I liken it to meditation.

Probably one of those storys you see on reddit. *Im a paramedic AMA*. Anyways that aside, glad you're ok. better that your well now than them finding you unconscious or dead in your living room naked with all your toys laying around.   
Well, better for them.   I would not have known the difference.   Not that I at all wish that had been the outcome. But it did make me think about the other things I might have that people would discover if I did die suddenly.     
 the other things I might have that people would discover if I did die suddenly.  You havent made a sex toy pact? You have one person, best friend, SOMEONE, who you're like. "Look, if I ever die, or something happens to me.... There's this box....( Or draw, or closet if you're a  Miranda aayyooo). Don't look in it, just throw it out" And likewise, you do the same for them. And that is how you delete your shame from the world and ensure your parents don't find your butt dildo while sobbing and cleaning out your things.

We‚Äôve seen worse. Once got called to ‚Äúan attempted suicide via bleed out‚Äù I‚Äôm hauling ass because I‚Äôm thinking slit wrists. Nope dude cut his dick off.   
OOO that reminds me. We got a call for a "hemorrhage" last winter. No other information. Dude was bangin his pull out couch, some wire or metal from this ragged and ripped couch caught him, left a nasty gash on his bald headed yogurt slinger. Walk in with our bags, poor dude sitting next to his freshly lubed (now with blood) bang hole, stark naked as the day he was born, power grasping his junk with a towel. That was an interesting narrative.   
"Bald headed yogurt slinger" is now going to be worked into my conversations, thank you

Dude, my first question is why do you not have a porn buddy?  
Yeah, so I have sort of automated my pornbuddy.   I keep all my porn in .sparsebundle encrypted disk images.   I use AppleScript and Automator to force eject all my sensitive drives (some porn, some financial, some just criminally damning stuff) upon 1 hour of inactivity.   I generally remember to eject them myself when "done." but in the event of a stroke or something, I should be covered in that regard. It's fairly robust.  I guess I need a dildo buddy or something.

What's a porn buddy?  
A porn buddy is someone who you trust taht when you die (or have a stroke) goes to your house and is responsible with deleting all your porn and clean up your sex toys or pull the dildo out of your ass so family doesn't see that.

Oh, yeah...sorry.   32, M, straight.   Live-in girlfriend of 6 years who was thankfully out of town on travel.   She knows I had the TIA and went to the ER, but I think that's all.   She is good friends with my youngest sister (not the one who was at my house) so she could know something, but we're pretty open, so I think she would have said something.   I do intend to tell her, but it's just been a lot.  
I don't mean any offence by this because I don't masturbate too much myself but, if you're straight why do you use dildos?   
Yeah, I like stuff in my ass.  The GF is ok with it 'sometimes' and not to the same extent a I would like.   She does the finger thing pretty much all the time, and has fucked me with "her" dildo quite a bit, which I like...but I really get off from extended slow fucking with the dildo and that usually means I'm doing it alone.   She knows I'm into "butt stuff" however not to the extent of being so organized about it.

You're really young to have a TIA, did they found out a cause ? I would let the embaressement go if I were you, first responders didn't care about any of it and I'm sure your family is just happy you're ok. They were probably too worried about you to care about the rest.   
This is very true. First responders deal with weird shit all the time, things much worse than this. Its pretty much part of the job description. Source: have a friend that's an EMT

Did anyone lowkey teaze you about it? What kinda things did they say?  
I think I would actually like it better if they WERE teasing me.   They are just saying enough to let me know they know, but not really getting anything out in the open.  Mom just said "I wrapped your things up in a towel and put them in your room." and Dad saying things like, "I thought [girlfriend] was out of town."  etc

If it makes you feel any better, as an EMT you see many people masturbating. Most of them aren't having actual medical problems, and get super creepy. So they've seen it a hundred times, and were probably just relieved you weren't calling to try to harass them.   
Like, hey, let's call 911 and be jerking off when they arrive?   That's a thing?

Thank you.   Glad it made you laugh..I was hoping at least the world could share my pain with some giggling at least.

How often do you see your family? Do they have keys to your house or know where your spare is hidden? Reading this made me realize how much my family would want to be there for me if I had an emergency like this and how they wouldn‚Äôt be able to because they don‚Äôt have a key and I don‚Äôt keep a spare outside.  The embarrassment I am sure is scorching, but you need to move past it. They are your family and will love you no matter what. Write your parents a thank you note for all they did to take care of you. It‚Äôs a classic and classy move. You don‚Äôt need to discuss your personal pleasure preferences if it makes you or them uncomfortable; that‚Äôs a very private part of your life that they don‚Äôt participate in or need to accept or know about. They may be shocked, but if you give it time and send the thank you note, I am confident things will go back to normal. Wishing you the best!!!

Did you have any symptoms leading up to the stroke?   
Zero symptoms...No high blood pressure or anything.    ‚Äã  
My ex had a TIA a couple of years after we met. There were no symptoms, and the situation was sort of similar- it happened about 10 minutes after we had sex.   
Man...now im worried. I was getting a blowjob once and when I came I suddenly had the most excruciating headache. And I never get headaches.

Who gives a shit? You survived a stroke!! Live your life! Be stoked you survived that stroke. I would celebrate! I would wank it again, except this time you can give yourself ‚Äúthe stranger‚Äù with your numb hand.

How old are you? What was going through your head while you were waiting for the first responders?  
Once the crazy symptoms started, time was kind of a non-entity.  I don't recall any waiting.  It was like pressing the last 1 in 9-1-1 made them magically appear at my door.  I remember calling, but don't remember any conversation and given what the paramedics said about my condition when they found me, I suspect it was just nonsense.  All I was thinking was that I was actively dying from something.  
On a scale of 1-10, how badly were you freaking out at the idea of dying?

Former paramedic here: Fire/rescue sees crazy shit all the time.  I once had a woman stuck between the toilet and the tub. She had been using a suction cup dildo on the edge of the tub and slipped. She was wedged in there tight, and we had to take the toilet apart to get her out. One of my first calls as a BLS provider was a 14 year old kid with his dick stuck in the intake hole of a hot tub.  The valve wasn‚Äôt that big, so I have no idea how he got his dick in there to begin with.  The squad had to come and cut a big hole around the valve, and we transported him with that hunk of hot tub stuck to his willie, which had swollen up into a purple ball. The worst part was that his mother was a VERY stereotypical Brooklyn Jewish mother, and she was losing her whole shit the entire time. I once had to chemically restrain a guy whose girlfriend put him in one of those little dick cages and went to work. They were into BDSM, and he was her slave. I don‚Äôt quite understand what happened, but apparently he got an erection, and was in excruciating pain. His girlfriend had the key to the thing. I basically just snowed him under with versed and haldol, and took him to the hospital. There was a guy who showed up at one of our local ED‚Äôs who lived 5 hours away. He had 4 apples lodged in his rectum, and had been to just about every hospital between our ED and his home, and didn‚Äôt want to go to the same hospital (or one in the same group) with the same problem. I have transported numerous men with vibrators lodged past the second sphincter. They all had to have them removed surgically. The surgeon opens the abdomen, takes the intestine in his hands, and kind of squeezes it like a pastry bag until the vibrator shoots out and rattles around on the floor.  So don‚Äôt feel bad. This happens all the time. Your family might look at you sideways for a while, but dollars to donuts, they have their own ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù quirks/kinks, too. Live your life, friend. I hope you feel better.

Don‚Äôt worry so much. That‚Äôs probably what they are thinking (straight men don‚Äôt do butt stuff, cheating on gf, etc.), but again, that‚Äôs a very private and intimate part of your life. They don‚Äôt need to know anymore details and it doesn‚Äôt sound like you would be comfortable giving them a more in-depth explanation of what was going on.   A thank you note, while it won‚Äôt address the elephant in the room, will help start the healing process. You are still their son who they love very much and they will always worry about you so long as they have breath in their bodies; it‚Äôs part of being a parent. They just want you to be okay above everything else. Breathe: time will heal this and make it less uncomfortable. Put on a brave face and they will likely take their cue from you and just put it out of their minds.  You could apologize to your mom for any discomfort seeing those things may have caused her and assure your dad that you‚Äôre not cheating on your gf and that all of it is just part of a personal hobby and that they don‚Äôt need to worry. That could invite unwanted questions though.  Maybe you could talk to your girlfriend (in detail) about it. She may have the best advice to give since she knows you and your family so well. Your romantic life and habits are the business of very few people; you, your partner(s), your doctor, and  maybe your therapist. I think if anyone would be able to guide you in the right direction, it would be her.  I‚Äôve had to confess some truly cringe worthy things to my husband and he‚Äôs confided similarly uncomfortable things to me and we‚Äôve been able to help each other through those difficult situations. That‚Äôs why you have a partner; life is better with two. You and your partner have committed to being there for each other when things get difficult even if you haven‚Äôt made vows and exchanged rings and all that. I would go into more detail about my own personal stuff but my friends know I post with this account and they don‚Äôt need to know all the nitty gritty details.  TL;DR Thank you notes help even if they don‚Äôt address uncomfortable situations directly. Ask your SO for advice since she knows you and your parents and may be able to help you better than anyone else.

This is an easy one: own it. You're the only one that can make yourself feel any way about it. You have to choose shame, so don't. You said it best yourself, 'self love'. It's that simple. No one can shame you but yourself, and there's nothing wrong with what you were doing. The end.  To paraphrase the lovely Julia Child, NEVER APOLOGIZE. Do not twist yourself into knots of excuses and explanations.  Show yourself a little love and move on. And enjoy self care Sundays with gusto! Good vibes ;)  Edit: Gold! Wowserz! Thanks!

I feel like I have to buy all new toys regardless.   There's something just not-cum inducing about the following thought:  "Hey, this is the dildo I was fucking myself with on the day I had that stroke and I traumatized my family."   Plus, someone DM'd me and offered to buy the dildo for $100 postage paid, I shit you not.

Do you know what caused it?  
A TIA is essentially a warning stroke, or a more mild version of a stroke. It is a wake up call that you need to make some changes etc. Like others said it is caused by elevated blood pressure, blood clots, etc. Biggest risk factors are poor nutrition, smoking, and little excercise.  
Do you know what caused it?  
A TIA is pretty much a stoke, it just goes away by itself. So I would say it was elevated blood pressure from masturbating caused a blood clot to enter part of the brain.

What if you have a small "world tour of friends"? Do small little individual visits of all your friends?  I do have a few questions, 1) What is your favorite food to eat? 2) Favorite way to spend time alone? 3) Favorite way to spend time with others?  
I've been video chatting with every one.   I love Chinese takeout. And ice cream. And chocolate.  I love reading a book in the bathtub but don't like to be along much now.  Having a cup of tea and a cookie and just chatting.   
Chinese takeout is the best! I sadly don't have many great options near me. What is your favorite dish? I love reading as well! I love the older sci-fi books like Ender's Game, Starship Troopers, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. I also enjoy a lot of fantasy book series as well that is a massive list. What would be a book (or series) you have read that you would recommend to me I am a huge chocolate fiend as well and I expect the cookies to be some kind of chocolate üç´  
I love honey walnut chicken, steamed dumplings and vegetable lomein with a side of garlic broccoli.  I love the Misborn series by Brandon Sanderson or the Stormlight archive by the same author.

What are you dying from? Is there no treatments? Does your family know you are dying? Whats your opinion on death and afterlife?  
I have acute myeloid leukemia. I haven't responded well to treatment. Yes, my family knows. I'm hoping there's an afterlife so I can experience more. I wish I wasn't dying.  
You mentioned food! What is your absolute favorite meal?  I am teaching myself to cook so I love to try new things. 50 years old and still learning. Right now I am trying to learn Indian curries. I went there and fell in love with paneer cheese. Its tough to find here in Qu√©bec but I am determined. I am also trying to master lentils. Its hit or miss. Like tofu I'm not sure sometimes if I like it. I'll make a special meal to celebrate food and your life.  
Completely off topic but you can make your own paneer using milk and lemon juice. Loads of recipes online.

Like tofu I'm not sure sometimes if I like it. I'll make a special meal to celebrate food and your life.

I recently read a book on near death experiences. Everyone who died and was brought back to life described it as extremely peaceful, and no longer feared death. The book is called "Lessons from the light".  Not sure if this helps but thought it would be a unique insight.  
Lessons from the Light What We Can Learn from the Near-Death Experience by Kenneth Ring, Evelyn Elsaesser Valarino  This relaunch of a popular title by Ring (considered by many to be the Dean of Near Death Experience Researchers) includes a new foreword by Caroline Myss. Lessons from the Light extracts the pure gold of the Near Death Experience (NDE) and with a beautiful balance of rigorous research and human insight reveals the practical wisdom held within these experiences. "Unquestionably the most important book on the subject of near-death experience since Moody's Life After Life." - Ian Wilson, author of The After Death Experience  I'm a bot, built by your friendly reddit developers at /r/ProgrammingPals.

how is your boyfriend handling the thought of your death?  
It's been hard of course. He's a couple years older than me and out of college. He is going to be with me at the end. He's able to take the time off of his job. He promised he'd be there holding my hand.

Why did you have to cancel it? Any chance that you could postpone it if you live long enough? How do you plan to spend the time you have left? Can I give you a hug?  
Covid. I don't think things will be better while I have good quality of life. I'm at home with my family for now just trying to talk to every one.

Could you possibly still have your party and just request that people who come quarantine for 2 weeks prior?? I bet people would do that for you. If it were someone I love and it was the last time I knew I would see them, I would definitely complete secluded myself for them.  
You might, and I believe most of the OP's friends would have the good intentions to do it, but all it takes is one person who slips up even a little bit and then OP either has to deal with covid on top of everything else in her last days, or the guilt of someone having caught covid at her party. It sucks and it's so so hard, but I really respect that OP is staying safe for her own/her friends' sake even at this time in her life.

I'm so sorry you're going through this. Life just isn't fair sometimes.  What are you most sad about never getting to experience?  
I really wanted to get married and have kids.  
You could get married in the time you have left. Get yourself to Vegas and hire Elvis?  
And if they want a kid, they can adopt me! I‚Äôm 28 years old, but I can act super childish sometimes so it will be a similar experience

Hey Theresa, what's your favorite movie?  
Ummm. I really like a big range of movies. I like the Hunger Games Trilogy and the books too. I like Star Wars and The Devil Wears Prada and Ever After.  
You should watch two movies before you go: #1. Harvey (1950) and #2. Harold and Maude. Best of luck to you!

I don't have any Questions for you, but perhaps a bit of comfort for a topic a lot of people fear. Two weeks after I turned 25yo, I suffered from a Grand Mal Seizure out of nowhere during a nap I took after work. I died for roughly 3-4 minutes. I foamed at the mouth, everything in my body stopped, I turned blue. I was lucky enough to come back to life with CPR and a paramedic, but the feeling of death never left me. So let me tell you how it is. Death is peaceful. It doesn't hurt at all.  For me, I didn't feel the dying aspect of my seizure since I was already asleep when it started, I just felt the death and coming back to life feelings. So I can't give you much info on how that trip will be for you as you go. But I can tell you that crossing over to death has no pain. It's more like when a person becomes hypothermic but feels warm, Like a cocoon.  It is not violent, it's just like going to sleep in the softest, fluffiest, pillow.  I know this doesn't alter your fate, and I know a lot of people fear death.. but when the time comes, I hope this information brings you some form of comfort. You'll be safe when you cross over...  Life will take care of everything else on this side. üíìüíîüíì

Not trying to sound like a butthole or anything dying young sounds sucky but have you thought about how you won‚Äôt have to deal with anything anymore no bills no rent you won‚Äôt have to worry about what other people think of you what people say about you, you don‚Äôt have to worry about how you have to find a mind numbing career to be normalized in today‚Äôs society I feel like that would be a big weight lifted off your shoulders I know you‚Äôd rather prefer to experience stuff like that but me personally I do not look forward to having to buy a house having to find a partner having kids all that stuff I don‚Äôt want any of that tbh how do you feel knowing you don‚Äôt have to deal with that?

Not really a question, but if you can spare a minute I want you to watch this scene from Lord of the Rings.  https://youtu.be/PbLKjO2ImGo  Just be aware of the horrible (and loud) editing at 1:06. Here's the text for you: PIPPIN: I didn't think it would end this way. GANDALF: End? No, the journey doesn't end here. Death is just another path, one that we all must take. The grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass, and then you see it. PIPPIN: What? Gandalf? See what? GANDALF: White shores, and beyond, a far green country under a swift sunrise. PIPPIN: Well, that isn't so bad. GANDALF: No. No, it isn't.  
This is amazing dude.

You're dying and have come to accept this, and I'm sorry about that. However, you say you "had to" (not "chose to") cancel your funeral. Why are you willing to have others congregate for you and risk their lives and potentially their families with what is going on in the world right now?

Do you have the mentality of a seven year old or like an 19 year old  
No I have a mentality of a 19 year old like I know who I am and everything about me,  when my ‚Äúfamily‚Äù came in started asking me a bunch of questions like (are you ok?) (how are you doing?) I was kind of confused and asked the doctor if my grandma was around or if she‚Äôs coming to get me out of here so he told me to explain when I did everyone was confused when I told them my grandma dropped me of at a bakery store a while ago, only my twin brother realized and explained to them then told me that happened when we were 7 and my grandma had passed away 2 years ago.

I don‚Äôt recognize faces, but if I hear a voice I get a weird sensation that I‚Äôve heard the voice before but I don‚Äôt know where

Last thing you remember and how is your memory now!  
Last thing I remember was when I was 7 and my grandma dropped me off at a bakery to buy cupcakes, I can‚Äôt really judge my memory now ‚Äòcause I just got out of surgery 5 days ago  
Oh dayum, so this is recent! So, another question if you don‚Äôt mind: What are some tips to help someone with memory loss?  
Uhh I guess prepare yourself for the worst lol and just be ready for anything you‚Äôll be told. You can ask as many questions I don‚Äôt mind

Are you able to continue going to university since you have just had knowledge like 7 years old boy?  
Not op, but with amnesia you remember everything you‚Äôve learned. Your brain store‚Äôs information and knowledge in a separate part of the brain than that of memories. They actually did a study a while ago with someone who has anterograde amnesia (which means the person can‚Äôt make any more memories and their memory resets every so often in a pattern) and the person was given a maze to complete. Each time he took it they‚Äôd ask if he has completed the maze before, obviously he doesn‚Äôt remember and says no. Each time he completed the maze he got faster and better at it until he could complete it in a few seconds. He doesn‚Äôt have the memories of the maze, but the knowledge of what to do is still there.

Did you remember Reddit or did you just discover it after your surgery?  
No I had it installed on my phone and my boyfriend helped me make an account and post about my story here and answer questions to help pass time till he comes back and visits after his college classes I just got out of surgery 5 days ago if that make things more clear

Is it complete amnesia, or more of a dissociated type of amnesia?  
That I‚Äôm not sure of or any of my doctors I‚Äôm getting tested in 2 weeks because I just got out of surgery 5 days ago and I can barely move a muscle  
I see, guess to rephrase my sentence, is your memory foggy but that you can sort of remember? or is it like it never happened, and you are hearing of a story about yourself?  
It‚Äôs like nothing ever happened, and I‚Äôm hearing a story about myself I guess? I‚Äôm not sure if that answers your question, sorry English isn‚Äôt my first language

Seems Reddit should keep it's day job and give up on the whole cyber detective thing. Enjoy your 15 minutes of Reddit fame, bro.   
What's really disturbing is a number of Trump-supporting commentators with a huge following just ran with it, reporting it as news on Twitter and elsewhere. I think a couple conservative websites even ran articles assuming that this guy was the shooter. Now who is "fake news?"

Why were you released so early, isn't 1st degree murder usually punished by life in prison? Also what happened to your relationship with your girlfriend and other people in your life? Other than killing the 73 year old is there any other effects that you regret?  
I‚Äôm not American. Different system where I am. I am still with my girlfriend now, most of my friends are guys I served with and we are still in contact. I regret the time I lost and I regret making such a mess. I believe the male I killed deserved it, I simply wish I‚Äôd killed him in a manner that hadn‚Äôt uprooted my life and lead to another man‚Äôs death. Not that his death was anyone‚Äôs fault but my own. I pulled the trigger, I have to own that.  
I was successfully tried and convicted for the murder of two people. AMA.
How much time was there between the incident with the 31 year old man and his father? Were you just waiting around for someone else to show up, or did he show up there immediately after?  Also, What‚Äôs it like spending so much time in prison?  
I killed the 31 year old male within a minute, I sort of took it in before shooting his body. It was only a few seconds after I started shooting until the man turned up. All I saw was his gun so I killed him. Boring, very boring. Lonely at times too. World goes on and you‚Äôre stuck. I‚Äôm not saying I deserved better but the prison system is broken, 99% of the guys in there, petty crooks or serious criminals, come out worse than when they went in.

What do you do now? Have you had trouble finding employment? What does your family/friends think? How old are you now?  
Bike mechanic. Yes and no, never going to be able to get a regular job but there are programmes in place that help people like me. Most of my friends served with me and don‚Äôt judge me for what happened. I don‚Äôt have any biological family. I‚Äôm in my 30s.

Did you get any leniency based on the circumstances? Did you explain the nature of your motive in court?  
I was certainly treated better due to my service and certain actions I took during my service. Along with the fact my emotions were heightened due to what happened. However the latter isn‚Äôt a valid excuse. I knew exactly what I was doing and would gladly kill that male again. I wouldn‚Äôt say I enjoyed it but people like him need to be removed and I don‚Äôt regret removing him.

 Are you sorry for what you did? About those others murders... you said one was solved but what about the others? Why did they accuse you and did you do it?   
I regret killing the 73 year old man. He was trying to defend his child and he wasn‚Äôt responsible. I don‚Äôt regret killing the 31 year old male and I would do it all over again if I had a time machine. He deserved it.  
Sorry, just realised you never addressed my second question. Can you please?  
Sorry, forgot to address that. No, I didn‚Äôt kill them. I‚Äôm not a naturally violent person and would never randomly kill someone. What happened was a result of me wanting to get revenge and then getting caught up in the moment and firing without cause. I believe they linked me to the case because I was within the general area and they were also firearms related incidents. However I genuinely did not commit those crimes. I wouldn‚Äôt kill someone without reason, it‚Äôs illogical.

You're incredibly lucky... You had malicious intent (stalked the guy), broke into his house, beat the man to a pulp (your words in other comments), you were trained to kill (army training) then shot him repeatedly.. Then killed another man who was defending themselves from you. The fact that you even got out of jail is unreal to me. Have you met anyone in jail who's had a far worse sentence for something far less violent?  How do you cope with the guilt of shooting the old man? I'd imagine there has been lots of therapy involved. I'm just reading these comments, I'm honestly speechless. Like what if somebody sets you off, what's stopping you from killing again? You're obviously not a stranger to it.  
I regret killing the 73 year old man. He was trying to defend his child and he wasn‚Äôt responsible. I don‚Äôt regret killing the 31 year old male and I would do it all over again if I had a time machine. He deserved it.  
The fact that you don't regret it, is fucked to be honest. I know you'll never see it this way, but it's just not your call to make who deserves to live or die. It doesn't matter what they've done. You need help

I love watching movies based on revenge stories, but the movies never seem to capture what happens to the person afterwards. It makes me think about RDR2 and the theme of revenge being an empty persuit. Did you feel vindicated at all, or did it do more harm then good to you as a person?

How was prison?  
First one was easy, posh, naive guards and lots of wannabe kids posing as gangsters. Second one was a bit rougher but I fitted in easily enough. Only ever had one fight and the other guy came out very badly. I had no other issues with people. Loneliness sucked though.

Not a question but an observation.  You come across as someone very in control of themselves and your answers are polite and dignified almost. And it sounds like life is good and I hope and pray it continues to improve and your gf gets better. Actually, I do have a question. Why are you doing an AMA? I'm finding it incredibly informative, so thank you. But what are your motivations?  
Thank you. Yes, I‚Äôd say I am. I don‚Äôt really get set off anymore and all these responses, good or bad, are justified.  Honestly, I‚Äôm not sure. I guess I just thought it would be interesting for both me and people on here to do one where I answer honestly. It‚Äôs not a common perspective.  Motivations for the AMA?

Do you ever struggle with the idea that you may be a bad person for what you did? How do you feel about yourself after everything?  
I know I am a bad person. In my life I‚Äôve killed 9 people. (7 were in combat and legal) I felt bad for two. I know what I am and I live with it, I don‚Äôt really feel much in the way of emotion anymore. I am what I am, these days I just want to live with what I have and not be bothered by anything dramatic ever again.  
Obviously you feel bad about the old guy, but you mentioned that you felt bad for two out of nine deaths. Who was the second?  
I killed a child. He was rigging an IED right near us, I yelled at him and told him to fuck off, we gave him a chance cause he was a kid. He stared at us and then started rummaging about in his pockets so I shot him. We searched him after and he had a glock and a dead cat‚Äôs head on him. He was a weird kid but still a kid, I wish I didn‚Äôt have to do that. I don‚Äôt blame him. I blame the animals who taught him what he did was the right thing to do.

Agree with you there. If the court system handled it, 31guy would get 3 hots and a cot for a few years then get released to go ruin someone else's life. In a different comment, op mentioned how someone reported their attacker and got killed later, I don't think op wanted that possibility. Not saying murder is okay for every crime but I can't really blame op for popping 31guy. Not so much about 73guy though.

First and foremost I am sorry what happen to your partner and the pregnancy. No words for that. Please don‚Äôt feel you have to answer these questions. But I will pose them anyway as I am curious.  What are you able to discuss in regard to the rape and beating? Why were your partner and this person in the same place? What triggered the violent attack? Do you ever worry that something may have been going on between them? You will never get the other side of the story. Also, could you partner be scared of what you may do to her, if the truth, if any, was revealed? Just my curiosity. With little details provided these questions arose in my head. Again, not saying your partner, who was the victim of a horrendous attack had any part in what took place.

What was the legal process after your "red handed" arrest?  Did you plead guilty, did a lawyer negotiate a deal, or did you put together a defence and try to get off (or any other options in your country)?  
I was successfully tried and convicted for the murder of two people. AMA.
How are you adjusting to regular life? For all it's worth, thank you for your service. That's a crazy situation.  
I was successfully tried and convicted for the murder of two people. AMA.
You don‚Äôt have to answer these questions, but I'm genuinely curious and without judgement: I read in your comments that you deliberately decided "this person needs to be erased". While not many people go through what you did (hopefully!), I assume not all of them resort to killing. Even when they don‚Äôt trust law enforcement. What made you feel so strongly that he had to die and you were going to make sure he did? Do you think serving made it "easier" to decide someone's fate/right to live? Did you ever think about the possibility of some easing circumstances in his life? (I‚Äôm not at all agreeing with what he did! I‚Äôm a sexual assault survivor myself. I‚Äôm genuinely curious how you feel, since I tend to be too empathetic and forgiving sometimes) Thank you!

What did your girlfriend think of what you did?  
There was so much change over those months neither of us really processed it properly. We are still together now but it‚Äôs something we don‚Äôt discuss too deeply. Too much pain, for her especially.  
Do you ever worry that she may be afraid of you? How would you feel if she ever wanted to leave you, or if she cheated on you or something like that?

When you came out of prison and back into the "real world" did some new thing sursprise you?  
Phones were better, motorbikes were easier to ride, people were basically the same. No real surprises though, we got TV in there and I spoke to my girlfriend for a few hours every day.  
That makes sense, you seem like a good guy I honestly wishe you were able to kill that 31 year old bastard who murdered your child in a way that would have left the old guy alive. But no use to cry over spilled milked, I wish you and your girlfriend years of happines. And thanks for the quick response.

I read in another one of your responses that your girlfriend was sorry the old man died- but was she happy that her rapist was killed?  What does her family think of what you did? When the 31 year old shat himself, did you smell it or see it first?  How far along was she when she lost the baby? By the way, no need to answer any of these questions if they make you feel uncomfortable. Thanks for taking the time to write this.  
Her dad is glad I did it, her mother was horrified but felt sorry for me and let it go.  Heard it, didn‚Äôt smell or see it. I did see his muscles relax though and heard gas release so it was obvious. 5 months 3 weeks and 3 days.  
I‚Äôm so sorry for your/you girlfriend‚Äôs loss, and the many years you lost. Is this the first time you‚Äôve used Reddit? Are you worried that what you write here could be used against you? (In the US we have double jeopardy laws protecting people from being tried twice for the same thing, but I‚Äôm not sure how it is there) What do you think of shooters and victory Royale games like Call of Duty, Fortnite, etc? Are they silly to you since you‚Äôve actually killed people, or are they still fun? Do you think the murder and ensuing sentence ruined your life? Do you consider yourself a happy person? Are you able to enjoy things?  Was there financial difficulty for your girlfriend? Was she able to get therapy or other help? Does she have lasting health problems from what happened?

What are your thoughts on how you handled/what you did to the male that hurt your girlfriend?  Would you of  done things differently? How does your girlfriend feel about it?  
It was unnecessarily messy. I didn‚Äôt need to kill his father and I shouldn‚Äôt have stormed into his house guns blazing. In hindsight I would have killed him in a manner that would have resulted in me not being caught. Would have saved everyone a lot of stress. I‚Äôd have killed him regardless though, he didn‚Äôt deserve to live. She, like me, hates that an innocent old man died and she obviously didn‚Äôt like that I was gone for years but we are in a good place now.

Are you ok? Is your wife better?  
I‚Äôm actually okay. She‚Äôs still affected and can be a little clingy, to the point of always needing to be around me, I understand it given everything, she‚Äôs going to start therapy soon as I don‚Äôt want her to try and build her identify entirely off me. It was a tough conversation to have but I think it‚Äôs healthy, she needs to be her own person outside of us.  
It must be a complicated situation. I wish you and your wife some better days and I hope the will pay. She'll still need your protection. Be here for her even tho she indeed needs to be able to be alone without getting terrified. This is a very sad story.

What other actions could you or would you have taken versus breaking into his house and killing him?  
Probably would have killed him with carbon monoxide or dissolved his body and buried his teeth etc under the grave of a dog or something. That way when sniffer dogs roll around they‚Äôll dig up the dogs grave and the police will move on thinking that‚Äôs all there was to find. You‚Äôd be surprised how easy it is to get away with murder if you just use your brain. I didn‚Äôt.

She didn‚Äôt talk to the police because the police are useless with this sort of thing. The last person in our area who told the police who raped her was then beaten to death by her rapist.

I am an old grandmother that absolutely LOVES talking to you kiddos. AMA about what it‚Äôs like to be an old lady on the internet. I also have good recipes.
I didnt have any grandparents growing up, and as someone who is deeply interested in history ive always wished I could sit down and have a cup of tea with my grandma and listen to all her life stories! Would you like to join me for some virtual tea and cake and tell me your favourite memory from when you were my age? (f22)  
Let‚Äôs see. 22. Oh my sweet child. Lol  When I was 22 I was literally a vagabond. I decided that I should spend some time adventuring, so that‚Äôs what I did. It wasn‚Äôt a popular decision at the time, but who the hell is going to stop me from doing it? Not a soul. So, I would pick up work in a town, which was enough to get me to another town and on it went.  I met the most amazing people during that time. Artists and musicians and diner owners and farmer‚Äôs wives. I really went out there and did it.  And I learned to be cold and hungry and self sufficient and happy. Lovely days those were. ‚ù§Ô∏è  
I can't imagine being able to just pick up work in a town, you know? I'm 29. It takes me 2-3 months to find a job on the internet.  
I know. Those were back in the days when you could just walk into a business and ask if they had any work. It so frustrating that so many people in my generation don‚Äôt understand how drastically different it is now before they start judging...

Hi grandma! I'm living in a foreign country now and suddenly came down with a terrible case of exhaustion a few months ago which put me in a wheelchair. I'm looking for some recipes for comfort food to eat when you're feeling sick and/or feeling blue. Have any good ones?  My husband is a great cook, so it doesn't have to be something I  personally (who can't stand in front of a stove) can make!  
I‚Äôm sorry to hear that, baby. The best comfort food of all time is homemade baked Mac and Cheese. I‚Äôd send you a link but it‚Äôs fairly straight forward with Mr. Google. Add more cheese. Gooey. Warm. Delightful.  Wishing you well, sweetie.  
Would you mind sending me the link too? Homemade Mac and Cheese is my number one favourite comfort food. I already have a great recipe but I'm always excited to try new ones :)

You're adorable.  I have 2 questions.  I love someone to death and she is my best friend. Her highschool is total shit and I am effraid she feels really down. She is the kind of person to not want to put her friends into her problems (english isn't my mane language so it might not be very cleaver) but I really want to do my best if I can help her. Do you have any idea? Other question: Do you have any recipe of chocolate and peach cake? I like recipes. (Without any robots except an electric egg mixer because I don't have any robots or machines to make food)  
If you‚Äôre just starting to bake cakes, literally use the Betty Crocker cookbook. They‚Äôre all online now, and they‚Äôre really self explanatory. You can make them all without any fancy equipment. As far as your friend goes, my only advice is all you can do. Just be there. Just be there to listen if she wants to talk, and let her know that you care.  
Thank you grandmother! I'll check this book out.  And I will try to be here for her as much as I can! It makes me feel like I'm not doing enough but maybe it is...  
Hey, you're absolutely doing enough. I've been on both sides of that situation, needing help and giving it. Without fail, the person in trouble needs someone who cares about them, someone who loves them dearly, someone who can pick them up whenever they fall down, even just someone to talk to. The fact that you're here asking how to help makes me think that you are that person, and that you can help. Take care of your friend, ok? Edit: forgot to mention this, but you said your friend doesn't like involving others in her problems, right? I would suggest not to ask them how you can help, because then they'll most likely refuse the help. Just do whatever you can, and if they ever try to refuse you can say that you're helping because you want to help. If your friend ends up asking for help, what could happen is they think they're forcing you to help them, which is why I'm saying to skip the asking them how you can help, and just skip straight to the helping, in whatever way that may be that you can help.

Ok so im not a teenager but im interested in your recipes. üòÄWhat is your favourite recipe?  
My favorite recipe is for strawberry cobbler. It‚Äôs my favorite recipe because you get to just mix common ingredients in a bowl, and throw some strawberries on top of that shit and boom. 45 minutes later you have a desert that you‚Äôd be proud to take anywhere. It‚Äôs my favorite cheat. best cheat ever

I can never get custard right, either never thickens up or turns into scrambled eggs. Can you help me? Edit: I did it! Using a double boiler and cream instead of milk made an amazing smooth custard! Thank you everyone for your great tips!  
Gonna weigh in here as a pastry chef, there's two primary types of egg based custard that immediately come to mind: cr√®me anglaise and cr√®me patissiere. Creme anglaise is thickened only with the protein and fat from the egg yolk and is actually meant to be sorta thin, like a melted icecream sorta sauce. Creme patissiere has either flour or starch added to the egg yolks and sets firm, much like pudding. The process people are talking about here is called tempering your eggs, and will prevent the scramble! I cook my custard in a pot over low flame. Hope this helps!

Are you using a double boiler? That‚Äôs the trick. Slow, steady, indirect heat while you gradually add components while you whisk like your life depends on it.‚ù§Ô∏è  
Thank you, wise grandma. I soon will have great custard

Not OP, but add a little bit of the hot milk mixture into the eggs in stages while whisking constantly to temper them before adding to the pot.  Should stop scrambling.  
Tried that, thats how I get a mixture that won't thicken :/

Houses become homes if you give them some love.  You live in a house, but you build a home. My favorite place in the world is Glacier Park in Montana.  I was born and raised in the vast nothingness and everything that is the mountains of Montana. 5 out of 5, would reincarnate.

Funny, I was just missing my own grandmother (she lives halfway across the world). What is something that brings you joy?  
Flowers. Birds. Poetry. Music. Just lovely little things. My stupid, stupid but lovable animals. I swear to god if I ever had a smart animal the Universe would implode.  
Haha aw. Also, dogs or cats? If so, favorite breed?  
All of the animals. Just...all of them. I‚Äôve had goats, chickens, pigs, rabbits, snakes, you name it, I had it. And I guarantee you it was adorable and dumb as a stone. I seem to attract those

What's your favourite type of music (or artist)? I'm 22 but I absolutely love the old rock from the 50s.  
I‚Äôve always liked rock the best. Zeppelin was a big favorite. But then I got a whole new set of artists in the 90s that I really liked. I‚Äôm lucky to have good kids that turned me onto Nirvana and the Pixies as they knew I might like it. Love me some Pixies...

What advice would you give to an teenager?  
Just remind yourself that it‚Äôs okay. Everyday and everything seems like an insurmountable obstacle at some times. It‚Äôs not.  Don‚Äôt forget that you‚Äôre a part of a lovely world. Find beauty in the little things.  
I saved this comment for future reference. I had a really crappy day today but reading this literally reinvigorated me on the spot almost.

What's the most interesting technological advancement you have seen?  
Cell phones. By far.  I‚Äôve always enjoyed computers and coding, but if you had told me back in 1980 that I would have this processing power while sitting on my porch, I would have thought you were bananas. Like, we should probably call a professional level of bananas...  
That's really cool! I'm only fifteen years old, is there anything I should know that you wish you had known at fifteen?  
Just remember for all of life‚Äôs frustrations, there is literally beauty all around you. I bet you could find something pretty around you right now. It might be a color you really like, or a smell, or the way the light is shining through your window.  Just always find the beauty.

What was the most memorable historical event in your  life?  
Sadly, 9/11.  It was terribly surreal, and I think most everyone knows where they were when it happened. I wish it was something more jovially cool. Like where I was when first I watched Bob Ross...

This might be weird, but I lost my grandmother last year and I really miss hanging out with someone older. I used to volunteer at the old folks home in my hometown but now that I‚Äôm in college I find it a little difficult. I would really like to hang out with the elderly man next door but I don‚Äôt know how to go about it without being weird. Any advice?

My stupid dog ran into a beetle in the kitchen.  My dog is enormous. Think small horse sized. Lol. So, she ran into this beetle and had NO idea what to do.

But this is the deal breaker? A damned beetle?‚Äù

Hi! As a teen who loves cooking, what recipe would you recommend for me to make for my entire family?  
Hi! Not OP but as another young adult who likes cooking, I recommend roast beef, jambalaya, or sushi. Theyre all relatively easy and I find people are always very appreciative of them. They're my go-to for impressing relatives haha. That being said, try new things every chance you get! I recently got a spiralizer and wanted to use it to make something, but I wasn't wanting pasta, so I just spiralized potatoes and dumped them in a pan to fry. They ended up being DELICIOUS. I've found that being a little free with recipes tends to lead to better results, I came up with my jambalaya recipe by following a pinterest recipe but changing a few spices and ingredients.

Well, you should follow his eye movements more than his hand movements which will help you predict where he‚Äôs gonna work next and you can stay one step ahead, it takes a while but once you get it it‚Äôs easy.

woah I never knew Americans had a different name for torches. I mean where I‚Äôm from we used both so I figured  
We call them flashlights. Because they aren‚Äôt actual torches, as in they aren‚Äôt burning pieces of tree giving off huge flames and smoke.  
We call them torches. Because they don't actually flash, as in they don't give out brief pulses of light by discharging a high voltage through a partially-evacuated tube with some xenon gas in it.

I successfully canceled an LA Fitness Membership over the phone
I'm gonna need you to talk me through the whole timeline of this, your majesty.  
So this saga started on Wednesday. I called at my lunch hour around 1:45PM EST and asked to cancel my membership, the receptionist told me only the Operations Manager can cancel memberships and she is on lunch. I asked when she would be back, and was told 2:30PM. I called back at 2:45PM and was told she was still at her lunch. I called one final time on Wednesday at 4PM and was told by a different receptionist the same line of "Only an Operations Manager can cancel memberships and she is on lunch." I left a message with her and waited for a call.   At 3PM on Thursday I called once again and was told the same line. (Call 4) Me: "That is fine, I will hold until she gets back." Receptionist 1 (R1): "Are you sure? It might be a while." Me: "Yep I will wait." --- 5 Minutes Later--- Operations Manager (N): "Hi this is Naomi, how can I help you?" Me: "Hi Naomi, I would like to cancel my membership." N: ‚ÄúWe only cancel membership in person between the hours of 10AM and 3PM, Monday through Friday.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt going to work for me Naomi, I work.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúWell you can send in a form, but that can take weeks to process.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúNo, you are not charging me for extra time, we are going to cancel this now.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI cannot do that.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù N: ‚ÄúBecause we cannot verify who you are over the phone.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúBut you can through mail?‚Äù N hangs up.   I immediately call back. (Call 5) R1: ‚ÄúHi, this is LA Fitness, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúPlease redirect me to Naomi, thank you.‚Äù --- Hold for 10 minutes --- N: ‚ÄúThis is Naomi, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi Naomi, it seems like our call dropped, this is BabstheBeagle again. I would like to cancel my membership.‚Äù   -  Side Note: I know the call didn‚Äôt drop, I just have worked in customer service before and know that a nice person is more likely to get their way. N: ‚ÄúAs I said, we only do that through person or through the mail, I will not be able to help you today.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúYes you will Naomi, I will continue calling until you are able to. I know you can.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI was trained in December and that will not be happening.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúYes it will be, I do not care who you have to call to make this happen.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI will not be canceling this membership over the phone.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúThen we will be..‚Äù Boop, N hangs up again Me: ‚Äúspeaking a lot today.‚Äù     Call 6 R1: ‚ÄúHi this is..‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúTransfer me to Naomi.‚Äù Boop, R1 hangs up.     Call 7 ‚Äì 10 The receptionist never answered my call, they just put me on hold. I work in an open office space so all my coworkers have heard me trying to cancel this membership at this point. I borrow a coworker‚Äôs phone and call back. (Call 11) R1: ‚ÄúHi, this is LA Fitness, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi, can I speak to the Operations Manager?‚Äù R1: ‚ÄúSure! Let me transfer you.‚Äù --- Naomi almost immediately answers --- N: ‚ÄúThis is Naomi, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi Naomi, this is BabstheBeagle again.‚Äù Boop, N hangs up.   This is where I start to have fun. I borrow multiple coworkers phones, calling back and asking for Naomi. After 4 more calls, they eventually get me to Naomi. At this point it is around 4:50PM. (Call 12) N: ‚ÄúHi BabstheBeagle, you know I cannot cancel this.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúNaomi, you must know that I will not stop calling until you do. Why again can‚Äôt you cancel this over the phone?‚Äù N: ‚ÄúBecause I cannot verify who you are.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúI will shoot you a text with my fingerprints, face, nostrils, I will even buy you plastic surgery so you cancel this for me.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI cannot.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúPlease transfer me to your manager.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI already spoke to him, I am not allowed to cancel this.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúI do not care if you spoke to him, transfer me now.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI will not be doing that. Have a nice day.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúNAOMI DO NOT HANG UP ON ME.‚Äù Boop, she is gone again.    Call 13 ‚Äì 15 they keep on ignoring me.    Call 16 ‚Äì 5:01PM Receptionist 2 (R2): ‚ÄúHi, this is LA Fitness, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúI am just trying to cancel my membership.‚Äù R2: ‚ÄúWell we are unable to do that, only the operations manager can and she just left for the day.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúI do not care, I will continue to call until you find someone that can cancel this membership.‚Äù R2: ‚ÄúI am here until 10:30PM, talk to you soon.‚Äù Boop, hung up on again.    There is a funny thing about LA Fitness call system. When they put you on hold a message pops up saying ‚ÄúThank you for calling LA Fitness, your call means a lot to us, we will answer you shortly.‚Äù Every time I heard ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù I hung up and called again. This was purely to make sure that their phone was constantly ringing. This happened for call 17 ‚Äì 24.   Call 25 Ross (GM): ‚ÄúHi BabstheBeagle this is Ross, you have been told that we can‚Äôt cancel your membership unless the Operations Manager does it. She is no longer here. I am the General Manager and I can‚Äôt even do it.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi Ross, I have talked to your Operations Manager multiple times, I will continue calling tonight unless you cancel this membership. If you can‚Äôt do it, find someone who can.‚Äù GM: ‚ÄúGive me a minute.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúSure Ross.‚Äù --- Hold for a minute or two --- GM: ‚ÄúAlright BabstheBeagle, this is the number of another location. The OM named Caleb is expecting your call and he will cancel your membership.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúThank you Ross, you are clearly the only one there with brain cells.‚Äù GM: ‚ÄúHave a good one.‚Äù   Call 26 Receptionist 3 (R3): ‚ÄúHi, this is LA Fitness, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi, I am calling for Caleb, he is expecting my call.‚Äù R3: ‚ÄúYep, he is just with a client right now, please hold for a minute.‚Äù --- Hold for a bit --- Caleb (C): ‚ÄúHi BabstheBeagle, how can I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi Caleb, you have to cancel my membership.‚Äù C: ‚ÄúHave to?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúDo you know how I got to you?‚Äù C: ‚ÄúYes, you wouldn‚Äôt stop calling.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúWhat makes you think that will change just cause you tell me no.‚Äù --- Long Pause --- C: ‚ÄúAlright, let me verify some information and I will cancel this for you.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúYou are a saint among ding dongs.‚Äù   Caleb proceeded to unhappily cancel my membership. This call ended at approximately 5:30PM.  I did not curse once, but I think every employee at LA Fitness hates me now and I couldn‚Äôt care less.    Also sorry if this is horrible to read. I am a sucky writer and honestly have no intention of getting better. Edit: Formatting for easier reading  
 ‚ÄúThank you Ross, you are clearly the only one there with brain cells.‚Äù  Worked at LA Fitness for a year.  The one's with brain cells are the ones that turn over and find a new job the quickest.  
Clearly! My coworker used to work there and she said they definitely could cancel it over the phone.

I was once being harassed by a gym to update my information. They were reaching out to me to ask me to pay some annual membership fee. I told them I hadn't been to the gym in a year and wasn't going to. They said that the fee was still required. I asked them if they had my credit card information. They said no, and I said "Good bye" and hung up.  
SiruisXM got that treatment from me. When I was on the fence about renewing, I changed the saved card info to one of those virtual card numbers you can get from your bank that's only good for a month. I called up a few weeks before the subscription ran out and told them to cancel it when the current sub ran out.  Almost as soon as the sub ran out, they called me asking for payment info. I told them "no thanks" and hung up on them.  
So this saga started on Wednesday. I called at my lunch hour around 1:45PM EST and asked to cancel my membership, the receptionist told me only the Operations Manager can cancel memberships and she is on lunch. I asked when she would be back, and was told 2:30PM. I called back at 2:45PM and was told she was still at her lunch. I called one final time on Wednesday at 4PM and was told by a different receptionist the same line of "Only an Operations Manager can cancel memberships and she is on lunch." I left a message with her and waited for a call.   At 3PM on Thursday I called once again and was told the same line. (Call 4) Me: "That is fine, I will hold until she gets back." Receptionist 1 (R1): "Are you sure? It might be a while." Me: "Yep I will wait." --- 5 Minutes Later--- Operations Manager (N): "Hi this is Naomi, how can I help you?" Me: "Hi Naomi, I would like to cancel my membership." N: ‚ÄúWe only cancel membership in person between the hours of 10AM and 3PM, Monday through Friday.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt going to work for me Naomi, I work.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúWell you can send in a form, but that can take weeks to process.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúNo, you are not charging me for extra time, we are going to cancel this now.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI cannot do that.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù N: ‚ÄúBecause we cannot verify who you are over the phone.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúBut you can through mail?‚Äù N hangs up.   I immediately call back. (Call 5) R1: ‚ÄúHi, this is LA Fitness, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúPlease redirect me to Naomi, thank you.‚Äù --- Hold for 10 minutes --- N: ‚ÄúThis is Naomi, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi Naomi, it seems like our call dropped, this is BabstheBeagle again. I would like to cancel my membership.‚Äù   -  Side Note: I know the call didn‚Äôt drop, I just have worked in customer service before and know that a nice person is more likely to get their way. N: ‚ÄúAs I said, we only do that through person or through the mail, I will not be able to help you today.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúYes you will Naomi, I will continue calling until you are able to. I know you can.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI was trained in December and that will not be happening.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúYes it will be, I do not care who you have to call to make this happen.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI will not be canceling this membership over the phone.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúThen we will be..‚Äù Boop, N hangs up again Me: ‚Äúspeaking a lot today.‚Äù     Call 6 R1: ‚ÄúHi this is..‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúTransfer me to Naomi.‚Äù Boop, R1 hangs up.     Call 7 ‚Äì 10 The receptionist never answered my call, they just put me on hold. I work in an open office space so all my coworkers have heard me trying to cancel this membership at this point. I borrow a coworker‚Äôs phone and call back. (Call 11) R1: ‚ÄúHi, this is LA Fitness, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi, can I speak to the Operations Manager?‚Äù R1: ‚ÄúSure! Let me transfer you.‚Äù --- Naomi almost immediately answers --- N: ‚ÄúThis is Naomi, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi Naomi, this is BabstheBeagle again.‚Äù Boop, N hangs up.   This is where I start to have fun. I borrow multiple coworkers phones, calling back and asking for Naomi. After 4 more calls, they eventually get me to Naomi. At this point it is around 4:50PM. (Call 12) N: ‚ÄúHi BabstheBeagle, you know I cannot cancel this.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúNaomi, you must know that I will not stop calling until you do. Why again can‚Äôt you cancel this over the phone?‚Äù N: ‚ÄúBecause I cannot verify who you are.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúI will shoot you a text with my fingerprints, face, nostrils, I will even buy you plastic surgery so you cancel this for me.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI cannot.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúPlease transfer me to your manager.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI already spoke to him, I am not allowed to cancel this.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúI do not care if you spoke to him, transfer me now.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI will not be doing that. Have a nice day.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúNAOMI DO NOT HANG UP ON ME.‚Äù Boop, she is gone again.    Call 13 ‚Äì 15 they keep on ignoring me.    Call 16 ‚Äì 5:01PM Receptionist 2 (R2): ‚ÄúHi, this is LA Fitness, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúI am just trying to cancel my membership.‚Äù R2: ‚ÄúWell we are unable to do that, only the operations manager can and she just left for the day.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúI do not care, I will continue to call until you find someone that can cancel this membership.‚Äù R2: ‚ÄúI am here until 10:30PM, talk to you soon.‚Äù Boop, hung up on again.    There is a funny thing about LA Fitness call system. When they put you on hold a message pops up saying ‚ÄúThank you for calling LA Fitness, your call means a lot to us, we will answer you shortly.‚Äù Every time I heard ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù I hung up and called again. This was purely to make sure that their phone was constantly ringing. This happened for call 17 ‚Äì 24.   Call 25 Ross (GM): ‚ÄúHi BabstheBeagle this is Ross, you have been told that we can‚Äôt cancel your membership unless the Operations Manager does it. She is no longer here. I am the General Manager and I can‚Äôt even do it.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi Ross, I have talked to your Operations Manager multiple times, I will continue calling tonight unless you cancel this membership. If you can‚Äôt do it, find someone who can.‚Äù GM: ‚ÄúGive me a minute.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúSure Ross.‚Äù --- Hold for a minute or two --- GM: ‚ÄúAlright BabstheBeagle, this is the number of another location. The OM named Caleb is expecting your call and he will cancel your membership.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúThank you Ross, you are clearly the only one there with brain cells.‚Äù GM: ‚ÄúHave a good one.‚Äù   Call 26 Receptionist 3 (R3): ‚ÄúHi, this is LA Fitness, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi, I am calling for Caleb, he is expecting my call.‚Äù R3: ‚ÄúYep, he is just with a client right now, please hold for a minute.‚Äù --- Hold for a bit --- Caleb (C): ‚ÄúHi BabstheBeagle, how can I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi Caleb, you have to cancel my membership.‚Äù C: ‚ÄúHave to?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúDo you know how I got to you?‚Äù C: ‚ÄúYes, you wouldn‚Äôt stop calling.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúWhat makes you think that will change just cause you tell me no.‚Äù --- Long Pause --- C: ‚ÄúAlright, let me verify some information and I will cancel this for you.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúYou are a saint among ding dongs.‚Äù   Caleb proceeded to unhappily cancel my membership. This call ended at approximately 5:30PM.  I did not curse once, but I think every employee at LA Fitness hates me now and I couldn‚Äôt care less.    Also sorry if this is horrible to read. I am a sucky writer and honestly have no intention of getting better. Edit: Formatting for easier reading  
 Also sorry if this is horrible to read. I am a sucky writer and honestly have no intention of getting better.  A sucky writer??? Not a chance, this entire story was riveting from start to finish, and I honestly laughed out loud a number of times.

You should call them back and tell them you changed your mind. Let's see how much verification they need for that.  
So my friend wants to call them up and say "Hi I am BabstheBeagle, some one cancelled my account without my authorization."  I thought that was pretty funny.

Reminds me of the story of the guy trying to cancel his planet fitness membership and they threatened to call the cops if he didn't stop calling. After the cops got on the phone he got his membership cancelled.  
I was waiting for that to happen but we didn't get there.

For what its worth, neither my girlfriend or I had any issues with just sending in the cancellation form. Just send it certified mail (costs a couple bucks at the post office) so they can't claim they never got it. For both my girlfriend and I, our memberships were cancelled within a week of sending the form, didn't get charged anything extra.   
I shouldn't have to pay to cancel a membership though! That is ridiculous.  
So this saga started on Wednesday. I called at my lunch hour around 1:45PM EST and asked to cancel my membership, the receptionist told me only the Operations Manager can cancel memberships and she is on lunch. I asked when she would be back, and was told 2:30PM. I called back at 2:45PM and was told she was still at her lunch. I called one final time on Wednesday at 4PM and was told by a different receptionist the same line of "Only an Operations Manager can cancel memberships and she is on lunch." I left a message with her and waited for a call.   At 3PM on Thursday I called once again and was told the same line. (Call 4) Me: "That is fine, I will hold until she gets back." Receptionist 1 (R1): "Are you sure? It might be a while." Me: "Yep I will wait." --- 5 Minutes Later--- Operations Manager (N): "Hi this is Naomi, how can I help you?" Me: "Hi Naomi, I would like to cancel my membership."

I asked when she would be back, and was told 2:30PM. I called back at 2:45PM and was told she was still at her lunch. I called one final time on Wednesday at 4PM and was told by a different receptionist the same line of "Only an Operations Manager can cancel memberships and she is on lunch." I left a message with her and waited for a call.   At 3PM on Thursday I called once again and was told the same line. (Call 4) Me: "That is fine, I will hold until she gets back." Receptionist 1 (R1): "Are you sure? It might be a while." Me: "Yep I will wait." --- 5 Minutes Later--- Operations Manager (N): "Hi this is Naomi, how can I help you?" Me: "Hi Naomi, I would like to cancel my membership." N: ‚ÄúWe only cancel membership in person between the hours of 10AM and 3PM, Monday through Friday.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt going to work for me Naomi, I work.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúWell you can send in a form, but that can take weeks to process.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúNo, you are not charging me for extra time, we are going to cancel this now.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI cannot do that.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù N: ‚ÄúBecause we cannot verify who you are over the phone.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúBut you can through mail?‚Äù N hangs up.   I immediately call back. (Call 5) R1: ‚ÄúHi, this is LA Fitness, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúPlease redirect me to Naomi, thank you.‚Äù --- Hold for 10 minutes --- N: ‚ÄúThis is Naomi, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi Naomi, it seems like our call dropped, this is BabstheBeagle again. I would like to cancel my membership.‚Äù   -  Side Note: I know the call didn‚Äôt drop, I just have worked in customer service before and know that a nice person is more likely to get their way. N: ‚ÄúAs I said, we only do that through person or through the mail, I will not be able to help you today.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúYes you will Naomi, I will continue calling until you are able to. I know you can.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI was trained in December and that will not be happening.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúYes it will be, I do not care who you have to call to make this happen.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI will not be canceling this membership over the phone.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúThen we will be..‚Äù Boop, N hangs up again Me: ‚Äúspeaking a lot today.‚Äù     Call 6 R1: ‚ÄúHi this is..‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúTransfer me to Naomi.‚Äù Boop, R1 hangs up.     Call 7 ‚Äì 10 The receptionist never answered my call, they just put me on hold. I work in an open office space so all my coworkers have heard me trying to cancel this membership at this point. I borrow a coworker‚Äôs phone and call back. (Call 11) R1: ‚ÄúHi, this is LA Fitness, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi, can I speak to the Operations Manager?‚Äù R1: ‚ÄúSure! Let me transfer you.‚Äù --- Naomi almost immediately answers --- N: ‚ÄúThis is Naomi, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi Naomi, this is BabstheBeagle again.‚Äù Boop, N hangs up.   This is where I start to have fun. I borrow multiple coworkers phones, calling back and asking for Naomi. After 4 more calls, they eventually get me to Naomi. At this point it is around 4:50PM. (Call 12) N: ‚ÄúHi BabstheBeagle, you know I cannot cancel this.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúNaomi, you must know that I will not stop calling until you do. Why again can‚Äôt you cancel this over the phone?‚Äù N: ‚ÄúBecause I cannot verify who you are.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúI will shoot you a text with my fingerprints, face, nostrils, I will even buy you plastic surgery so you cancel this for me.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI cannot.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúPlease transfer me to your manager.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI already spoke to him, I am not allowed to cancel this.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúI do not care if you spoke to him, transfer me now.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI will not be doing that. Have a nice day.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúNAOMI DO NOT HANG UP ON ME.‚Äù Boop, she is gone again.    Call 13 ‚Äì 15 they keep on ignoring me.

There is a funny thing about LA Fitness call system. When they put you on hold a message pops up saying ‚ÄúThank you for calling LA Fitness, your call means a lot to us, we will answer you shortly.‚Äù Every time I heard ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù I hung up and called again. This was purely to make sure that their phone was constantly ringing. This happened for call 17 ‚Äì 24.   Call 25 Ross (GM): ‚ÄúHi BabstheBeagle this is Ross, you have been told that we can‚Äôt cancel your membership unless the Operations Manager does it. She is no longer here. I am the General Manager and I can‚Äôt even do it.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi Ross, I have talked to your Operations Manager multiple times, I will continue calling tonight unless you cancel this membership.

This call ended at approximately 5:30PM.  I did not curse once, but I think every employee at LA Fitness hates me now and I couldn‚Äôt care less.    Also sorry if this is horrible to read. I am a sucky writer and honestly have no intention of getting better. Edit: Formatting for easier reading

So this saga started on Wednesday.

I asked when she would be back, and was told 2:30PM. I called back at 2:45PM and was told she was still at her lunch. I called one final time on Wednesday at 4PM and was told by a different receptionist the same line of "Only an Operations Manager can cancel memberships and she is on lunch." I left a message with her and waited for a call.   At 3PM on Thursday I called once again and was told the same line. (Call 4) Me: "That is fine, I will hold until she gets back." Receptionist 1 (R1): "Are you sure? It might be a while." Me: "Yep I will wait." --- 5 Minutes Later--- Operations Manager (N): "Hi this is Naomi, how can I help you?"

So this saga started on Wednesday. I called at my lunch hour around 1:45PM EST and asked to cancel my membership, the receptionist told me only the Operations Manager can cancel memberships and she is on lunch. I asked when she would be back, and was told 2:30PM. I called back at 2:45PM and was told she was still at her lunch. I called one final time on Wednesday at 4PM and was told by a different receptionist the same line of "Only an Operations Manager can cancel memberships and she is on lunch." I left a message with her and waited for a call.   At 3PM on Thursday I called once again and was told the same line. (Call 4) Me: "That is fine, I will hold until she gets back." Receptionist 1 (R1): "Are you sure? It might be a while." Me: "Yep I will wait." --- 5 Minutes Later--- Operations Manager (N): "Hi this is Naomi, how can I help you?" Me: "Hi Naomi, I would like to cancel my membership." N: ‚ÄúWe only cancel membership in person between the hours of 10AM and 3PM, Monday through Friday.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt going to work for me Naomi, I work.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúWell you can send in a form, but that can take weeks to process.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúNo, you are not charging me for extra time, we are going to cancel this now.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI cannot do that.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù N: ‚ÄúBecause we cannot verify who you are over the phone.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúBut you can through mail?‚Äù N hangs up.   I immediately call back. (Call 5) R1: ‚ÄúHi, this is LA Fitness, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúPlease redirect me to Naomi, thank you.‚Äù --- Hold for 10 minutes --- N: ‚ÄúThis is Naomi, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi Naomi, it seems like our call dropped, this is BabstheBeagle again. I would like to cancel my membership.‚Äù   -  Side Note: I know the call didn‚Äôt drop, I just have worked in customer service before and know that a nice person is more likely to get their way. N: ‚ÄúAs I said, we only do that through person or through the mail, I will not be able to help you today.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúYes you will Naomi, I will continue calling until you are able to. I know you can.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI was trained in December and that will not be happening.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúYes it will be, I do not care who you have to call to make this happen.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI will not be canceling this membership over the phone.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúThen we will be..‚Äù Boop, N hangs up again Me: ‚Äúspeaking a lot today.‚Äù     Call 6 R1: ‚ÄúHi this is..‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúTransfer me to Naomi.‚Äù Boop, R1 hangs up.     Call 7 ‚Äì 10 The receptionist never answered my call, they just put me on hold. I work in an open office space so all my coworkers have heard me trying to cancel this membership at this point. I borrow a coworker‚Äôs phone and call back. (Call 11) R1: ‚ÄúHi, this is LA Fitness, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi, can I speak to the Operations Manager?‚Äù R1: ‚ÄúSure!

This is where I start to have fun. I borrow multiple coworkers phones, calling back and asking for Naomi. After 4 more calls, they eventually get me to Naomi. At this point it is around 4:50PM. (Call 12) N: ‚ÄúHi BabstheBeagle, you know I cannot cancel this.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúNaomi, you must know that I will not stop calling until you do. Why again can‚Äôt you cancel this over the phone?‚Äù N: ‚ÄúBecause I cannot verify who you are.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúI will shoot you a text with my fingerprints, face, nostrils, I will even buy you plastic surgery so you cancel this for me.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI cannot.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúPlease transfer me to your manager.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI already spoke to him, I am not allowed to cancel this.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúI do not care if you spoke to him, transfer me now.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI will not be doing that.

This brings back memories of trying to cancel my 24-hour fitness membership.  I went into the place on my lunch since it was near my work. Like you they said it had to be done by a manager, which they called over. When he got to the desk he asked the person I was talking to what the issue was. When they told the manager that I was looking to cancel membership the manager just shook his head no at them, never once acknowledged my presence, and walked away. The front desk lady gave me an 800 number to call.  Of course I was on hold for an hour. At the time I worked a retention line for a customer service team so I knew the game that was about to be played and spent the time on hold developing a plan.  CSR: Hello, how can I help you today? Me: Yes I need to cancel my membership. I tried to do it at the location but they said I had to call this number.  Verify some information to pull up the account.  CSR: now before I continue I have to enter your cancel reason.  Me: I have diabetes and in two months both my lower legs and one of my hand will be amputated. I will be going through an rehab program and I will not longer be able to use the equipment available at your gyms. Short but noticeable pause CSR: Are you sure you will no longer be needing your membership.  Me: Yes. CSR: Ok, I will get that cancelled for you now.  Of course I think this is over, but was I ever wrong.  I went on with life not giving it another though, until a month later when I got charged again. I went back into the local gym and they verified there was a note to cancel my account added on the date I called. So the lady at the front desk, the same one I had originally talked to, said that she would clear it up but was not allowed to refund the last payment. I was like whatever, I just want it over.  And again, the next month, boom I get hit with a charge.  It took several more calls and going into the local gym while having the same conversation before it was finally done.  I WILL NEVER EVER JOIN A GYM OR SUGGEST TO ANYONE THAT THEY JOIN A GYM. Every now an then 24 hour fitness will come to the office to try to sign people up with a discount. Every time they do I go to my HR department and tell them my story that I am very upset they are allowed to swindle others. A few times that has ended up with them being asked to leave.   
The simplest solution is to dispute the charge with the credit card company. They go back to the company charging you and make them prove they have the right to continue the charges. If the same thing happens with the same companies over and over, the CC companies will stop processing any payments to the gym.

So this saga started on Wednesday.

I asked when she would be back, and was told 2:30PM. I called back at 2:45PM and was told she was still at her lunch. I called one final time on Wednesday at 4PM and was told by a different receptionist the same line of "Only an Operations Manager can cancel memberships and she is on lunch." I left a message with her and waited for a call.   At 3PM on Thursday I called once again and was told the same line. (Call 4) Me: "That is fine, I will hold until she gets back."

What's amusing is they're so eager to sign you up over the phone. I went to an LA fitness with my sister a few weeks ago and they WON'T STOP CALLING.  So--good for you. This story made me laugh.

I got rid of an investment bank calling every two weeks by swiftly unlearning how to language. As long they are only wasting your time they will keep at it. When they feel it's their own on the other hand...

Gyms are hilarious when trying to get your business, trying to play on your vanity and flirt with you to sign up.

So this saga started on Wednesday. I called at my lunch hour around 1:45PM EST and asked to cancel my membership, the receptionist told me only the Operations Manager can cancel memberships and she is on lunch. I asked when she would be back, and was told 2:30PM. I called back at 2:45PM and was told she was still at her lunch. I called one final time on Wednesday at 4PM and was told by a different receptionist the same line of "Only an Operations Manager can cancel memberships and she is on lunch." I left a message with her and waited for a call.   At 3PM on Thursday I called once again and was told the same line. (Call 4) Me: "That is fine, I will hold until she gets back." Receptionist 1 (R1): "Are you sure? It might be a while." Me: "Yep I will wait." --- 5 Minutes Later--- Operations Manager (N): "Hi this is Naomi, how can I help you?"

So this saga started on Wednesday.

I asked when she would be back, and was told 2:30PM. I called back at 2:45PM and was told she was still at her lunch. I called one final time on Wednesday at 4PM and was told by a different receptionist the same line of "Only an Operations Manager can cancel memberships and she is on lunch." I left a message with her and waited for a call.   At 3PM on Thursday I called once again and was told the same line. (Call 4) Me: "That is fine, I will hold until she gets back."

Why again can‚Äôt you cancel this over the phone?‚Äù N: ‚ÄúBecause I cannot verify who you are.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúI will shoot you a text with my fingerprints, face, nostrils, I will even buy you plastic surgery so you cancel this for me.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI cannot.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúPlease transfer me to your manager.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI already spoke to him, I am not allowed to cancel this.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúI do not care if you spoke to him, transfer me now.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI will not be doing that.

There is a funny thing about LA Fitness call system. When they put you on hold a message pops up saying ‚ÄúThank you for calling LA Fitness, your call means a lot to us, we will answer you shortly.‚Äù Every time I heard ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù I hung up and called again.

So this saga started on Wednesday. I called at my lunch hour around 1:45PM EST and asked to cancel my membership, the receptionist told me only the Operations Manager can cancel memberships and she is on lunch. I asked when she would be back, and was told 2:30PM. I called back at 2:45PM and was told she was still at her lunch. I called one final time on Wednesday at 4PM and was told by a different receptionist the same line of "Only an Operations Manager can cancel memberships and she is on lunch." I left a message with her and waited for a call.   At 3PM on Thursday I called once again and was told the same line. (Call 4) Me: "That is fine, I will hold until she gets back." Receptionist 1 (R1): "Are you sure? It might be a while." Me: "Yep I will wait." --- 5 Minutes Later--- Operations Manager (N): "Hi this is Naomi, how can I help you?" Me: "Hi Naomi, I would like to cancel my membership." N: ‚ÄúWe only cancel membership in person between the hours of 10AM and 3PM, Monday through Friday.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt going to work for me Naomi, I work.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúWell you can send in a form, but that can take weeks to process.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúNo, you are not charging me for extra time, we are going to cancel this now.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI cannot do that.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù N: ‚ÄúBecause we cannot verify who you are over the phone.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúBut you can through mail?‚Äù N hangs up.   I immediately call back. (Call 5) R1: ‚ÄúHi, this is LA Fitness, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúPlease redirect me to Naomi, thank you.‚Äù --- Hold for 10 minutes --- N: ‚ÄúThis is Naomi, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi Naomi, it seems like our call dropped, this is BabstheBeagle again. I would like to cancel my membership.‚Äù   -  Side Note: I know the call didn‚Äôt drop, I just have worked in customer service before and know that a nice person is more likely to get their way. N: ‚ÄúAs I said, we only do that through person or through the mail, I will not be able to help you today.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúYes you will Naomi, I will continue calling until you are able to. I know you can.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI was trained in December and that will not be happening.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúYes it will be, I do not care who you have to call to make this happen.‚Äù N: ‚ÄúI will not be canceling this membership over the phone.‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúThen we will be..‚Äù Boop, N hangs up again Me: ‚Äúspeaking a lot today.‚Äù     Call 6 R1: ‚ÄúHi this is..‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúTransfer me to Naomi.‚Äù Boop, R1 hangs up.     Call 7 ‚Äì 10 The receptionist never answered my call, they just put me on hold. I work in an open office space so all my coworkers have heard me trying to cancel this membership at this point. I borrow a coworker‚Äôs phone and call back. (Call 11) R1: ‚ÄúHi, this is LA Fitness, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi, can I speak to the Operations Manager?‚Äù R1: ‚ÄúSure! Let me transfer you.‚Äù --- Naomi almost immediately answers --- N: ‚ÄúThis is Naomi, how may I help you?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúHi Naomi, this is BabstheBeagle again.‚Äù Boop, N hangs up.   This is where I start to have fun. I borrow multiple coworkers phones, calling back and asking for Naomi. After 4 more calls, they eventually get me to Naomi. At this point it is around 4:50PM.

I successfully canceled an LA Fitness Membership over the phone
Don't want to hijack your AMA, but I want to pop in and just say, FUCK LA Fitness. I took them up on their offer for a free 1 on 1 with a personal trainer. I knew they were going to try and rope me into signing up for it, but what I didn't expect was how aggressive they would be about it. It was frankly disgusting. I went to see what sort of routine one expects with a personal trainer and wanted to see what it was like. At the end of the experience, I told them I needed to go home and think about it, and they went batshit insane. They did everything in their power to keep me from leaving. They spent over 2 hours trying to talk me into it ("Why do you need to think about it? What is there to think about?" over and over and over); the manager pretended to call a "higher up" to get me a "better deal", which he faked SO badly. He tried to tell me that my girlfriend might leave me if I don't get in slightly better shape, and when that didn't work, he started to argue that eventually I might die from health problems ("No doubt in my mind you're probably pre-diabetic", despite the fact that my doctor said otherwise and I'm not even that obese...) and he literally, I shit you not, began to say, repeatedly, "I'm trying to save your life" and started to conjure up scenarios in which I was dead and how it would make my family feel. (edit: For the sake of clarity, the dude saying that was the manager on duty trying to sell me on the trainer's service, not the personal trainer himself. The personal trainer was, at worst, complicit with his boss's shady tactics, and while also a douche, was not overtly offensive like he was.)  That's when I was like holy FUCK I have to get out of here now. As soon as he walked away to help another customer for a moment I fucking bolted out of the gym.  When I came back two weeks later to cancel my membership - on the final day that I could before the next month started - they refused to cancel it. It was, of course, the same fucker as before; He told me they couldn't cancel it after 5 PM because no one there had permissions to do so. This is probably the first and only time that I lost my fucking shit. I went off on the dude, how he is full of total shit, how this is a fucking scam, etc. And this fucker decides to get mouthy right back at me. On the fucking job. He starts cussing back at me, dropping F-bombs, and at one point, he grabbed a box of donuts and sarcastically was like "You want one? You look like you could use it." So yeah. Didn't get to cancel until the next day at which point they charged me for the next month anyway, but the GM there who listened to my tirade was actually pretty nice and apologetic, said it was impossible to refund though. She said she would investigate the problems I went through and would take action. But yeah. Fuck LA Fitness. I hope these shady fucks go out of business. TL;DR - LA Fitness is skeevy as fuck and tried to shame me into signing up for their personal trainer and then made fun of me when I tried to cancel my membership.

Yeah in my situation the GM was the only one who was reasonable! He must have realized how persistent I would be.

Do you think they actually cancelled it tho, or will you be charged next month and have to repeat the cycle. I've heard these guys just says 'yep, its done' and it's not done. ‚Äã Best of luck - hope they actually did it!

You must not have been around during aol dial up internet. Why was it so hard to cancel?  
I was around during dial up internet!  And LA Fitness only allows you to cancel in person 9AM to 5PM M-F or through mail. Gym memberships are known to be impossible to cancel because they don't want to lose the sale.   
I would of just showed up to cancel. Canceling aol internet was phone only, and it used to take us a few hours to cancel.

I once called a car dealership 322 times over the course of 90 days until they threatened to call the police on me for harassment.   Long story, they didn't make good on promises IN WRITING citing that the sales person that made those promises had no authorization to do so.  When i asked why the manager signed off, i was told (and i shit you not) "the managers don't review each and every letter written on a "we owe you" form".   In the end, i got what was coming to me, but it took a lot of effort to do so.  I'm also the guy that never ever ever goes away.  I will happily spend more time cost than value if i feel like i'm being screwed.  I applaud you, OP.  
What promise did they not initially deliver on?

Happy birthday! Turn on social media notifications and message your family. Tell them it's your birthday and you wanted to talk to them. Unless they're deadset arseholes in which case, just get by on social media and the new friends you'll make in your new area. Have you met any new friends yet?

How do you like Austin? I visited it once and LOVED it there.  
I stay in the downtown area. I‚Äôm still not used to how quiet and small it is, but it is comforting.  I just really like that everyone here is friendly.

This is surprising to me. I‚Äôve never been to Texas, but I thought Austin was a big city? In my experience the downtowns of big cities are very loud and large, does Austin have a reverse situation?

I hope that you call your family anyway, and that you have a Happy Birthday. Maybe challenge yourself to do something that you've never done before for your birthday. What is something a little crazy that you've always kind of wanted to do, but haven't?  
I definitely would love to try scuba diving, my only fear is getting stranded :)  
As someone who recently got their scuba license, DO IT. I was always curious but kind of terrified. My god it's a feeling that's out of this world. You feel like you're on another planet, weightless and silence all around you. It is honestly one of the most peaceful experiences you can have. Turns out I also had nothing to be afraid of, it was just beautiful. If you really want to try it out I highly recommend it.

What was your favourite subject in hs?  
I‚Äôd say math, I was already great at it. I loved math because it allowed me to understand how things work.  
So what made you want to move to Austin? Job?  
Yes, I was looking for a CS job in Chicago, and I was offered one in Austin for 70k/y entry level. I had to move but after months of job searching I was just happy to get an offer.

You have to tell yourself that this doesn't mean people don't love you and don't care about you.  My dad is TERRIBLE with dates. I know it's much worse when nobody remembers.  But to be quite honest with you, if I don't add people's birthdays to my calendar under their contacts, I'll forget about 90% of them.  So the reason you didn't get calls and texts is because your family didn't realize it's your birthday and quite frankly forgot what day it is. It'll hit them randomly soon and you'll get apologies.

You have to tell yourself that this doesn't mean people don't love you and don't care about you.  My dad is TERRIBLE with dates. I know it's much worse when nobody remembers.

Happy Birthday üéâüéà Hopefully your new job and the move was a good decision. Im sorry you had a lonely birthday. It's whatever!! Technology enables us to become dependent on it rather than connecting with humanity the way it once was. As long as you don't forget their birthdays, you're good.  
Thanks however it looks like the job move wasn‚Äôt worth it. I got laid off with the whole pandemic situation and the company couldn‚Äôt afford to lose 2 weeks of business. On the brightside side they gave us a 2 month salary bonus to ‚Äúsurvive‚ÄùüòÇ  
This plandemic craziness is too much already! A 2 month salary bonus sounds sweet!! Hang in there...  
It really is, however it‚Äôs like the next two months are on me to find another job and relax. Hopefully it won‚Äôt take longer now That I have expirence

Man, I live in Austin. If I weren‚Äôt in bed already (3kids) I‚Äôd say let‚Äôs go get drinks. Happy birthday. Go to Rain on 4th st. Tell even one person there it‚Äôs your birthday and next thing you know you‚Äôll have 37 friends kicking it with you. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I'm the 1/1mil statistic that had an actual adverse reaction to a vaccine and I am permanently vaccine injured. I am still strongly pro-vax. AMA
Assuming this is true, are you now scared of vaccines that you actually need? Vaccines you get as an adult still (tetanus for example)? Also, can you please elaborate on the Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© Syndrome? Is it painful? Do you have bad nerve pain from it? How is it on a day to day basis, is it always bothering you or only during flare ups/relapses? Thanks! I hope the best for you and that it leaves you alone man/girl. Stay strong =)  
Given that I have an auto-immune disorder and could potentially be sensitive to all vaccines, I've been advised not to receive any more. So I haven't been vaccinated since I was 14. It's very possible that another adverse reaction could kill me and even doctors don't think that it's a smart risk to take. Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© Syndrome is an extremely complex disorder that would take a really long time to fully explain, so the best information on the disorder itself can be found on medical sites. That said, yes, it's painful. I'm always in pain, even when I'm not flaring. I get random neuropathy, mostly in my extremities. Sometimes, it's just irritating. Other times, it's very painful. The daily non-flare/non-relapse issues are mainly generalized weakness, neuropathy, and severe fatigue. I have back and neck problems from it and I get headaches constantly. I have horrible allergies, which is pretty typical with auto-immune disorders. I still occasionally use a wheelchair depending on the situation I'm in and how my body is feeling that day. Flare-ups usually cause those daily symptoms to get a whole lot worse. My arms and legs will decide not to work. They aren't paralyzed, I still have sensation, but the muscles decide to tap out for a while. The fatigue is extreme and I spend most of my time sleeping. And yeah, the pain is a lot worse, too. Relapses......well, the last time, I was so weak and my nervous system was so messed up that I couldn't even sit up for more than five minutes at a time. I had to learn how to do tasks while lying down, using a pillow or something to prop my head up enough to see/eat/drink/etc. Any time I had to actually get up to do something, I'd usually end up lying on the ground gasping for air after a couple of minutes. It's extremely hard to breathe. Temporary paralysis happens. It's just not a fun time. And thank you for the well-wishes, I appreciate it a lot. :)  
Wow, thank you very much for taking the type to give such an extensive elaboration. I'm sorry you have to live with that, guy/girl. It sounds horrible. Do you at least take medicine for it? Gabapentin or pregabalin maybe? I imagine they'd help better than opiates for the actual neuropathy, gabapentin helps my neuropathy like magic. Much respect mate.  
No problem at all! There really isn't any medication for GBS. The mechanism of the neuropathy is difficult to address. I rarely take any painkillers since the daily amount of pain is manageable. I'm on psych meds and painkillers don't always mix well. It's an annoying balancing act. But I do take some on the occasions that the pain gets bad enough that I can't move, or if the intensity makes me vomit. Thankfully, that doesn't happen too often.

Have you tried gabapentin for the pain? Ive had nerve issues for over a decade. Then a new nerve issue arose and they gave me gabapentin. I'm almost back to pre nerve pain normal. Just a sharp pain here and there vs all day.  
I'm the 1/1mil statistic that had an actual adverse reaction to a vaccine and I am permanently vaccine injured. I am still strongly pro-vax. AMA
How are you doing?  
Honestly, life is a real struggle. I never know when my GBS is going to decide to flare up and there's no way to tell how long the flare-ups are going to last. I could also have another relapse at any time. Living with so many unknowns isn't the easiest. It's hard to make commitments, and when the symptoms are combined with those from my other health issues, it's impossible to work any kind of regular job.

How do Karen‚Äôs look at you knowing that you have been hurt by vaccines but still support them?  
They actually accuse me of being a well-paid shill for big pharma. My bank account balance says otherwise.  
Strange. My mum likes to use vaccine-injured people like you as a reason to propagate her anti-vaxx beliefs.  
Surprisingly, I've rarely had people use my story as validation for their fear of vaccines. Anywhere I could see it, at least. But I've made my stance on that line of thinking very clear. One person having a reaction like mine is so much better than 999,999 others being unprotected against preventable diseases that can and will kill a lot of them.

Were you told you‚Äôre not allowed to receive certain shots in the future? My partner was recently diagnosed with GBS and was advised not to get the flu shot again. Also I thought GBS eventually goes away and if the symptoms continue to flare up it‚Äôs most likely CIDP?  
Yes, I was. Doctors have advised me to not receive any more vaccinations at all due to the state of my immune system. Which is really scary, especially right now. You're correct, 70% of people with GBS recover within three years and never experience any symptoms again. Technically, GBS never fully goes away and can be triggered again by another extreme immune response, but most people never have an issue with it after they recover. CIDP is very similar and symptoms that persist absolutely can be a sign of CIDP. There are, however, a slim minority of GBS survivors who continue having symptoms of GBS and even experience full relapses. There isn't much knowledge on it yet. I think that I've read every study on it that's out there. But it has been observed in some particularly unlucky individuals like myself. Also, I wish your partner good health and a speedy full recovery! GBS is no fun but recovery is very likely!  
Thanks for your reply. I‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôre one of the unlucky ones with ongoing issues. My partner is already onto his third dose of ivig since he got GBS in July so drs were thinking it might be CIDP but the lumbar puncture results still suggest GBS. I can already see what a toll this horrible syndrome takes on people :( as he is struggling a lot emotionally as well as obviously physically. Do you get ivig when you have flare ups or one of the other treatment methods? Wishing you better health for the future too, hoping you can eventually overcome this nasty condition.  
So far, it's been the opinion of the doctors that I've seen that I've had GBS for so long that any treatment would be ineffective. If I do have another complete relapse, though, I will definitely pursue IVIG treatments. If there's even a tiny chance that it will hope, I'm happy to try it.

Did you go to "vaccine court" aka National Vaccine injury Compensatory Program? Were you awarded any money? What was the process like?  
I wish I had a more positive answer to this, but no, I didn't. As a kid, I had no idea that the program existed. Unfortunately, my parents didn't know, either. It wasn't as high-profile 15 years ago as it is now. By the time that I learned about it, the period of eligibility had expired. And, while I think that it's kind of ridiculous for there to even be a period of eligibility for something like this as long as there is a history of medical documentation to prove a patient's timeline, the rules are the rules and my hands are tied.  
I am so sorry to hear that.  
It's honestly okay. As much as I could use the money, I could REALLY use the money, I'm not too upset about it. It is what it is. I don't blame anyone for what happened so I don't feel like I'm owed some kind of compensation.

Your post triggered me, as I'm (Dutch, f, 33) also one of these 1/1mil üòä and strongly pro-vax! So afraid I'll get sick, because other people don't vaccinate...  You wrote, that you're always in pain. I know what you mean. Hopefully, you'll learn how to deal with and accept the pain. My therapist once asked me if my pain was only negative, but it also made me stronger and makes me see the world in a different way. How do you feel about your pain, for that matter? Very trivial, but how do you feel about traveling? I find it kinda sad, that I'm not able to visit countries where you'd need to be vaccinated before visiting them.  
The pain can be hard to handle sometimes, but I don't have overwhelmingly negative feelings about it. I've accepted my situation for what it is and I do the best that I can. Honestly, I don't even give it much thought anymore. Focusing on the negative makes everything seem negative. I'm definitely not happy to be in pain but I don't let it have much power over me. I ignore it as much as possible whenever I can, but I also accept that I need a lot of rest and if the pain is telling me to stop something, I should stop it, at least for a little bit so I can recuperate. I'm sorry, that isn't a very clear answer. I think that the best way to explain it is that I've accepted the pain as a part of myself and my life. It doesn't make me happy but I don't resent it and I don't dwell on it. I love traveling so, so much. But yeah, I also find it sad that there are places that I can't visit. At the same time, I know that it's for the best, both for me and for the people in those areas. I would hate to unwittingly carry a harmful disease into am area where people are particularly susceptible to it. The rules are there for a reason and I won't try to break them. There's still a LOT of the world that I can visit and that makes me very happy.

Can you recall exactly what happened that day?  
Yes, I remember it vividly. Not the appointment itself, but what happened afterward. It started with my arm swelling up so big that my swim teammates were teasing me about doing steroids. It was probably three times its usual size and it really hurt. Then I started having serious breathing problems somewhere from 24 to 48 hours after the injection. From there, it was a rapid decline into a very severe illness that I genuinely can't fully remember because I was pretty messed up. But I do remember that my muscles seemingly atrophied overnight (it was a problem with the nerves, not the muscles, but that's what it felt like) and I had extreme breathing difficulty. Then the paralysis attacks started. And stroke-like symptoms. And I was suddenly hyper allergic to everything. It was a lot for 14-year-old me to handle.  
Do you remember what other, if any, vaccines you had that same day? You mentioned that you were behind in vaccines and I'm wondering if it could've been triggered by having several in one sitting. Pro-vax, just curious if this is plausible.

Hey there, I also had a reaction to a vaccine, but I‚Äôm not sure it caused any permanent problems. When I was around 12 I want to say..I went and got some of the required shots, I still don‚Äôt remember which shot it was, possibly measles? Nonetheless, over the next week I had severe cramps in the leg I got my shot in and I was unable to walk whatsoever, if I put even the tiniest amount of pressure onto that leg, I would fall on the ground screaming from how badly it hurt. Just curious, what were some of the first symptoms you had experienced from the shot/shots?  
First, my arm swelled up about three times its usual size and was very painful. Then, somewhere in the time frame of 24 to 48 hours after the shot, I started having serious difficulty breathing.

Hi, I think I've seen some of your tweets before. Massive respect to you for being so open.  My question is not about anti-vaxxers, as I've argued enough with them in my time!  I have spoken to staunch pro-vax people who flat out refuse to believe that anyone has genuinely been vaccine injured. Do you often get people trying to "debunk" your injury and argue with you? Edited to add another question as it's just popped into my head. Do you have a child/children? Or plan to have children? If so, would they be susceptible to a reaction too? Or is it in no way genetic?

But would you support more effort being put into vaccine safety seeing as how you are living proof that there are still issues with something they want literally every single person on the planet to get? And FYI  the stats on vaccine injuries are little higher than 1 in a million, but even at that number you are looking at 7.5 million children who will experience some or other problem associated with vaccination and when  you look at the reality of the actual numbers as opposed to the percentages, it suddenly looks a whole lot less like nothing and lot like something you can't blithely ignore.  
I have looked at the stats on vaccine injury and I have done a lot of my own research. I see nothing compelling that leads me to believe that the majority of reported "vaccine injuries" have anything at all to do with vaccines. But I'm not going to spend much time going down that road because I've found that arguing about that specific topic is a huge waste of energy for everyone involved. But, to answer your question, no. Any medical procedure comes with risk. Medical professionals can never guarantee how anyone's body is going to react to anything and we can't expect them to. It's unrealistic. People die from everyday procedures all the time, ones that should be "safe." There is no way to guarantee absolute safety. Do I think that they should always be looking for the safest way to do anything that they do? Absolutely. But there will always be people like me no matter what they do. We have to accept that.  
Here is my issue with this argument. There is a difference, and hopefully one you can appreciate, between something only given to someone if and when they need it, and something that is being made mandatory for every man, woman and child. Imagine if we woke up tomorrow and air was toxic for 1% of the total population. Everyone has to breathe it, but some people can't. Would you genuinely shrug it off as an acceptable risk   because  well you know everyone else gets to breath it safely? To make matters worse, you aren't allowed to object to lack of air safety - you will be vilified and legislated against. You won't be able to demand an alternative or use clean bottled air because what is wrong with you 'air is safe', and the systems to ensure air safety will look like something from the dark ages.  But yes, let's go with the acceptable risk argument. It makes perfect sense.  
Breathing air is very different from having a medical procedure performed. Medical science is extremely complicated because the human body is complex and unpredictable. What we know for certain, though, is that these vaccines were developed due to a legitimate need for protection from dangerous diseases that are now, thanks to those vaccines, largely preventable. The minimal risk that they pose is absolutely one that I find acceptable.

Do people use you/your story in anti-vaxx  propaganda?  
Not that I've seen. And I'm very grateful for that. I've had a handful of individuals say something along the lines of, "This is why people are scared," but I've shut that down as best as I can. I understand parents being afraid of something happening to their children, but they need to be afraid of the preventable diseases that are making a comeback due to their anti-vax nonsense.

Fascinating AMA by the way. In Japan they stopped giving the trivalent MMR shot in favour or single valent versions of each because of what seemed to be significant increase in GBS among MMR recipients. The theory was that the combination vaccine was just too much all at once for naive immune systems, so spreading the vaccinations out over time would help. In light of this, do you think that DTaP might be better administered in three single valent shots spread out over time rather than the combination shot all at once?

I read last night that someone was recently awarded millions to be paid out over the next handful of years based on a case where their asymptomatic 18 month old (now almost 30 years old) received a vaccine and was later diagnosed with autism. The article says that while the case was settled outside of court and the records were sealed, the doctors involved explicitly stated that the vaccine itself never caused the autism, only that it may have agrivated some dormant mitochondrial dna or something like that. I feel like this sets a dangerous precedent for anti-vaxxers of basically "it doesn't matter if we're wrong, if we don't stop fighting, the government will get annoyed and pay out, which we could go on to say 'I was right all along'."  What are your thoughts on this?

Why do you still support vaccines even though you were injured in pro vax too but is it because of the fact that it‚Äôs rarer than getting sick when did you notice do people accuse you of being paid by big pharma?(why did someone downvote this is it because of my bad grammar)(I‚Äôm j‚Äùnot anti vax)  
Yes, it's because vaccines do much more good than harm and the risk of having an adverse reaction to a vaccine is much, much lower than the risk of being harmed by the diseases that vaccines prevent. And yes, people love to accuse me of being paid by big pharma.

There are a lot more. Statistics are falsified / unreliable. https://youtu.be/KOK_rgr5U7w https://vaccineimpact.com/2017/gardasil-killed-my-16-year-old-daughter-she-died-the-most-excruciating-painful-death/  
Someone should let the health insurance industry and life insurance industry know. Having worked in analytics departments in both, every single model we produced (updated weekly/monthly depending on the specific model) showed that vaccines led to better health outcomes and longer lifespans, even after controlling for all other factors. I mean, you clearly know what you're talking about and could save these multi-billion-dollar industries a lot of money. You should waltz into one of those companies right now and tell them that all of their analysts are doing the math wrong, and to rely on you. You obviously know more about statistics than those have have multiple degrees in that very subject, such as myself and other colleagues I work with. What you have goes against what every single health insurance company and life insurance company has independently found about how safe and effective vaccines are at improving life outcomes on a large scale, or in other words, how benefits massively outweigh the costs. So by all means, go and try to convince one of these companies to hire you. Billions of dollars of profit are at stake (not dying = profit for life insurers, not getting sick = profit for health insurers), and these companies continually try to find and maintain a strong competitive edge. I maintain subscriptions to industry news, so I'll be waiting to read about a revolutionary predictive model about how vaccines are dangerous and to trash all our data because [random citizen] knows better.

What are the odds?  Sounds like an amazing love story, so good that I can imagine some some doubting it is true.  Did you never exchange pictures in the past or added each other on social media? Where you surprised what she looks like? How old are you guys? Did her moving to Denver had anything to do with you?  
the odds were immeasurably small, and sometimes i wake up wondering if the whole thing was a dream. we had never exchanged pictures, and we also didn‚Äôt really use social media, and we both liked the idea of just writing and talking without seeing our faces irl. we are now both 24, and she came to Denver to pursue her ambitions, but i guess my presence might have played a small part.  
Take the population of Denver, the population of the country, the population of her home town, the gross emigration from there and the gross immigration to Denver... I don‚Äôt know but someone could do the math.  
she had many cities in mind, but i guess my presence gave Denver the edge, so the odds weren‚Äôt that bad.

I was going to say 24, but didn‚Äôt see this until just now since I‚Äôm always doing something. It‚Äôs a matter of logic. 9 year olds doing pen-pal letters to other 9 year olds. After 10 years of writing letters, switched to email in 2014. So that‚Äôs 19 in 2014, and we‚Äôre towards the very end of 2019.  19+5=24. We can also say that if after 10 years of writing you switched to email in 2014, you started writing in 2004. 9 years prior to ‚Äò04 would be 1995. I don‚Äôt mean to sound like a stalker-y person by all of this. I get caught up in whatever the topic is and so I tend to pay more attention to details and make more ‚Äúout-of-the-box‚Äù deductions than someone would normally take the time to do so because society norms say that people don‚Äôt want to read walls of text or take the time to have a version of phone tag that involves even more walls of text. People live in a world where 140 character maximums are sufficient to get their points across. I don‚Äôt.

By my own calculation, the chance of moving in the same city as yours reaches 1 in 500. Since the small businesses in denver is 11000, the chance is: 1 in 5.5 Million

What was the spirit and essence of these letters and emails that kept the pen friendship going for so long?  
we were both introverts, and thus writing was a way both of us could freely express ourselves.  i was motivated to keep writing as her personality was just great, she was funny and confident, and we both could share our personal problems, and just talk about life.  honestly, the 15 years and nearly 1000 letters and emails passed so quickly, and i‚Äôm just so glad i participated in that program in the first place.  
That's amazing. I hope these writings are kept and you could some way memorialise and share some key milestones at your wedding or life events. Cheers.  
i think a wedding is jumping the gun a bit, but we both still have 99% of our letters and all of our emails. i think 3-4 letters have been damaged and i remember that i split water on one of them.  
My penpal for 15 years turned out to be my colleague. AMA
What are the odds: maybe there are none, maybe she moved there on purpose and found a job there on purpose and didn‚Äôt tell you she moved to Denver on purpose too... because you are the purpose...  Think about it...  
i wish that was the case. she mainly came to Denver as she wanted to pursue her career her, but i like to think that i played at least a little part in her decision.  
No one just ups and moves to Denver. What career is in Denver that has a lot of choices in her field and offers a lot of room for advancement? I still doubt any of this is real. At 19 you two would have been texting, heck at 16 you would have been texting.  
Not too sure about the texting. Since 10 years I‚Äôm in contact with a french guy, we only write through Facebook; it‚Äôs like a pen pal.  We met two years ago and still only wrote Facebook messages and never text; the only exception was the Time I deleted myself from FB for several years so we switched to email and we occasionally exchange letters. It‚Äôs just a different medium than texting  Not saying this story is necessarily true, just wanted to give my input about the texting / emailing

I have at least 10 friends from college who decided to up and move to Denver when we graduated because it‚Äôs an amazing city that‚Äôs got a ton of culture and outdoor activities. I do not find that strange at all. This was 11 years ago and they have all stayed and pursued their careers there.

I think it‚Äôs odd that the person you confided in so deeply and shared so many personal things with... didn‚Äôt tell you she was moving to your city. That would have happened the first moment a potential move even became a consideration, including employment and living recommendations. I want to believe, OP; help me in my unbelief.  
i do agree that i phrased it a little bit odd, but she tried to keep it a surprise, and thus didn‚Äôt tell me about moving to Denver until i asked. not to mention, she did tell me that she was planning to move to another city, but deliberately left the city unnamed, as she didn‚Äôt want to ruin the surprise.  
And then working at your place of work...was a coincidence?  Waiting for you to bring it up and surprise you? Stalking? It‚Äôs still confusing to me.

Wait.  You found that you worked with a person with a VERY common name - and you found that to be such a "hilarious coincidence" that you mentioned this to someone else named Jane? That sounds pretty fishy. And you were sending snail mail starting in 2004 - and continuing through 2014 before someone thought about using email? Nope. And you expect people to believe that you and Jane are 24 year old friends who are as close as you could be with someone you hadn't met - and you never connected on social media?  Never shared a photo? Not even remotely credible. OP, I'm not sure why you're lying about this - but you are.  I can't imagine what people to fabricate this sort of thing are thinking.  You are a person - and you matter - you don't need to make up silly shit to get people to pay attention to you.  Stop it. Edit: Having now thought about this for a couple minutes - there are other issues.: - 9 year olds who sign up for a pen pal are typically matched with children of the same sex.  This is primarily done so they tend to have more to connect about, but it's also a security matter. - I find it hard to imagine a boy and a girl who pass from childhood, through the teenage years and into adulthood, who connect and maintain that connection in the way you described.  It's not impossible, to be sure, but with everything else together it further suggests that you're lying. - Also, unless you're transgender, it would be very odd for anyone to describe their gender in the past tense.  That's a very odd thing which further suggests that you're not being honest. - And, surprise, it's a brand new account.   I note that multiple redditors have commented that this is such a sweet story.  I guess there are gullible people everywhere you go.  I'm 100% convinced that it's fake - but fake stories can still be sweet.  This isn't that either.  It reads like the work of a 14 year old who's seen too many Harlequin romance movies.  
Wait.  You found that you worked with a person with a VERY common name - and you found that to be such a "hilarious coincidence" that you mentioned this to someone else named Jane? That sounds pretty fishy. And you were sending snail mail starting in 2004 - and continuing through 2014 before someone thought about using email? Nope. And you expect people to believe that you and Jane are 24 year old friends who are as close as you could be with someone you hadn't met - and you never connected on social media?  Never shared a photo? Not even remotely credible. OP, I'm not sure why you're lying about this - but you are.  I can't imagine what people to fabricate this sort of thing are thinking.  You are a person - and you matter - you don't need to make up silly shit to get people to pay attention to you.  Stop it. Edit: Having now thought about this for a couple minutes - there are other issues.: - 9 year olds who sign up for a pen pal are typically matched with children of the same sex.  This is primarily done so they tend to have more to connect about, but it's also a security matter. - I find it hard to imagine a boy and a girl who pass from childhood, through the teenage years and into adulthood, who connect and maintain that connection in the way you described.  It's not impossible, to be sure, but with everything else together it further suggests that you're lying. - Also, unless you're transgender, it would be very odd for anyone to describe their gender in the past tense.

On this day in 2016 i had planned to commit suicide. 4 years later and my world is completely different. I have learned to love myself and i am better version everyday AMA
Why did you want to die? What made you change your mind?  
I was really struggling with depression. This was partially due to my body image, i was 6ft 3 and 70kg (now 93kg).  i had really struggled with my mum going through breast cancer as i didn't speak to anyone about it and bottled it all up. I was ashamed with how i handled visiting her in the hospital and should have seen her more often. A week before i was going to kill myself someone i was friends with jumped in front of a train, killing himself. I saw the effect his death had on the people around me, people who he didnt think care about him we distraught and i saw how devastated his family was. I remember breaking down a couple nights later after the shock had worn off and promised myself i would never put my friends and family through that  
Man, I'm so sorry to hear that about your friend. That's gotta be kind of tough to reconcile that he is the reason you're still here today. You made a good decision to keep fighting and stay  
I think about him often, i wasn't a really close friend but i new his parents well and had known him for years. i was also the last person, aside from his parents, to see him alive. I wish i could have said something to him but i was angry as he had just lied to everyone about his dad having cancer

And i say this bc i want to know if you were bullied or something like that. Btw congrats!

Thank you for sharing this. I'm currently in a similar place to where you were, but trying to seek help so I don't hurt my friends and family. How did you move forward after deciding to live?  
So i really just started analysing myself. At the end of the day i would i write down what made me happy today. Anything small, like singing in the shower or working out. I would then make a list of anything that lowered my mood throughout the day. I would then make sure i did the things that made me happy and avoided the things that i didn‚Äôt like. I would also write down what i didn‚Äôt like about myself but only specific things. things that i could work towards and change about myself. I now know how to make myself happy when i'm sad, how to motivate myself and how to improve myself.  
How do you motivate yourself? And how do you improve yourself ? I‚Äôm kinda in a dark place right now after a break up and I really want to work out because I consider myself too thin but I cannot get the motivation.

I am genuinely considering suicide right now. I‚Äôve recently been doing riskier things and living on the edge knowing that if anything happens I‚Äôd be fine with it. AP scores are released tomorrow and I checked early and I didn‚Äôt get above a 2 on any of my 4 exams. In our culture failure isn‚Äôt taken well. I‚Äôm so scared for the disappointment she‚Äôd express and she‚Äôs been getting mad at me recently and criticizing me for everything. I want to do it but I know I shouldn‚Äôt. Just wanted to vent there‚Äôs no question  
Firstly, I took AP tests too, and by holy fucking Christ it was a shitshow.  The fact that you took four of those fucked up exams is something to be proud of, passing or not, regardless of what she thinks. You know how hard it was. You know the toll it took on you. If nobody else is, I am proud of you. I'm extremely fucking proud of you. And if it makes you feel better, this year's scores are likely not going to be held against us, so I wouldn't fret.  What I need you to know is that life changes. Life changes man. Life has changed alot, is changing alot right now, and it's going to be changing alot in the future. You won't be in the same position you're in right now in a year or two. Change is going to happen. You're going to graduate. Your going to move out. You're going to meet someone you're going to want to spend your life with.  Life is a shitshow right now man. It just is. Its fucking horrible. Theres so many reasons to just give up and not enough to stay.  You're going through the darkest part of the tunnel. You're in the pits of it. It just seems like it goes on forever. You just dont even care about anything anymore. Not even yourself. So you're taking these risks. She is feeling it too. The stress. She's going through shit as well. She's taking some of it out on you, and probably doesn't even know it.  I guess the only thing I can say is life will change. Its gonna change. You're going to look back on this part of your life and see how far you've come. I cant tell you when, but you will. Life will change. Because that's what it does. For better and for worse, highs and lows. Give your life a chance to change. I promise its going to be so worth it.

This really means a lot to me. I don‚Äôt know how to show my gratitude to everyone who has responded to me and cared about what I had to say because it feels nice having people care. Thank you so much. I really mean it

Side. i like to choose how much ketchup each chip gets. Like the crunchy burnt ones don't really need it

Today is 17 days for me. I was really close. I had the gun on my coffee table and I was laying on the couch thinking and sobbing and getting ready... and then my cat jumped on me and I kind of snapped out of it. The past two months has been hard. I stopped taking my antidepressants and I pretty much lost it. Everything was just too overwhelming, it got to be too much. My boss pulled me into the office  two days after my near attempt, and long story short I just broke down and told him everything. He helped me get a doctor, I‚Äôm back on medication and I‚Äôm so thankful for the people I work with for being so understanding. And for my cat being the sweet love bug she is. My dad committed suicide when I was younger, and I always swore I could never do that to my family but I get it now. Sometimes it‚Äôs just too much. I just had to get that off my chest. I haven‚Äôt told my boyfriend. I sort of told my mom, but she just thinks I had a break down at work. I don‚Äôt know if I can tell them.  Congrats to you, and to all the others. And stay strong üí™  
I'm sorry to hear you were so low recently - and am so glad you were able to snap out of it. Praise to the kitty!! And it's amazing you were able to get help from your boss like that! That is so rare. Definitely something to be grateful for, and proud of! --You are the kind of person an employer like that wants to hire and keep around, which means you must have a lot going for you :)  Mental illness is such a struggle. I have found that one of the greatest things for defending against my depression is having a vision to hope for and work towards. This post and OP's comments seem great for reminding me of practical things to do daily to try and strengthen and uplift myself. I know I need to change some things in my life in order to avoid what bring me down, and spend time focusing on and developing the things that make me happy. -- So simple, but SO not what I do everyday. Something else that has been on my mind the past couple days that has been helping me is the idea of intentionally thinking of my life as a story being written, for the benefit of my soul eternally. I'm naturally agnostic and have a lot of beef with organized religion, but the truth is -- nobody really knows if there is more to life than what we are currently experiencing, but I have found that it helps to allow myself to carry some form of eternal hope. If you can imagine any scenario where your (eternal) soul is able to take the good the bad and the ugly from this life, and the build upon it in whatever the next life happens to bring, then then perhaps it can lead to finding meaning in your struggles, making enduring them worthwhile? Anyways, sorry for the long comment. I wish you the best moving forward!

He helped me get a doctor, I‚Äôm back on medication and I‚Äôm so thankful for the people I work with for being so understanding. And for my cat being the sweet love bug she is. My dad committed suicide when I was younger, and I always swore I could never do that to my family but I get it now. Sometimes it‚Äôs just too much. I just had to get that off my chest. I haven‚Äôt told my boyfriend. I sort of told my mom, but she just thinks I had a break down at work. I don‚Äôt know if I can tell them.  Congrats to you, and to all the others. And stay strong üí™  
Today is 17 days for me. I was really close. I had the gun on my coffee table and I was laying on the couch thinking and sobbing and getting ready... and then my cat jumped on me and I kind of snapped out of it.

What do you mean by a better version of yourself u/what-do-you_mean ?  
Ahh yes. Well i write down what i want to improve about myself, only things that are realistic. I originally had 4 categories that i wanted to improve. My organisation, mentally relaxing, being physically active and hygiene. In each category i would have 3 items. Each goal was something that i could change about myself overnight, e.g. washing my face, listening to a podcast, updating a calendar. I would then have 4 don'ts. These were 4 things that i need to stop doing or reduce.  At the end i find i'm a better person, i'm kinder to myself and to others

Hey I can relate, planned it on my 25th bday, I'll be 28 this year. I wanna ask, what steps did you take or what influences helped change your perspective of yourself? I love hearing positive outcomes like this  
I would just write down what i liked and what i didn‚Äôt like each day. Any small insignificant thing that made me smile that day i wrote down. The next day i would try and do as many of those things as possible. And on the contrary i would avoid all the things that i didn't like. How many times do you do something a feel shit after and think i always feel like this after x? For me it was a lot. This is where i first really started to take of myself and i learned what i like doing and loved doing those things. I would then look at ways i could improve myself. Things such as hygiene was great for me. It feels good to care for yourself. My confidence also grew immensely through working out. I've put on a lot of muscle and like how i look in the mirror  
That's really good stuff, thanks for sharing. I did t write down positives, maybe I should start that. It would certainly help me I think. Thank you

First of all, I want to congratulate you. Second, what was wrong with your image? I'm curious because I have literally the same measures  
Partly because i played Rugby i was particularly conscious about my size, i also had been teased a lot about being skinny so my self confidence was really low  
Yeah I've also had problems with being skinny but that's why I started doing weightlifting a couple months ago. Unfortunately, due to corona, it has taken away my drive to lift weights  
I blessed with having some room at home so i've managed to keep up my workouts. All low weights and high reps but it's doing the trick. I‚Äôve been smashing through the preworkout to keep me motivated for home workouts though, but i always feel a lot better after. Are you taking any supplements to help with putting on mass?

What do you feel is the first step to the road to recovery? What would you say to yourself to really change your mind? How planned out and committed were you to it? Thank you for sharing and I'm glad you have been able to fight past that point in your life. Stay strong and live long

As someone who has gone through suicide attempts personally, do you find yourself having suicidal thoughts throughout these 4 years? Keep it up, youre worth it.  
I haven't, as soon as i decided that suicide was not an option i never considered it again. Depression and anxiety has felt like a race. It's like it's just over my shoulder and if you let it it catches up. At the moment i'm winning the race and i can feel myself pulling away. A few months ago i had an experience that almost broke me and i went back into survivor mode. But i'm back on track

Do you think you're cured of depression or you managed to live and cope up with it by learning to love yourself? I am asking because I think the thought of having depression is a curse and I don't think I'll ever be free of it. Thinking like that makes me just give up like "This is a disease and there's nothing I can do about it.

I went through the same about 6 years ago. From reading your responses, what lead me there was different, but in the end we all understand each other once we‚Äôve reached that bleak point. Thank you for sharing your story and opening up to questions. I know for me, seeing that I wasn‚Äôt alone back then helped a ton.  What helped the most was getting on the right medication and taking time out of my day to meditate (which was totally new to me). If you‚Äôre severely depressed and reading this please don‚Äôt underestimate how much the right antidepressant can help. There are a lot of them and it can take time to find the one that works for you because every brain is different. But when I got mine settled, I felt completely normal and simply balanced like my old self, gradually over about 6 months.  Now I‚Äôm a mom with an even better reason to live (that‚Äôs the part where my world is completely different). It‚Äôs hard to imagine life before my daughter.  2020 has been ROUGH for my anxiety though. Have you found it hard to navigate current events? What do you do to cope? I think I still have guilt that I wanted to die. And now I‚Äôm constantly worried that there‚Äôs a real chance that I could die and leave my daughter motherless.  Sorry for rant.

I‚Äôve struggled with wanting to kill myself as well. In real up and down. What advice would you give me?  
When i was up i would write messages of encouragement and motivation for myself to read when i was down. I find words of encouragement from yourself are a lot more powerful  
Any suggestions?

I heard the hospitals are in bad shape. 200% capacity in ICUs, people under 65 being turned away, strokes and heart attacks not even getting treated. Have you seen any of this or heard of it?  
To be honest, only in lombardy the situation is critical and the lockdown was set to prevent additional spreading. You will be turned away only if you have minor symptoms. Into hospitals there are only really bad or "only" bad cases, if you manifest minor symptoms, you stay at home until recover or some worsening.  Strokes and heart attacks is still cured normally everywhere and all hospitals are trying to be ready to a spike of infection.  So, we are not living in a nightmare,  don't worry  
O you have no idea how your comment soothed me. I was so worried. I wish I could afford gold.  
Happy to ear that. I'm not minimizing or else, the situation is bad but we are not on the verge of the collapse yet.  I think the lockdown was necessary as early as last week but there still time and we're not sending people home to their death. Edit:  So, it seems that the lockdown measures of the past days have some effect on the spreading. Here the graph from an official site.  Hopefully it will be a positive trend.

Yes that‚Äôs my biggest fear right now as an American. That we will get to that point. I‚Äôm a nurse (but I don‚Äôt work in the hospital anymore thankfully) and this time of year is already almost at capacity and staffing is very thin. It‚Äôs scary.

In your comment on the other thread, you mention needing ‚Äúgood reason if you want to leave town‚Äù. Are there actually police restricting travel at the outskirts? What other involvement/enforcement action is your government taking to enforce the lockdown to your knowledge?  
There are random checks, is not heavily enforced, some people have being caught but it's on the people to do the right thing  
What happens when they are caught? are they just told to turn around and go home?  When you say town, is that like a city and its suburbs? or are the suburbs separate?   What if you work in another town? Are the businesses required to either pay you or allow you to work from home?  
I also jump in quick to answer the rest of the questions:  fine (250‚Ç¨ i believe) or prison without good reason yes. Good reasons are: for work, for necessary groceries if you dont have them in your city/ village, if you need medical help many places in italy are very country sided. I live in a village with 3k people. Towns are the closest to the villages at around 10-100k citizens and cities is everything above. if you still get to keep your job or arent send on vacation you are allowed to travel between both cities, however, the gov is advising to offer home office work I own a business in the service sector and cant really give home work to my employees. I sent 90% of my employees on vacation until the 3 of april. They are using up all the overtime and vacation days. If the situation isnt getting better I delay it till may.

Is there anyone outside taking a walk? Can you go to the bank as well as the grocery store? Or to a mall? Are shops open? Do you get a sense your neighbors are sick? Or is t far and few between?  
You can go outside and to shops, there are just restriction on how many people can stay close together  
So there are shops open?? Meaning some people are still going to work? I‚Äôm confused, that doesn‚Äôt sound like a lockdown ... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  
People are restricted to move and can't aggregate, a lot of shops are open and people go to work  
You can go outside and to shops, there are just restriction on how many people can stay close together  
How is that restriction enforced? Just trust?  
i went to McDonald's the other day and the stuff would tell you to stay 1 meter away from each other and if you get close they will remind you again. a guy was hugging his wife and got really pissed of cause he had to keep a distance lol  
How is that restriction enforced? Just trust?  
Police forces check, just a little tho

What is the general sentiment from people you know? Are people very worried, or is it simply an inconvenience. I know you had mentioned people arent necessarily raiding the grocery stores.  Also, how many people are still going to work? How many places are closed?

It doesn't work nowhere because people aren't taking it serious enough. Even in Germany peoples biggest concern is missing festivals and football games. At work I have to fill in for a colleque because she went to the Doc with her child. Another person who might have Corona was there as well, withouth warning the doc or anything you HAVE to do. Anyway every person who was there yesterday has to stay at home for two weeks. Great. What a bunch of morons.

How far has the virus spread in your area?  
Guy living the first day of lockdown in Italy AMA
Are you afraid?  
Nope, the virus is dangerous only for old or sick people, the lockdown is not that drammatic  
I understand not being afraid of the virus (I‚Äôm not either) but how about being afraid of people going nuts/ panicking etc.?  
The situation looks pretty calm right now, I don't think it's gonna get that bad

People can go to work  
Do you know the restrictions on this? For example if you can work from home you should but if not, go to work and keep distance?

Has your University articulated their plan for students? I'm a geology student, and a lot of classes in my department could not be done online, because they require samples, field work, maps, etc. I'm curious about what your University is doing for students in those kinds of degree programs.

Are you concerned for your health (that you may catch the virus)  
Not op but I'm also italian and live in one of the "red zones". I'm not afraid for myself since it's not that dangerous for young/healthy people but I'm concerned for my parents and grandparents  
Which are the red zones? Is it still mainly in the northern provinces or are there cases all over the country now?

How badly are people freaking out over there?  
I‚Äôm not from Italy but from Germany and people here are going crazy. There is no toilet paper, no noodles, no flour, no rice and every store is out of disinfectant gel/wipes/whatever. Yesterday, two Germans died due to the virus and it‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs on the news (I have to add: They were both kinda old and I‚Äôm pretty sure I heard that one of them had some heart problems or something).  The minister of health said to avoid public events with more than 1000 people. Politicians are discussing possibilities of a lockdown (so far, we‚Äôve had cases of the virus in 15 out of 16 states. The state I live in has the most (almost 600) cases) but tHaT wOuLd Be BaD fOr EcOnOmY miMiMiMiMiimiiIiIii. However, if the virus keeps spreading like this, we‚Äôll have around 100,000 infected people by the end of April and almost 1,000,000 by the end of May. This will lead to a full utilisation of all capacities (tests, hospitals, medication). So Italy is definitely doing the right thing. I‚Äôm not scared of the virus (I‚Äôm a bit worried about my dad because he‚Äôs had two heart attacks and he has a very weak immune system). I just hope that if there was to be a lockdown, it should be before the next semester starts (April 1st) so I don‚Äôt have to take online classes.  
How badly are people freaking out over there?  
I feel like the news portrays Italy as falling apart, but it seems pretty average right now.

After being a drug dealer I can see that the government will never come close to winning the war on drugs or eradicating gangs AMA
Agree there‚Äôs no winning. How would you reduce  or better manage gangs or drugs if you were the government, a cop, or a parent?  
I‚Äôm not sure how you could solve it apart from legalising drugs, take money from the criminals and decriminalise addicts and control and regulate drugs. That would go a long way. The one thing I see which is always the same all gang members are from a somewhat broken home and the more broken/abusive the more violent and committed to the life they are. So I would say strengthen support systems for young people and focus on ending poverty. Also make punishments not as harsh for low level corruption, once a police officer has taken a bribe or done something corrupt, they are stuck and just deep a bigger whole. But mainly legalise drugs that‚Äôs gangs main income usually and people die because they cut drugs with dangerous stuff, legalising drugs would solve that  
As a former cop, I agree whole heartedly with legalization... mainly because drugs is a "my body, my choice" thing, but also to hit the wallets of the drug rings. I also think more research and education should be going along with the legalization.

I think the education is key too. I remember being in grade school taught all drugs were bad. I don't care for any of them but booze and tobacco are probably way worse of an impact than weed. I've also heard plenty of accounts where weed is all someone touches (so much for "gateway drug") and booze is probably far more dangerous than weed as far as what it does to the brain.  But people also assume if you smoke, you'll want it all the time. Do I show up drunk to work? No. Would I expect someone showing up high as hell? No. That's common sense

Bro all the research backs up everything you‚Äôre saying here. In countries where drugs have been legalised and regulated, it has virtually wiped out the crime related to it.  
Which countries?

So what you're saying is, we will never solve the war on drugs in America. Because hate to say it ain't so and don't disagree with you, that just doesn't seem to be in the cards in this lifetime.

what‚Äôs your favorite drug? what‚Äôs the worst you‚Äôre seen a drug/drug addiction to do someone??  
My favourite would be LSD or possibly heroin (I snorted it once back when I was 14 and never did it again after that), I‚Äôve seen someone crash a funeral high on amphetamines, someone‚Äôs tried to give away there unborn baby‚Äôs crib for a fix, I‚Äôve seen some try and sell their fathers boat, I‚Äôve seen people steal from family and I‚Äôve seen people‚Äôs skin literally rot off, I‚Äôve  seen someone pick heroin over their family, I‚Äôve seen someone cough blood (a lot of it too) and I‚Äôve seen a close friend become a heroin addict and lose everything. I‚Äôve seen too many things to list and the worst thing depends on what your priorities are, I think it‚Äôs sadder seeing someone lose everything than OD and dying but most things I‚Äôve seen is pretty horrific  
those are all very tragic things:( how did you stop yourself from doing heroin again??  
After using it, I was depressed because I new I would never feel so good again. It‚Äôs honestly so good it‚Äôs indescribable and I understood how i could easily spiral into abuse and made it a no question rule that I would never do any opiates again as I‚Äôve seen how bad addiction is

The underground economy fascinates me. How did you keep track of your profits? Were you independent? You mention eradicating gangs. Were you in a gang?  
I‚Äôm overly organised and obsessive about money, I kept a detailed record of all my income and expenses, until I made to much to keep track of. I became independently eventually after working with a group. The police would of called us a gang but we always said we were just entrepreneurs, we were kind of a gang but not a traditional one. We beefed and worked with a lot of street gangs though who are deeply rooted in the community and cannot easily be eradicated  
Thanks for answering, like I said the underground economy is interesting. I wonder how much GDP is unaccounted for? Anyway, what do you think about dark web sites and drugs? Are they the future?  
For more careful responsible drug users but a heroin addict won‚Äôt want to wait 3 days shipping, addicts won‚Äôt know how or have the patience to use it. It helped me start selling valium originally and is good for buying illicit precursors, many people tell me it‚Äôs golden age has passed and I would hate to see the police be able to shut it down. I‚Äôm not very techy though, I have no idea if that‚Äôs possible GDP, it‚Äôs got to be billions I would think ? when your adding in fraud and high level organised crime it‚Äôs gotta be a really high figure

Getting stabbed, my friend got 8 years, another friend got badly jumped, my brother and my friend got addicted to drugs I used to sell, my parents finding out, losing all my money and getting serious threats and best times counting my money, realising I was actually a respected dealer in my area, eating every day and never going hungry, mocking my teacher who said I was a failure and telling him how my watch costs more than he makes in a year (Yh ik that was harsh but I was younger) and getting the money which will let me go to university to name a few

Would of guessed it but not long after that the school nurse told all the teachers I had been stabbed and then they all kinda new. I think my parents might of told them as well Wdym status ? Status at school or as a dealer ?

How common is rivalry? Like how many other plugs would you get into beef with? How big is the city you're in, in terms of population?  
I‚Äôm in a big town. Rivalry depends on what approach you take, when I was in my group we had 3 main gangs we really beefed and had 2 allies gangs but the beef was partly because of postcode and history.  You could stay out of other people‚Äôs way make less money and have no rivals or you could go all out and try run the borough, no point tho because you‚Äôll just lose money if you go all out and beef will never end. Most people beef around one or two groups and it‚Äôs more because of petty reasons as much for the territory. Everyone just wants the parks and the big estates

What was your closest call?  
With police ? They raided a house that I was confronting someone at, they arrested 7 of my associates but I got over then fence with a few other people. With rivals ? I was stabbed but after 10 mins got up an walked home, I was fine after 2 days and another time I was getting chased and nearly got hit by a car, it stoped just in time and only tapped me  
Did you choose to be a drug dealer? If yes, why?  
I was kinda pressured in but it was my choice, I just wanted money I can‚Äôt lie. Started with needing school uniform an more important stuff but just turned into wanting luxury stuff and then I realised that I do enjoy dealing

Sorry if this is too personal, but what do you deal? Weed, coke, MDMA? Edit: also, have an upvote :)  
Originally coke, valium and ket, I then progressed to heroin and spice K2. Then I became a small time dealer only making a lot less and sold MDMA, most psychs, THC extracts, GHB and some lesser known stuff  
Wow. So you would front the money, and just hope to earn it back?  I would never deal, but how does one get started?  
I originally washed cars till I had enough to invest in coke, I then invested the profit in buying more coke and so on. Or older people will supply you and you sell it then pay them back, that‚Äôs often risky though as you don‚Äôt want to get in debt and your held accountable if you get robbed or the stuff gets confiscated.  
Wow. So you would front the money, and just hope to earn it back?  I would never deal, but how does one get started?  
Sometimes a dealer will bankroll you to get started.  For me I had been a buyer for a while and started picking up for others whilst there. Then realised I could party for free by buying in bulk and splitting. Then I realised I could make money as well. Went to my dealer, asked for a list of stuff on Tick. Went into a weekly cycle. Pick up on Thursday, pay on Tuesdays.  Worked well and just kept escalating.

One of two drugs I ever tried and I ended up losing my mind for like 6 hours straight. It was awful.

What is a fun, safe, non addictive drug? I'm too chicken to have ever tried anything,  
LSD, shrooms, 2cb, weed, MDMA, GHB, Ketamine to name a few. As long as you are not under 25, test your product, take a sensible does and take it in a safe environment all of those substances are perfectly safe  
Agreed on LSD and shrooms, but saying that weed, MDMA or ketamine are non-addictive is pure nonsense.

Yeah for sure, I‚Äôd say that shrooms is safer than lsd just because of the natural/ lab aspect of each drug, and I‚Äôve seen people completely fall off because they did acid wayyyy too often. I just do shrooms maybe once a year, and I smoke weed 3 nights a week. I‚Äôm at my best and still improving in almost every aspect of my life currently, and these drugs can help you pinpoint your weaknesses and instead of running from them, facing them and resolving them

Psychedelics are known for being one of the safest drugs. My DOC was LSD. The harmful part of them is the horror if you were to get a bad trip (I've had like 2 bad trips in my life and I've taken it probably 100 times). Even bad trips won't kill you though

Not to be rude, but did that ever motivate you to maybe stop selling to certain people, or at least try to help certain customers? I don't want to sound like a jerk, but I would feel horrible doing the stuff you did

How much did you make doing this? My mom was a drug dealer when I was too young to remember, often going to Vegas for a night to sell and then coming back the very next morning to Washington state.

We never seemed to be rich, but I was a little spoiled and had a lot of toys? And I never knew what she sold either. So, what‚Äôs the paycheck like?

I agree. I don‚Äôt really know how I feel about legalizing powerful drugs like heroin. I‚Äôm not sure how you use it but if you inject it, let‚Äôs say someone gets some legally, then jabs someone randomly, sure they would feel good but what about afterward? I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is that legalizing strong drugs could backfire? Having said that; I‚Äôve smoked weed and why it wasn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd smoke every day, I prefer herbal cigarettes, I think it‚Äôs disgustinghow you‚Äôre put behind bars for years just because you have weed on you.

I had a friend who used to deal drugs and do other assortments of things. He came out of school with really good grades and had UE. However he mixed with the wrong people and dropped out and began the cycle on offending in the judicial system in New Zealand until they started the rehab process. What do you think would prevent people from mixing with the wrong people? How do we prevent people from mixing with the druggies and the gangs?

In order to win the war on drugs is not going after the dealers or producer, it's going after the user. Cut the demand, the supply is useless. Americans are indirectly fueling the illegal drug industry by snorting cocaine in a club on a Tuesday evening. And they have too thick of a skull to realize this.

Favorite Bond movie and Actor? Did you meet Pierce?  
Wow, that was fast. My favorite bond I have to say which surprises some is Timothy Dalton since I felt his personality is more drawn to Bonds personality in the books, favorite bond movie though would be The Spy Who Loved Me because of the large set pieces, action pieces, and of course Jaws! He's the bloody best. As for ever meeting Pierce in person, I have not since he was always so in tune and intertwine with Martin and the choreographers and while a few cheeky extras did try to go up and talk to him, he was still humble and approachable but was always too busy to have a conversation longer than 60 seconds.

Thanks for answering. License to kill is so underrated IMO. So violent for Bond which I like.   
True that. Dalton was ahead of his time. After Moore the producers wanted someone a little less serious and Pierce was perfect but he was contracted to something else. Daltons Licence to Kill was a phenomenal film and and has aged very well, and his bond reminds me a lot Craig‚Äôs bond.

Brother. I was an extra in Quantum of Solace. It was my only acting experience in my life, and I doubt I‚Äôll ever do it again because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever top that. I was just in the right place at the right time, and I just ran with the opportunity.  Was this true for you? Because it was for me. The protagonists in the movie we‚Äôre jerks (not really I‚Äôm sure they were just busy, focused, and taking their job seriously in their own way). The antagonists were the nicest people I had ever met, as soon as the cameras stopped it seemed like they had time for everyone, and they never acted like they were too good for anyone. My opinion is that they felt bad for the roles they were playing, being such evil people. Was this an observation you made as well?   
Good question. First off congratulations on being an extra in your own film. Now as for your question I had already done one movie and was eager to do another one, bigger and better which was what I relayed to my agent. She was just a doll and pulled through for me because 'A' she was the best, and 'B' she was getting paid so she wanted nothing more but for me to get the best cause a better role meant more money for her.  Secondly it was a more closed set and while they may have came off to be jerks, I knew they really weren't because they do acknowledge our presence and even spoke a few minutes to the extras that went to talk to them, but they always had to get back into rehearsing and studying their dialogue so we all understood. The people that were the real wankers were the extras that take their role more serious than the director. Like they have a small nutcracking role and they're acting like they're the main star, always trying to be in the front of the camera for ever little thing then complain and whine that they didn't get to be the one that gets shot on screen for that split second. We only had a few of those but they were the hard ones to work with.

Wow, huge goldeneye fan, I would rent it on VHS as a child and  watch it twice in a row, it would piss my grandmother off.  What did you think your wardrobe ? Do you remember the specific style of cap you had on. And the question I always ask extras: Did you take any props lol

What was your family's reaction when you first told them you were going to be in a bond film?   
My mum first asked me if I was gonna be the main villain which I told her no but I would technically be one of the bad guys, and I  promised her she will see me at least once. She didn't like it when my character got shot up though, hah. Besides that my father practically told everyone at his workplace and went on about it for weeks. I met my wife in 97 and had a child that same year, but my son didn't first see the movie until like 2009 and we watch the movie atleast once a year now as a family.  
I love this, thank you so much. I always wanted to be in a bond film, regardless of which side. Let's be real though, the bad guys were for the most part, pretty cool.   
I was an extra in the James Bond film Goldeneye (1995) as a soldier.
Did your character survive his Bond encounter?   
So funny thing is that my 'character' was killed, resurrected and killed again in the archives. The first one he was killed when all those barrels came crashing down and promptly the building exploding later in the scene. (The barrels that fell were made of rubber by the way, my son always thought it was real metal and they just had stuntmen at the bottom.) And in the archives I was the soldier on the right that bond shoots at below on the second jump take from the first salvo of rounds he fires at the previous troops.  
I was an extra in the James Bond film Goldeneye (1995) as a soldier.
How many clips did you film? ‚Äã  
If I can remember 20 years ago how filming went, we filmed about over 20 different clips of angles the cinematographers felt would be the best in the scene at the gas tanks. It lasted about 2 days filming there with longest day being 16 hours. Each time they have these shots go, they would sometimes even rearrange us in different spots trying to get the best shot.  
Wow, did you enjoy the filming process?  
At times it could get real boring, a lot of sitting around and waiting can happen while rehearsals can also take a majority of time, even deciding who gets the blank guns and who gets the rubber guns. I always wanted the rubber gun cause that meant you would get shot and would have to die on screen which means a chance of getting to see it on film. I got one of those scenes on film in the archives portion.  
I was an extra in the James Bond film Goldeneye (1995) as a soldier.
What was the pay like?  
So for the 2 or 3 days of filming on the gunfight in the interior of the chemical plant I made around 150 pounds and filming at the archives came to 200 pounds since it took much longer to shoot there then the chemical plant as that had more stunts and blanks to be fired as well as your close ups.

what was it like on set on goldeneye? was it like a normal wokplace with watercooler talk and could you somehow show yourself in one of the clips? :)  
The moments when we had to pay attention to what we had to do in order not to spoil the shot was when we had to buckle down and listen to what the director, stunt choreographer wanted us to do. Besides that when we had to await for them to set the scene up, a lot of guys would indeed go out the back of the studio outside to take smoke and tea breaks and indeed have talks over random stuff. It was very professional work but also relaxed to work around an action movie. I really enjoyed it, and if I find myself in the scene which won't be too hard I'll throw it in the reddit.  
sound awsome, and also, when was the filming done, and was smoking still common then?

3 questions  1-how old were you when you were part of the movie? 2-Why did you stopped acting? 3- How much you earn being the manager of a furtniture store?  
Good questions. 1.) I was 25 years old when filming started, I was officially accepted into a role around early December of 94' and started my scenes early February of 95. 2.) I've hit that point of my life where I was young, and I always wanted to be an actor, and after those 2 movies I have done it. Not sure how common people might have this, but when I finally got to be what I wanted to be, I simply didn't want to do it no more. Not that I didn't like it or that it didn't pay the bills, it's just that I simply was satisfied that I got to make my dream a real thing and I was ready to move on from it. 3.) I make about 40,000 pounds a year, but I live in London so it can get expensive.

Goldeneye, Die Another Day and Skyfall (to the surprise of many) were my top 3 Bond films. As a child, I actually knew the release order of every Bond film, the actor of each Bond, the plot, the villain and had a book of Bond quotes. I knew how the villain died in each film. I loved Bond films.  How did they fake the tanks falling on you? Were they just giant inflatables?

How does the main character always have unlimited ammo?   
Because he's James Bond! Buy if you want a real logical answer, it's because of pacing. For most action films you don't want to have the main character stop to reload when in the scene the protagonist has to be flying through when the audience needs to feel that speed so they do that in order to keep pacing in the film. I know of some cool scenes that got cut from the film because of pacing.

Actually used to play the game on n64.  How many of those soldiers were actual russians? Where was the bunker filmed?  
Absolutely none of those soldiers in the film were anywhere near as Russian ad the vodka martinis Bond drinks in Monte Carlo. Every last one of them was an Englishman, Scotsman or Irish man And the bunker was a separate set constructed and filmed for the scenes of the movie. I never went to the set, but from what I heard the few soldier extras that ported to the scene told me that it was defiantly cool.

Not to get personal, but what does an extra make on a film of that caliber?   
Unfortunately it's not a living, but for the amount of time and days I worked to earn it, it was a lot for its time. Each scenes I filmed I made over a hundred pounds, I wrote the exact prices on other questions before.

What made you decided to stop pursuing acting as a career? How is life after the role?   
I basically just hit that point of my life where I simply didn't want to do it anymore. I didn't stop liking it, I just felt satisfied that I got to be an actor, and be in a Bond film of all movies. Really really fortunate and wouldn't trade a bloody thing for the experience, but when I didn't want to do it anymore I just moved on. After the role though I felt right back into looking for a part, but eventually just left it a few months later after that. I think have I remained, the next film I may have had a shot at bring an extra in was a Liam Neeson movie, I can't remember the name of it at the top of my head but last I remembered was that it was being filmed in Ireland. Somebody the extras after principal photography told me they were hearing small hints of that being tossed around and voiced they were gonna head there after Goldeneye.

What was it like shooting the scene where Bond has to slowly move the cart before jumping onto the conveyor belt? Did the wheels actually squeak at all? Were there multiple takes? I bet that could've gotten incredibly tedious to shoot considering that all the soldiers had to be focused while the main character covers a wide distance very slowly... And something I've always been extremely curious about: do you happen to recall what the intention was for when General Omurov shoots Sean Bean's character in the head? Was everyone aware on the set that in the story, the gun would be filled with blanks? I adore GoldenEye but I've always felt like that scene was slightly cheap, they really do make it seem like he was killed, only for him to magically reappear later.. Thanks so much for doing this AMA! edit: missed a word  
Good questions right there. So the wheels on the cart actually didn't squeak, I'd imagine that was done on post after principal photography was finished. And it wasn't as tideous as it may have appear to been, but we did multiple takes so they can get the different angles of the scene which included on the scaffolding and looking up at the extras on the stairs. On the scaffolding, we had Brosnan actually behind the cart, but when it came to the shot of just the extras with their weapons trained on him, instead they had one of the production staff hold up I believe a piece of cardboard or something else random slowly walking to the right and they were told to just aim their guns on that large mock target and told to keep their sights on it until cut. We did about 7 takes if I remember until Martin got the shots he wanted. As for Orumov actually shooting Sean in the script, I believe when I remembered in the script it just called that Orumov fires his gun after called For England James and then we were to fire our guns when Bond runs back for cover. I wasn't fully aware of the story when I first got the script, but I heard it being tossed around during breaks on set that Sean was suppose to live because he's a famous actor, killing him off in the first 10 minutes of the film would just be silly. But we also had the intention that he would be the important part of the story in the movie.

How long were you on the set vs actually in position for filming?  
So I remember the longest day of shooting lasted for 16 hours, we were to arrive at 0700 for wardrobe fitting cause depending on the scene we are filming ot could take an hour to get everyone dressed and the actors arrived thirty minutes after. Film crew and production staff would already be there an hour before us at like 0600, but the director Martin I remembered was always the very first one there. Even production staff who told me that they show up at their earliest at like 0530 just so they could have a kettle going would find Martin already there at his production desk with a little light working on the storyboard. He worked hard but in the end he got a great film.  When we filmed, it can go for about usually only a few seconds at a time before cutting and having to take like 30 minutes to restage everyone, reload weapons with more blanks if necessary and other things like that.

That was my first Bond movie I ever saw. Then the video game came out and cemented me as a lifelong Bond fan. I've watched Goldeneye more than 25 times growing up. It's still one of my favorites.      I don't really have a question but I guess I would ask: why are the voices not synced in this movie? It is especially noticeable with General Ourumov.

Did you receive any training on how to avoid hitting anyone with a firearm?  
With the blank guns, we were given more of a firearms safety lecture rather than an actual shooting class. Simple training like don't aim the gun at anything you don't intend to shoot or if the script doesn't call for it, always only charge the weapon when the director called for it which meant we were ready to film.  
I honestly didn't expect a serious reply to my snark about bad guys always missing the protagonist, lol. Thanks for answering, tho.

Joe Rogan claimed people who want to become actors do so because they seek the attention they never received as a child. Would you agree?

Can you show us, who you were in the scenes? Or would you perfer your face to be private?

Do you know if the character you played had a name? Or was it just something like "background soldier #47" Are there any skills that transfer between extra acting and furniture store managing?

Do you have any advice for the younger generation? I‚Äôm sure throughout your 81 years you‚Äôve faced hardships in life. How did you overcome them? Thank you for your service, sir!  
My advice is to make the most of every day. The thing that sucks about being old is you think about what you did when you were young. Now, I'm happy with the choices that I have made, and I wouldn't change it for anything. But when your my age hopefully you can look back at your life and have no regrets. What is important is that you take care of the people that love you. When I was 79 I lost my wife we had been married for 53 years. Losing her was something that changed me. When my great-nephew moved here things became better for me and I recovered. Just appreciate your loved ones. Coming to Los Angeles in 1958 by myself was hard. I figured out very quickly in you want to feel safe and secure all you need is at least one good friend.  
 you want to feel safe and secure all you need is at least one good friend.  Really great words of wisdom

good afternoon sir!  first let me thank for your service to our country! thank you! you're amazing!  second! I have a 2015 Ford Taurus limited all wheel drive in my drive way it's the best car I've ever owned, as a proper vehicle owner, we have named her Elizabeth  (I wanted Betty after Betty white but we compromised on Elizabeth she is a queen after all).  my question is, as an 81 year old and veteran, how do you feel about the state of the united states right now? thank you! xoxoxo

What advice would you give a 16 year old in high school?  
If you want to go to college start applying for scholarships now. Do things for yourself, not for other people. If you want children please wait until you have the financial means to do so. Except for a mortgage try to avoid car loans. They have changed in the 60 years and I don't think that buying a 40,000 dollar car is worth it. At this point it is better to buy used. Also, vote in every election, not just for president. Pay attention to the midterm election and know who you want representing you. \ Have a good one!

So what kind of car or cars do you have now?  
I own a 5 cars 1963 Ford galaxie 2dr, a 1965 mustang convertible, a 1968 Mercury  Cougar, 1977 ford Bronco and a 2010 f-150 truck, I had a 66 Ford Thunderbird but I gave it away to my nephew. Except the truck, I designed at least one thing on the older cars that I have and I bought them new when they came out. Because I was a Ford employee I had major discounts back in the day.  
That are some beautiful cars! I'm jealous :)

If you were in a war, what was it like coming back and seeing everything had changed? Also what changed the most in you lifestyle once you came back from the army?  
I was a mechanic, so I wasn't on the front lines as some other soldiers where, but I did have some encounters where I almost lost my life. When I came Back to the US I started college. I moved from Michigan to California, so the major change for me was moving to a place that had a lot more people that my hometown and where I knew no one. The hustle and bustle city was hard. Having no relatives in my area or friends at first proved to be even harder.  
Can you tell us about the time where you almost lost your life, or would you rather not?

Thank you for your service!  What is the craziest experience from your Navy days?  
Thank you! the craziest experience that I had was hitting rough waves and fell overboard with 4 others. I thought that I was going to die but thankfully we where spotted and they hoisted us up. Also, two guys in our squad were gay. I caught them having sex in the bushes. I didn't care so when they wanted to bang I covered for them. We all remained friends and they where still together when they died.

I have a question about the Navy. I have interest about joining ever since I was 14 . What's it like being  in the Navy ?  
It depends on what job you want and your test scores.  Mostly it's just traveling from my experiences. For awhile I was in the center of the battle so it can be scary. If you get a college degree you can join as an officer. Think ahead about what job you want in the Navy and relate your degree to that or just prepare for the test.

/u/bisfitty, your responses to the questions are witty and fantastic.  Have to say this is the best AMA I have read in a long time. I must be your friend now. Also, Did they offer you anything other than an "I'm sorry, and so-and-so has been let go"?  
I got a promotion, a raise, and better bennies. I also think I hold this golden ticket that means I can do no wrong, lol. "BisFitty, your TPS reports are not up to par" "Yeah, well, remember that time I was expected to be a slave?"  
I love what you did, OP. Better pay and bennies are great, but continue to work hard and treat people right, and even greater things well happen. There's no replacement for hard work, and ANYONE can be replaced.   
Oh yeah, totally. This won't change who I am. Im a hard worker by nature, I enjoy accomplishing tasks and reaching goals.

Anything you planned for the party that you missed out on? I would have paid to see you surprise a Confederate officer. Funniest/most clever thing I've seen on Reddit yet. Well done.  
That would be it. There was a super old couple, New England transplants from the south, who came with Confederate Officer uniforms, and were really proud of them. They kept talking it up, and were probably the most excited, out of everyone in attendance, about the ball. After my reveal with the chick in the dress, they avoided me like the plague (the black one) and their uniforms were never seen.

How did the idea pop in your head? Was it immediately when you heard the location/theme of the retreat and party? Did your wife try to talk you out of it?  
Yeah, it was THE second I read the theme. I was like "Really? Well, I guarantee this means they forgot about me again." Wife was a little afraid I would get us in trouble, but we agreed that it would be okay as long as I didn't (like I planned to) make a nametag that said: MY NAME IS: Kunta Kinte TOBI  
Django? Honestly the only thing funnier than what you did was if you would have wore this http://www.cosplayhouse.com/images/D/Django-Unchained-Django-Blue-Suit-Cosplay-Costume-Version-01-002.jpg  
This has been said by many people. As I pointed out, the retreat was mostly older white people, who have not seen that movie. To any older white person who has not seen that movie, that costume, especially on someone light skinned such as myself, would simply be mistaken for Prince. I would rather be mistaken for "El Negro Baggins" than Prince.

I really loved this saga, you also have the stoic face of a man who knows exactly what he's doing and is having the most fun with it.  How long did it take for anyone to notice? Like did some other person notice before that woman and have a chuckle, or was it a pretty immediate thing? Also, what do you think the Buzzfeed headline for this is gonna be?  
Noone saw me until I wanted them to. As I stated earlier... Buzzfeed's title will just be whatever they ripped from the top of the Tumblr posts, of course!  
Can't wait to see the "Buzzfeed has reached out to BisFitty for comment" at the end. Thanks again for being hilarious.

While I was laughing my ass off at your posts, how was the general reaction from everyone else in person who saw your (hilarious) costume set?  
The climate DEFINITELY got palpably stiff and awkward for the rest of the retreat. I was CLEARLY avoided, on more than on occasion. Apparently an off color person with matching humor was a bit much for them, lol.  
I had a hard time understanding when you put it on/take it off. It was a retreat and it seemed like before the lady put on her costume, you weren't wearing it constantly.  Follow-up question: were you clearly avoided after you took it off?   
I did not wear it the entire time, but I did wear it a lot. My position in the company doesn't really benefit from the breakout sessions that were available at the retreat. This left me with a LOT of free time on my hands. This, coupled with the fact that I tend to keep to myself in large social groups, meant I could EASILY keep myself from being seen until I wanted to be. Oh yeah, there was some DEFINITE avoidance going on! lol

Were there any of your coworkers at the party that didn't actively avoid you, or was the white guilt simply too strong?  
I have a few people in the company I would consider close friends. They all thought it was HILARIOUS and were pretty bummed that the party ended up being cancelled. They were also looking forward to me fucking with the Confederate officers in attendance!

On a scale of Canada to lost-every-shred-of-dignity, how apologetic were they?  
Is "SUPER CANADA" an option? I am now the only employee who gets to decide if something like this is mandatory for me, I was given a minor increase in job responsibility, that comes with a disproportionate raise. "Not because of this or anything... You just do great work and it's been a long time coming." You know what they say about correlation =/= causation and all...  
Oh man they are so scared you are going to sue them. I think you're handling this very gracefully, you're not naming the company, you are apparently still willing to continue working with them. It seems like they are more ignorant than actually racist?  
I got a promotion, a raise, and better bennies... All shit I've been wanting for a while, but wasn't getting. Really, at this point, me quitting would be as monumentally stupid as them firing me would be, lol

I think what you did was far more effective than just bitching to HR, which never accomplishes anything (seriously, I don't believe they would have canceled the venue if you had complained beforehand, they would have just tried to "address your concerns).   On a scale from 1 to 100, how gleeful are you right now?    
Got a promotion and a raise. I also work from home so I'm about420gleefulrightnow  
This is thread is destined for a bunch of news sites now, OP. You might live to regret that answer...  
As I've said earlier, the company knows I smoke. They don't care what you do as long as you perform well for the company. But again, thank you, good lookin out.

What would you have done if your costume didn't phase anyone or they didn't Super Canada apologize?  
Idk... find a new job? lol In all seriousness, I am a top performer in the company who, until now, keeps all of my shenanigans segregated separate from work. There was little to no reason for me to get in trouble at all, let alone get canned.

Have they offered any explanation for the party theme, or acknowledged anything they will do differently to be more aware of their shitty shitty ideas?  
They canned the chick who came up with the theme (because she was HR, pretty big fuckup on her part) and apologized profusely  
Did you know the HR chick before this all went down?    
A little bit, not really. She's a few years younger than me... A bit of a SJW, that likes to take PC shit too far. How THIS seemed like a good idea to her I'll surely never fucking know!

Were you actually upset and did it to prove a point? Or did you just see it as an opportunity to bring some humor to the situation while subtly showing your company how ludicrous the idea was? Basically wondering if your motives were for social justice or for the laughs

Where did you came up with the idea to be a party slave   
I am the only black employee, and I am often forgotten about. The moment I saw the theme of the party, I realized I had once again been overlooked... Im thinking this may be the last time that happens, lol  
The fact that you were overlooked in this planning is probably a pretty good sign that your company is more oblivious than racist.  
I am BisFitty, the "period appropriate" corporate costume party slave... AMAA
This is gonna look great on that HR persons resume: "So, why did you leave your previous job?" "Oh I set up a slave owner themed party at a company with a single black employee..."  
"That was YOU??? Holy shit!!! JENKINS, GET IN HERE! You remember that 'corporate party slave' fiasco we were glad wasn't us? THIS is the bitch to thank for the whole thing!!!!.... Naw lady, we can't give you the job, but SHIT, that was some great shit!"

She was pretty horrified. She seemed to no longer feel comfortable in the outfit she chose. She mingled with people for only like 2 or 3 minutes more after that, then had to excuse herself for some "emergency." After that, I didn't see her again, and NOONE saw her dress again, lol

How does it feel to work for a company that doesn't see race, because they're all white enough to not worry about it?  
Before, it felt like nothing, now that I have had the opportunity to troll the fuck out of them for it, I'm walkin on cloud 9, I feel like the fucking KING... not the REAL king, /u/Here_Comes_The_King, but still!

Congrats on the promotion. This whole saga has been absolutely hilarious. Did your wife find this as funny as we all did?  
Oh yeah she did! She was the one who set "Dress Chick" up for the reaction photos, lol "Oh your dress is SOOOO pretty, I need to get a pic!"  She is my #1 P.I.C.!

Is this plantation used as an event space normally?  How many "period themed" outings do you think they have hosted over the years?   The whole story reminded my of when Paula Deen got in hot water a couple of years back when it came out she planned a "period appropriate" wedding at a plantation.   I am astounded on how tone death people still can be.  I see that someone has lost their job but the amount of permissions and sign offs to book this event tells me that at least 10 other people didn't see this as a problem.    
Yeah, it's, more often than not, a wedding venue, for antebellum themed weddings... Maybe I should contact the owner about a job helping everything feel a little more... authentic.  
I am BisFitty, the "period appropriate" corporate costume party slave... AMAA
I'm a little confused with the story. Why was this party at a plantation? I've never heard of such a thing before.  
I'm a little confused with the story. Why was this party at a plantation? I've never heard of such a thing before.  
Yes, it was. Apparently now that all the field machinery has been "emancipated," they rent out these properties as private venues for weddings, retreats, what the hell ever. They just wanna make some damn money. I'm not hating.

Oh fuck, "field machinery" is killing me. As someone else said you need to write a book, or a script treatment for a comedy show.

What percent of the people at the party would you say found your costume funny or at least were not made visibly uncomfortable by it?  
Ummmm, I guess like, the 15-20% of the people there, who know me and my sense of humor.  
Oh, wow, that's actually a lot more than I expected! Too bad more people didn't have a good sense of humor about it, though.  
Keep in mind, that percentage comes out to about 5 or 6 people, out of the 25-30 that were there.

Have any of the media outlets contacted you to promote your story? Would you consider going national, or are you not looking for that kind of publicity against your job?   
I am BisFitty, the "period appropriate" corporate costume party slave... AMAA
What's your actual profession? How many people attended and did no one else see the humor in this?  
The first question falls a bit too close to what Im not supposed to answer, hence the Ask Me Almost Anything, sorry. There were about 25-35 people at the party, and about 5 or 6 of them found it hilarious, those are the people that are closest to my age and the ones I tend to hang out with at these types of functions, I was not surprised by their reactions. The older crowd was NOTICEABLY shaken (not stirred) and was trying to avoid me for the rest of the time there. As more people realized that the weather was likely not the real reason the party was cancelled, the whispers started, lol  
I am BisFitty, the "period appropriate" corporate costume party slave... AMAA
What is your favorite type of food? Also my non redditor SO wanted me to tell you that she thought this was one of the best things she has seen on the internet. I am to tell you that she admires your great sense of humor.   
I am BisFitty, the "period appropriate" corporate costume party slave... AMAA
Clearly, from the images of your hater messages, what were your thoughts going into this endeavor? Like, was it your goal to call out HR and the company for not considering your race when making this decision, or did you just want to rustle some jimmies and get some giggles out of the situation?  
More of the latter. If I wanted the party cancelled, I would have made a big deal about it ahead of time. Thrown some race cards or some shit (if I can find out who sells them). My main goal was to expose how ridiculous the entire idea was, and rustle some jimmies by reminding them that the big plantation house and antebellum balls were only possible due to the work, and deaths, of people of color.  
I am BisFitty, the "period appropriate" corporate costume party slave... AMAA
Did the person who came up with the idea provide any defense of the theme? Also, of the people who came in "Civil War Reenactor" gear, were any dressed as Northerners?  
In the interest of complete fairness, the Confederate Officers did bring union uniforms as well, for other people to wear. They are civil war reenactors, so this is basically a party they have been preparing for for years lol HRAsstDir had no defense, at least not on the call I was a part of. Her and the boss are in the office, in New England, so they could have had a lot of conversation that I was not privy to.

This AmAA has been lots of fun for me.  As soon as I saw your first photo the other day, I was dying laughing.  Go YOU! My questions:  Nitpicky, and unimportant they are.  I see it was a work event.  Did you wife attend with you? Did she come just to the Costume Ball? Who took the photos of you?  They look professional.  That added to my enjoyment of the entire episode.  EDIT:  I was just enjoying a review of your post, and the first photo says "My wife and I attended..." So, nevermind my stupid questions.  
I am BisFitty, the "period appropriate" corporate costume party slave... AMAA
I shouldn't laugh but I'm going to because this is fucking awesome!  How excited/upset were you when deciding on that costume? Was the cotton soft? I've never seen it like that. Who's the lady in #6? People's reactions! Did they see you and go, "Oh shit, HR is gunna have fun with this!" or more, "Hey, I think I heard the wind outside. Let's go see the wind." Would you ever wear that costume not at a corporate retreat set in a time period appropriate southern Alabama plantation? Favorite brand of coffee?   
1) I probably could not have been more excited! The only thing that made me happier, was finding the pieces to my costume for onder $20! 2) First person to ask this one! While the cotten if kind of soft, its not like you are used to. It was a little scratchy, and the seeds arer big and sharp, I can honestly see why they could not pay anyone enough to pick the shit. 3) The woman in #6 is one of the few people who knew what I was doing ahead of time. She is a really good friend of ours, and has akick ass sense of humor. That old lady is a fuckin trip! 4) Reactions were mixed, but overall uncomfortable. A couple people (my closest friends in the company) loved it and were looking forward to seeing how uncomfortable it would make the older crowd. 5) Mayble, lol... idk... Satan's pretty cool! 6) I'll drink any coffee, but my favorite is currently the whole bean Kona I get from The Fresh Market. Great questions!

I hope this isn't too late for an answer, but you were at this conference with colleagues for at least 2-3 days before the party event, and none of your colleagues  cottoned on that the party was even slightly inappropriate? And those 2 gentlemen with confederate uniforms bragged about their costumes while you were within eyesight? Wow. Even as an Australian I could see all the wrong. Ps. I followed this from your first post and absolutely love your sense of humour. You sure you aren't part Aussie?

Sure you couldn't be tempted to put a word in to show some mercy for this fired person? A sacking like this could be potentially life ruining, and all in the name of making her a scapegoat for a fuck up that there was no malice behind, and no one got hurt because of. In fact her fuck up appears to have benefited you significantly. Perhaps ask them to offer her a resignation with a good reference so this doesn't tank her career?  
I truly fail to see how, firing the HR rep who came up with the idea is scapegoating. We are talking about someone who prides herself in being a super PC SJW nazi, apparently it doesn't come into play when it would actually, ya know... matter, lol

I'd say it's scapegoating because the people above her clearly approved of this idea also, and had plenty of time to see how stupid it was, but failed to. Does she actually pride herself in being a super PC SJW nazi? Then I'd certainly lean towards firing her, but that's probably more to do with people like that annoying me than it being a fair response to a victim and malice free oversight.  
Yuuuuuup, she's one of those whose FB is nothing but links to her PC NAZI SJW bullshit. It's 100% who she identifies as, and anyone who doesn't agree is basically a cisgendered shitlord who needs to check their privilege.

Have you ever been in a fist fight? How'd it go? Have you ever had a paranormal experience? Or something that you cannot explain.  
I have, to both of those. The fistfight I'd say I won. This old lady spit on me and threw her cigarette butt at my face so I superman punched her. Old lady or not I'm fucking you up for something like that. She ended up having to have surgery on her jaw. It was broke in a couple spots. Still dont feel bad.  At 16 some friends and I went spooking at the old haunted bridge, go to the bridge turn the far off, wait and see what happens. A light started coming up the road. A singular light, thought it was a motorcycle so we go to start the car because we are in the person's way and the car wouldnt start and then it started shaking. We turned around and the light was right on is. Not a motorcycle just like a glowing orb. We took the fuck off and made our friends dad go get her car. Never fucked with any of that since.  
The light might of been a Ball Lighting

I feel bad for the lady. Are you a Male? How old were you? Were you criminally charged? Did she sue you?  
I am a female. I was 20 at the time. My sons dad had gotten remarried, the old lady in question was her mother. I went to his house to retrieve things he broke into my house and stole, he told me to come and when I got there the ex, new wife, and MIL all come at me. As soon as she spit on me and threw the cigarette I saw red and went nuts. I may have won that victory but when my ex got me off of her he  broke my collarbone, four ribs and stomped on me so hard with his boots I had literal bruises in the shape of boot prints for 2 months. That was the last time he ever put his hands on me though. The police said if I charged him for that she was charging me, and I would have had a felony charge and I had never been in trouble so I let it go. She never sued me either.

How will karma get you a computer? Also have you tried asking your work to provide it or at least pay up front and then take the money off your first check?  
I asked the recruiter that reached out if there was any assistance for this. She said that it was my responsibility to have it in order to start the job. They will not provide it. It's a bigger company that is outsourcing for work from home jobs right now and seeing as how its temporary unless they want to keep you afterwards, they dont want to pay to supply that knowing you may not stay.  The karma will allow me to post in said group and ask for assistance.  
Which group?

Posting in free karma subs and asking for votes is called KARMA-FARMING.  That is against the rules in r/assistance and most other  assistance-style subreddits. It will disqualify you from posting a request there and even get you banned.  How do I know this?  I am the head mod at r/assistance. I suggest you cease this activity immediately!

If they gave you the job it‚Äôs their responsibility to provide a computer.  
This is not true. I have had work at home jobs and none ever provided a computer. Customer service, tech support, teaching English, all I had to have my own computer and headset

Really? The job description says you have to provide that so I figured it was just part of the requirements  
My brother in law works for a call center. They literally took two monitors and a desktop to work from home  
That's exactly what I need, i just dont have a way to fund it right now. Or anyone to ask for help from. I'm really not even asking for the money, like sure that would be the quickest way but even resources on where to find them or if there is programs to help would be cool.

Have you checked with your local Goodwill? They have might have a laptop you can have for free or cheap. Also check Facebook market place, letgo, and other such places. You could probably get a laptop for around $100. Otherwise consider getting a cheap tower and use your television as your monitor.  Towers tend to be cheaper than laptops anyway.

It was definitely a struggle, very few pros and a metric fuck tonne of cons. I'll go over the pros firs, because they're fewer and easier to list:  I got really good at basketball. It's one of the only things to do in there, so I played it a lot.  Believe it or not, they had consoles - an original xbox, to be exact. It was given to the good behavior kids when they were, well, being well behaved. Being a suburban, sheltered school kid, I had no problem doing that so I ended up with it a lot of the time. I got ripped. As. FUCK. Working out was one of the few forms of entertainment, so I did a lot of it and came out carved from wood. Not the case anymore, but once upon a time I had a six pack.  Cons:  I got the shit kicked out of me on a regular basis. This was mostly due to what I was in there for, but being a smart kid, and a smart arse to boot, among others who didn't come from the same kind of background lead to a lot of... conflict. My schooling went to hell - I was mid year 11 when I went in and while I tried to keep it up, I don't think I need to describe how hard it would be to concentrate on studies in an environment like that. I didn't feel safe - ever. Even when guards were around, half the guards were an absolute pack of cunts or just lazy, so their presence wasn't a guarantee of safety. Sometimes the guards themselves just made your life hard, because they could. (Not to say they were all this way, there were some absolute champs too) I changed a lot as a person. This is probably the biggest one, because it wasn't just a slight personality change. Apart from all the bad habits and slang and everything else I picked up (I would spit, randomly, for months after I got out), I just grew up faster than I should have and not all at once. By the time I came out, I had the cynicism and bitterness of a fifty year old with the world experience of, well, a teenager. The few years after were spent mostly just figuring out how I was supposed to act.

I've had professional help in the past, though it wasn't something I was quick to. For a really, really long time I refused to believe that I had any kind of lasting issues from it all. Eventually I gave in when I started to self-destruct and was diagnosed with Major Recurrent Depression and Panic Disorder. It was absolutely worth going to see someone, it put a lot of things in perspective even if I was the one doing most of the talking.

How do you feel and react when you deal with police and other people in authority after all of this?   
I'm not gonna lie, I have a lot of authority issues - I don't have a problem with people telling me what to do, but I tend to get agitated when I'm "told" to do something. I'm also aware not all police are bent assholes, but I can't help but be anything but cold at best towards them when dealing with them, if not outright derisive.

Were you ever raped or sexually assaulted to any degree in prison?  
No - you'll find that kids generally aren't capable of that sort of thing. They just don't have the capacity for that much evil and it's pretty rare that they do. Punches to my face were enough for me, apparently.

Absolutely, stuff like that doesn't stay secret for long. When I arrived, I was told by the guards to keep mum and make up a story about how I'd stolen a car. A few days after I'd arrived, however, my charge sheet was left somewhere for a group of inmates on cleanup duty to see and that kind of sealed my fate. Make no mistake: Thieves, con-artists, murderers - these are nothing compared to sexual crimes in the eyes of most criminals and they take a huge exception to it. I got the shit kicked out of me on a fairly regular basis, though there were others who believed me that helped me out as well. The name "rapist" was something I heard every day, it was pretty hard to deal with.

What do you think the punishment for false rape accusations should be? Also, I hope all goes well for you after this negative experience.  
What do you think the punishment for false rape accusations should be? Also, I hope all goes well for you after this negative experience.  
Well it was ten years ago, just about, so I can say for sure that things have turned out pretty good. As for what should happen to people who lay false rape charges? I guess the same as the punishment for bringing false charges of any kind. I used to have a lot of really strong opinions about this issue and if you'd asked me right after it happened, I probably would've been happy to see her swing. These days, I guess I've just let a lot of it go and don't think about it so much. I don't really know a lot about her situation either, now or back then - kind of half the problem with our system and the way it works. Might've been crazy, could've just had absolutely no understanding of the gravity of what she was accusing me of - a lot of things. At the same time, she was also a teenager when this all happened and I've always believe that teenagers do stupid teenager shit and sometimes it gets out of hand. I don't think there's an easy answer to that question.

 I guess the same as the punishment for bringing false charges of any kind.   I don't think you get it man, or you have some aversion to face it. Falsely accusing someone of rolling a stop ($20 ticket) and raping someone (maybe 40 years in prison if your judge skipped breakfast that morning and the ages of the participants are right) should not have the same penalty.  I guess I've just let a lot of it go  And, sorry to say this, she's laughing at you every day, and the system is setup and probably incarcerating a bunch of "I didn't do it" teens who are guilty and will never get someone to recant their lie. You should reconsider this. As one (uneducated) redactor says "you sound so level headed" - no, it's all to do with application of one's self, not exactly lazy, but we adapt and do the minimum to make us happy most of the time. This wouldn't be easy and it would dredge up a lot, but it's easy to think this is "letting it go" rather than "facing up to it". Don't worry about this comment, the hand-wringing conflict averse subhuman culture of reddit will down vote it.

I guess everyone has some kind of revenge fantasy that they think about after shit like this happens, but it was never something I thought about seriously. I'd already been in jail for something I hadn't done, didn't want to be in there again for something I had. Because it happened before I was 18, it never comes up for jobs because it's a sealed record. I wasn't actually convicted, either, so at most all that would ever show up would be charges (still not desirable, but I guess better than the alternative?) That said, nothing ever would.  I did lose a couple of friends over this, some who thought I'd genuinely done it, others who weren't sure, others still who'd been questioned by the police because of it and just didn't like that, thus they stopped liking me. I haven't had them come back and try to talk to me about it since, but that's okay I guess - everyone needs to look out for themselves and I wouldn't want to force someone to hang around me if it made them uncomfortable.

What changes to the system do you think would help people in cases like yours? And do you hold any resentment against the prosecutors?    
I think there are a lot of changes which need to happen and a big part of it is social perception. I would agree that there's a presumption of innocence in Australia, but it goes out the window when rape charges are laid. It's because there's a perception that men are automatically guilty in situations like this and everything, including how the investigation is carried out, is based around this idea and that the woman is absolutely a victim who needs to be protected. For instance: Photos of my genitalia were take and displayed in the court room during my trial as evidence, whereas nurse "sketches" of her body were able to be submitted the same way. Total strangers, my family, the prosecution, the judge, were all staring at pictures of my teenage junk (which didn't prove anything, btw), but only sketches of her body could be allowed because of this perception that I was already guilty.

Every time you hear of a rape allegation in the news, what do you hate the most?  i.e. do you hate that people try to form conclusions off of finite public knowledge?  
This is actually a really good question, because you know what? My first thought isn't immediately "I wonder if he did it?" it's "Sounds like a scumbag." It isn't until I actually force myself to remember that I went through similar shit that I consider that every situation isn't so simple.  It's kind of fucked up and I'll always have the time of day for people who were in my same situation, but I guess it's kind of telling that I can go through that and then still think that way.

Did anyone believe you didn't do it?  
I think there might've been a brief period immediately after the dust had cleared where probably everyone thought I might have done it. Talking to and dealing with my family at that point was pretty hard and I felt pretty alone. I guess it wasn't until enough time had passed, and people who knew me could see that I wasn't any different, before people made up their minds. When I was inside, the people I spent my days with all had differing opinions, many of which were pretty straight up told to my face. Followed by fists. I know there were people who believed me, but because of the situation and the shitty system they couldn't really say as much. Was bad times.

If you see her again, what would you do? Forgive her? Give her a piece of your mind? Or what?  
Funnily enough, I did see her again one day about four years back - it was while I was at work and I had a panic attack. It took me a really long time to come to terms with all of it - I'd even go so far as to say that the relatively good place I've found myself in today has been a "recent" thing. If I met her again today? I dunno - I can say, though, that I'd be happier to just never run into her again and let it all stay in the past.  
Good for you mate. There was a girl in foster care whose family moved in next to me a few years ago. We hit it off, eventually went out. Then she started just messing with my head, got into a bunch of trouble, and left. Six months later her foster dad comes round to carefully let me know she'd said that I raped her when she went back home, but that nobody had believed her and it wasn't being pressed or anything. Ngl, it's nowhere near what you had, but thinking about how easily you lost a year of your life, does make me uneasy. I remember thinking if I ever saw her again I wouldn't have any feelings towards her, not violence or hatred, just emptiness. Because if somebody is going to lie about that they're not a person. They're an insect and they're beneath you in every way.  
I feel you man, but it's worth thinking about it from their perspective as well because it can help. Being a foster kid, I can only imagine what issues she'd be dealing with. Not to justify false claims of rape - because, no - but if only for your own thinking, it can help to consider what the other person was thinking. Good to hear nothing came of it though!

How did she react to seeing you again? And was the panic attack immediate, or did it take some time to sink in?  
I don't know how she reacted, though I'm sure I saw recognition in her eyes. I bailed into the backroom of that job pretty quickly and just freaked out, so I guess you'd say it was pretty immediate.

What are the lasting effects this has had on your life after leaving prison and being exonerated?  
When I got out, the feeling of freedom was almost tangible - I wasn't just out of jail, but I wasn't in school anymore either and I wasn't working. I had absolutely nothing holding me down and it was pretty uplifting for awhile. When reality came crashing in, I realised I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do with myself and my old life was pretty much in tatters. I started work full time and, after awhile, I figured out I wanted to write and now I do that for a Perth gaming site. Also: It should be noted I wasn't exonerated, I was only acquitted - they're not the same thing. The first would require the police and the DPP to admit they fucked up, lied, pretty sure some of the stuff they did were actual crimes, etc..

Do you feel that your interactions with the opposite sex have been affected by your experience?  
Yeah, definitely for awhile after - I don't want to say I was "scared" of women, but I was certainly afraid of being alone with a woman. That's probably the biggest issue, it was a case of mistrust for a really long time. I've never resented or hated women as a result of it, though, and I know that women lying about rape can be just as big an issue for women as it is for men.  
When I was 18 I was accused of rape.  2 days before I left for college I spent my first night ever with a "friend" and when I left she accused me to her ex and then other people of rape.  Together they got other people to believe them and I just broke down.  I was 4 hours away from everyone I cared about in a dorm room believing they all thought I raped someone, it was by far the worst experience of my life. Since then every time I get into a situation where I'm about to have sex I just shut down, run away and it has not happened since.  That was 10 years ago. edit:  I have not thought about this in a while, but it makes me shake just thinking about it now.

How do you feel about this comment from /u/Qbenbee?  Lying is bad and all but it wasn't her that forcibly held this boy against his will for a year, that was your government at work.

Well, they're a little flippant, but they're right. The public prosecution was pretty slimy in the way they dealt with the whole thing, which is to say nothing of the police investigation - though neither of those organisations would ever admit it. That said, while the government has issues of it's own to deal with, I don't think she should be completely discounted out of the equation here. She still did wrong, which lead to a shit situation - stuff doesn't just "happen," someone had to kickstart it somehow.  
She knew what she was doing she just didn't care Welcome to modern American women

How did it affect your long term prospects- education, job, etc? Did you end up getting any compensation from any party that wronged you? If so was it a fair amount? Or was it basically whoops we fucked up you and your whole family's life, tough shit (or not even get that much)?  
Actually worse than not getting that much, after I was released the director of the prosecution office went onto the news to say I was still a suspect. This was probably the worst part of the aftermath, because it was my parents that suffered more long-term impact than I did. As for my own prospects, they changed what I planned to do immediately but it didn't ruin my life. I wanted to be a teacher at one point in highschool, but I dropped that idea after all of this because I wasn't sure how it would effect me. I never ended up finishing highschool, either, I instead went into full time work and spent a few years figuring out what I wanted to do. These days I do amateur games journalism over at Gamecloud.net.au - it'd be nice to get paid for doing stuff like that one day.

How has the false accusation changed the way people view you now?  
I get a lot of the "poor you" stuff after most people here about it - it's not that I don't appreciate the sympathy and empathy, just that it gets tiresome hearing the same thing all the time, even if what you're hearing is support. These days, I don't actually bring it up so it's usually a surprise to people when they find out, though they're usually pretty good about it. At least as far as I've ever seen or heard, I've never met someone who disbelieved me. That, at least, I'm pretty thankful for.  
What, if anything, would you want to hear from people?  
I don't know, to be honest - for a long time I would just get pissed off at anyone that asked me anything about it. After awhile, I realised that people are just curious and they'll just respond however they respond - obviously, I'd prefer people to just not lose their shit and instantly think I'm some kind of deviant. If I had to pick ANYTHING, though - videogames. Find out something horrible happened to me? Give me a videogame. Videogames heal all. The world doesn't work like that, though - just don't flip out at me.  
I am the 15yo guy who was falsely accused of rape - AMAA
Mainly curious, did she ever say why she did this, or why she choose you?  
She changed her story two days before the trial to say that a second guy had raped her that night, not fifteen minutes before I was supposed to have done so. So... insanity? I never had a chance to speak to her and I've never looked for one, so I wouldn't be able to tell you for sure.  
You realize she did it all for money? You think her mother pressured her to do it? How much money did she make after all this?  
I am the 15yo guy who was falsely accused of rape - AMAA
Just wanted to say I had the same thing happen to me at 18, a good 10 years ago now and it fucking sucked even though I didn't go to jail (case never made it to court because there was no evidence). I did end up living on the streets for a period, which was shitty but i'm thankful that that was the worst of it. In cases such as these, what are your thoughts on the consequences for false accusers? My case was complicated as there was no admittance that the allegation was false (just a fuck-tonne of evidence) but I always thought that those who falsely accuse should be reprimanded accordingly.  
Yeah, I have a similar opinion in that people who lay false charges of any kind should be punished for it, just as the person they were laid against would've been punished for a crime they hadn't committed. That's just a matter of right and wrong, though, I don't think it'll fix this problem. I think it's more of a social issue and that we won't see actual change until people start changing the way they think about these issues.

In contrast, what would you say is the greatest thing that has happened in your life since being released?  
My fiancee would kill me if I didn't say getting engaged to her, but along side that would be the stuff I've been doing over at Gamecloud.net.au. Getting to write about video games in an official capacity, even if I'm not getting paid, is pretty rad.

Did your family ever come to doubt your innocence at all?  
Heya, I answered this in another question here, but short answer: I don't think so, no more than any normal person would be given pause for doubt. They were really amazing throughout the whole thing, I wouldn't have gotten through it without them.  
I am the 15yo guy who was falsely accused of rape - AMAA
Are there any counter claims you are going to pursue?  She really wrecked your entire family financially and emotionally.  
She did and it's something we pursued, but ultimately it'll never happen. Without going into a huge amount of detail, it would still cost us more to go after her and it's a very slim chance of anything happening (especially now, ten years later.) Additionally, the cops and prosecution would never admit to having fucked up, so there's that. It's a shitty reality of the system that stuff like this is easy to inflict on someone, but recourse when it's proven to be bullshit isn't really an option for those on the receiving end.  
I am the 15yo guy who was falsely accused of rape - AMAA
Why did you lie to the police and say that you had never met her before when in fact you had?   
I get this a lot and the answer is pretty simple: I was fucking terrified. Sometimes people don't get that and look for another reason, but that's honestly it - I'd never dealt with the police before, I knew that I was being questioned about something and they weren't telling me everything so I had no idea what to think. In my teenage mind, putting as much distance between the situation and myself was the sensible option.

What did you do for a year?  
I worked out. A lot. By the time I came out of there, I was the most fit I've ever been in my whole life. Of course, being in juvie for a year and then getting out suddenly meant I could eat all the junk food ever. My stomach never recovered.

What is your life like now? Have you found it difficult finding work? Do many people in your day to day life know you did time? Do they know it was for something you didn't do? How did being sent to prison as a teenager effect your education?   
I am the 15yo guy who was falsely accused of rape - AMAA
It's very hard for someone to remain remanded for almost one year as a juvenile, even if the alleged charges are horrific. Did you have any previous dealings with police that assisted in their remand application?  
Nope. I'd never spoken to the Police or been involved in any kind of investigation. The extended remand period is actually pretty easy to explain: We went for bail five times and we were knocked back the first four because of "new evidence" that the police would present at each hearing. The fifth and successful bail hearing came about because the girl was brought into the prosecutors office two days before the trial and changed her story. It really was just a case of the cops pulling dodgy shit to keep someone they didn't like where they wanted them to be.  
I don't see it as that dodgy. Until she changed her story and the DNA evidence came it, it didn't look that good for you. There were phone records between you, and CCTV footage showing someone matching your description following the girl from the train station she claimed to have been raped near. Why on earth did you lie about having called her? Had you not done that it's pretty likely that you wouldn't have been remanded.  
I am the 15yo guy who was falsely accused of rape - AMAA
Did you being innocent but still in prison make you think that maybe you weren't the only one? Did you give people the benefit of the doubt? Did other inmates who were sentenced for rape tell you they were innocent?  
There was only one other kid in there for sexual offences - he was eight and he was one of the scariest motherfuckers I have ever had the displeasure of meeting.  It was really difficult for me to empathise with anyone at that point, I was in such an alien environment. The stereotype of people being in prison having come from shit home backgrounds is, for the most part, actually kind of true. Conversely, I was a white kid from the 'burbs who was into videogames, D&D, and not having my head kicked in - I was in it for me, for the most part, and a lot of other people didn't get a second thought.  After the event, I certainly give people the benefit of the doubt when in similar situations, but it's not my first thought. It kind of sucks, but when you get back into the real world, you have a tendency to slip into the same sort of thinking as people around you.

If you had contact with your accuser would you have anything to say to her? If so, what?  
Not really - I've had all kinds of imaginary arguments and conversations in my head, all centered around exactly how that situation would go down. In the end I just decided I didn't care enough to seek it out, I don't think I'd get anything out of it and ultimately it'd probably just keep stressing me out about something I'd left behind me years ago now.

Any discussion about gender equality which starts from a basis of "I think everyone should follow my philosophy because the other gender is evil," isn't a discussion.

I'm a 21 YO redditor with stage 4 terminal cancer. AMA!
Anyone dying young is a tragedy, so I‚Äôm incredibly sorry for you and your family. Your willingness to do this AMA is admirable.  I have a small suggestion, which might be the ultimate gift to your family long after you‚Äôre gone. This was an idea I saw in an old movie.  There is an old 1993 movie (I‚Äôm in my mid 40‚Äôs) starring Michael Keaton called ‚ÄúMy Life‚Äù where he‚Äôs diagnosed with cancer and given 4 months to live. It‚Äôs an ugly-cry type movie. But he has young kids and gets a camcorder (remember it‚Äôs 1993) and starts recording parenting videos for his young kids‚Äîkind of a here are some tips on becoming a man later in life. I have 2 young sons and have always said I‚Äôd do the same thing should I suffer the same fate.  Take videos of yourself and take voice recordings of yourself talking to your parents/siblings/nieces/nephews. It doesn‚Äôt always have to be profound or sad, it could be reminiscing about old stories or reliving funny stories like the time your dad was trying to put the star on top of the Christmas tree, slipped and took the whole damn tree down. Maybe you record some future milestone videos like for when your sibling has a baby or for when your Dad retires.  I suggest this because I have a friend in their 40‚Äôs whose Dad died last year and they recently told me ‚ÄúI‚Äôd give anything to hear his voice again.‚Äù He has memories but longed just to hear his voice one more time. Our kids are supposed to bury us, not the other way around. Your parents will crave to hear your voice long after you are gone.  Damn, I‚Äôm tearing up just typing this. My best to you, young man, may your life be lived to the fullest, however long that may be.   
My mom died when I was 16, very quickly, of brain cancer. She didn't have time to do something like that, however there was an audio tape she had made at some sort of parent program at my school that they later gave me. The exercise was for the parents to say to the kids what they were proud of and what made thwm happy knowing about the kids. It is my single most important possession, and the thing I will take in a fire. This advice. Take it.

This is really a top comment. I'll definitely consider this, and I think it's so nice to give my loved ones the option to remember me positively. Thank you

This comment for real is the most amazing advice ever. I just lost my dad to cancer last year and I was 24 at the time. I still have some text messages of him being goofy but I lost the only sound of his voice I had that wasn‚Äôt his company phone voicemail. He had called me and left me a voicemail months before he died and left me a stupid joke as a voicemail, and as much as I thought it was dumb it was still his voice. It allowed me to laugh and hear his voice one more time in a relaxed setting, and then I got a new phone, and before I asked about it my phone got wiped and I lost his voice. That is the hardest thing. I would do anything to be able to hear his voice again, and to be able to raise my kids (when I have them) where they could at least hear his voice. Make the videos for your family, even if it‚Äôs hard for you or sad it‚Äôs okay because it will mean everything to them just to be able to hear your voice. I promise. I‚Äôm so sorry you have to deal with cancer because it‚Äôs terrible, enjoy your life though. My dad spent every day trying to laugh and make others laugh. Don‚Äôt lose who you are to the disgusting disease and just enjoy every day and the people around.  
This is really a top comment. I'll definitely consider this, and I think it's so nice to give my loved ones the option to remember me positively. Thank you   
Anyone dying young is a tragedy, so I‚Äôm incredibly sorry for you and your family. Your willingness to do this AMA is admirable.

my heart hurts seeing you like this man. but I got so many questions to ask you so please bear with me. 1.) how does your family feel about your current situation?  2.) do you think you lived your life to the fullest (I know dumb question since you are only 21), but what I mean is did you have a good hs life? did you have a lot of friends? did you have a gf? etc etc 3.) do you believe in an after life? like do you think there is a different universe. like what is your concept of death? are you scared of dying? or are you scared of the feeling of not knowing what death is like? 4.) it hurts to ask me this, but how do you plan on spending the last months of your life?  5.) what are some of the things you are gonna miss the most? people that you are gonna miss the most? and what are you proud of the most? please respond back to me man, I really want to know!  
Hey man, you have some good questions and I'll gladly answer them!  1) Ofcourse it's devastating for them. They know beforehand they'll lose a son. But how weird and maybe even uncomfortable as it sounds, we are enjoying the moments I'm still here. 2) Which brings me here, and yes I had a pretty nice life. Girlfriend, did a lot of activities, sport. I am only 21, granted. But the thing I did, i always did it because i chose for my own happiness. That makes me feel very happy about the time that I had.  3) I'm scared because I really don't know what to expect. I'm not religious myself, but deep inside, I hope I could watch over my loved ones.  4) Doing nice thing with friends and family. That's so important. It's one of the things I learned in the past year and a half. (Time since diagnosis). I talked with many terminal people and "we" all say the same. When death comes, money doesn't matter. People do. 5) my friends and family. Those I'll miss the most ofcourse. I'm most proudest of the people I helped. My case is really bad for my age. And in the hospital, I was in the young adults area most of the time. So I spoke to many young adults who had a hard time getting through chemo. I myself am very experienced in this treatment, so I could ease the pain a bit for them and talk to them. I actually had the nursing team told me that a 17 yo girl mentioned specifically. I had helped her so much. I hope she does well btw.  So I think I covered everything. Ask more if you'd like!  
you have such a kind heart man, im low key getting emotional at 11:47 am. but yes I wanna ask you a couple more. Ps. my dad had cancer when i was 22 (I am 25 now) and he beat it but it really took a toll on his body but he is recovering well and  he is cancer free  and I am so thankful for that. I just hope you find peace within yourself man. you are a young king, don't let anyone tell you any different.  but in one of your comments you said you have a twin sister? wow man how is she dealing with this whole situation? can she also get the same type of cancer you have since you guys are twins?   
Again some good questions. First of all, I wish your dad the best health and that he may flourish and be healthy!  True, we were afraid that it may be a hereditary thing, but after 9 months of research done, they concluded it had nothing to do with DNA and that sort of thing. And like I said. It's hard for her. That's also the thing that hurts me the most

What‚Äôs the one thing that makes you completely laugh your ass off, like tears in your eyes, snort laugh, stomach ache laugh? And contrarily; what‚Äôs the one thing that makes you cry in sadness? Thanks for the AMA.  Sending you comfort.  
Haha like this one. Seeing busy people in public places hurrying and stressing because they are late on schedule, or say, people really giving themselves a hard time over something that I find in the light of my situation, very irrelevant. Makes me laugh thinking, there really is more to life than always being busy. My tip, once in a while, really choose for yourself.  What makes me really sad is the fate of my parents and sister. I'm twins and we really had the plans to grow up. Both have families and be close with each other. That's a future she has to face alone now. That hurts so much. Thanks for your comment. This is why I do this AMA.  
Damn bro im 19 and got a twin brother, if anything happened to him I feel like my entire life  would pretty much fall apart since the dude is basically my best friend. Defiently do what that top comment said about recording yourself. And make sure you throw in some motivational ones too cause if I was your sister I'd definetly need them to get through college or work or life in general. Screw this post man, got me chocking up and stuff. Best wishes to you and your family from me!

How has your view of death changed since your diagnosis? What is the most important thing you feel you will miss out on? I haven't had to face a terminal illness but the thought of that happening does scare me. People don't often believe me when I say it but I honestly don't fear death itself but I do fear how I could die. By reading your answers and responses in this thread it seems you are a very deep thinking individual. I admire that more than anything in a person. Maybe the reason you are leaving early is because you truly are wise beyond your years.  I liked how in one response to a question you stated you feel very sorry for your family having to go on without you. How much it hurts you to know that. I think of death more often than the average person and that bothers me more than most things about it. The fact that if I died my fiance and parents would have to go on. I feel that most people don't think that way. Most are just scared for themselves. I wish I could give you a hug and I wish I could split the years I have left with you. I'm only 30 and I would do it without second thought. I'm sorry if someone already asked this but what are your thoughts for what happens next?  I saw you aren't religious, neither am I. But I do believe all consciousness survives. I never could understand how or why people feel that is any crazier than us being here in the first place. String theory proposes that there is 11 spatial dimensions. Just last year in 2018 scientists were able to carry out an experiment with light and crystals that showed obstructions in the light. These obstructions were coming from the fourth spatial dimension. It was the first time that we have ever been able to actually directly observe anything like this. To think there is so much going on around us at all times and to think we know it all is comical. I feel the materialistic view of reality will be shattered within 50 years. Nothing is even solid. Just billions of atoms swirling around one another creating the illusion of solidity.  Sorry for the rant but I would love to know what you think and I wanted to give you a little to think about yourself. If you ever want to chat with someone I will always be here man. Feel free to PM me whenever.

Hello fellow redditors! I‚Äôm OP‚Äôs twin sister. It‚Äôs devastating to know that my brother and best friend isn‚Äôt gonna be there when I turn 80.  Knowing that he‚Äôs not able to attend life events like getting my nursing degree or getting married etc. is heartbreaking.  But he is still here and we‚Äôre going to make some more memories in the time that we have left!  I‚Äôm going to be around here to help my brother answer your questions!

Hello!  I'm a cancer nurse myself, although not sarcoma. I've scrolled but I didn't see your brother mention when he was diagnosed.  My question is, did your brother's diagnosis inspire you towards nursing?  Also, OP, it's really brave and inspiring that you are willing to share your insight for people. I often find that communication between my patients and their relatives can be strained because they find they don't know what to say. You and other people doing things like this helps break down these barriers ‚ù§Ô∏è

Genuinely curious, what made you want to do this?  
I'm really intrigued about how other people feel towards someone in this situation. I'm a person who is very open towards my death. It helps me in the process as well. Like a therapy maybe ;)  
Are you religious?   
I'm not religious. However some of my close friends are and I'm very open to receive their prayers.

What‚Äôs the feeling like to know your fate?  
Quite damning as you can imagine. But it's actually a battle that I'm fighting. That costs energy. When the doctors told me they only would treat to soften pain. It gave a feeling of relief, weirdly enough.   
How long did the drs give you to live?   
Nowadays they won't actually tell you, because most of the time it's completely off. But I'm guessing it's months

Do people treat you differently since you've "accepted" your death? If so, how does it make you feel?  
You can tell who are  the "real" and "fake" friends. And talking about it is hard and uncomfortable. But when you do, it all becomes easier.  
It's a hard thing, facing death when you're  young with limited life experience.   One of my friends from high school developed a terminal glioblastoma.  As he progressed, he lost the ability to speak and it was really hard for me at the time to see him like that.  I withdrew from him and wasn't really around him when he passed.   At the time, I didn't have the awareness to even see what I was doing let alone why I was doing it.   Now, as an older adult looking back, my actions and motivations were clear.   it is one of the things I regret the most about my youth.

Hi!  Thanks for doing the AMA... I'm so very sorry to hear about your situation. I lost my dad half a year ago, so I've been thinking a lot about death and what I would have done differently if I knew in advance that he would die. I very much agree with OlFlirtyBastard's idea of making recordings for your close ones.  Reading your responses here, you seem like such a peaceful, delightful person.  Do you think your ways of interacting with people have changed ever since you found out about your illness? There are some people who say "once you get old, there's no point in holding back... so I just say what I mean!" We have all these social dynamics that dictate how we are supposed to relate to others, codes of politeness and distance when it comes to meeting new people, all that. What about dealing with conflict situations? Has it become easier or harder to solve problems with people you love? Sorry if this is an insensitive question! No need to answer, in this case. :)  I am writing my PhD thesis about artists' perception of time, so I am of course wondering if your perception of time changed at all, or the way you relate to your everyday experiences... The way we slip through everyday life is mostly (supposed to be?) kind of transparent, taken for granted. Some philosophers say that art can change your sense of time this way, make you stop and appreciate. I would think it might be something like that with a terminal illness, too. What do you think?  Sending you heaps of support and lots of love. I hope your life will be wonderful, I hope you will do everything you want to do. Big hugs!  ‚Äã ‚Äã

Something about this AMA strikes a chord somewhere deep inside me, it's difficult to explain. Perhaps it's because we're similarly young (I'm 19) and the idea of someone dying so young is horrifying. My question to you is, has your opinion on life changed since your diagnosis? I don't mean this in a "I have a bucket list and now I have a reason to finish them off as soon as I can" way. Did it ever make you sit down and just introspect on your life and your circumstances at that very moment?  Everyone looks back on their lives and wonders how it would pan out if they shuffled things up a little. Is there something you put off for later that you realise now should be done ASAP? Sorry for the mess of a question, I have a bunch more but that's it for now I guess.

I‚Äôm sorry to hear about your prognosis. I would hope that I could handle it as well as you seem to be, but I know that I wouldn‚Äôt. I know this because I‚Äôm being treated for stage 4 osteosarcoma (bone cancer). I had it in 2011, then in 2017, it had spread to my left lung, some lymph nodes in my chest, and my right adrenal gland.  Were it not for immunotherapy (it obliterated an inoperable tumor the size of a softball), I likely wouldn‚Äôt be here. What is it about your cancer that caused doctors to determine it‚Äôs untreatable? Mine was close to being the same, so it just a nerve close to home. In any case, I‚Äôm really glad you have access to weed and that the docs are keeping your pain in check.

I‚Äôm petrified of not knowing what comes after death (highly not religious), like I get panic attacks from over thinking it. Have you been in a similar situation during all of this, if so how did you overcome it and what do you think happens. Btw thank you for doing this. You have certainly made a difference

Genuinely curious. Let's say if, by some miracle, you beat cancer. How differently would you love your life?  My best to you. May you enjoy every moment of your life, however long that may be and hopefully that miracle happens. ‚ù§Ô∏è

What are some of your favorite Stephen king books? For me it's probably Pet Semetary, The Shining and Lisey's Story :) Also I'd love to send you a card with a doodle and a quote from one of Stephen King's books. Just lmk if you'd be open to that and I'll pm you!

Have you agreed on a sign you could attempt to send your sister or parents if there is something on the other side? Like sending a bird to tap on the window or something?  
Yeah we actually do, we‚Äôve got cats and they like to be tapped on their backs. They‚Äôll react to it by raising their butts in the air. So if they do that when nobody is touching them, it‚Äôs my brother :)

I‚Äôm a successful writer who‚Äôs about to lose my ability to write‚ÄîI‚Äôve got a brain tumor sitting on the language processing center of my left frontal lobe. Before the tumor first erodes my skills then kills me, I‚Äôm writing one million words‚Äî12 books in 12 months. AMA.
Damn dude.. that's rough.  Have you enjoyed your life as a ghostwriter? Do you wish you could have had some more of the limelight?  What is one of your favorite sentences you've ever read? No context necessary. Edit: a couple more questions  Is the diagnosis 100% going to kill you? Is there any chance of recovery? If so do you a set time limit or is it up in the air about when you'll pass?  
Thanks so much for asking. Let's see. I absolutely love my life as a ghost. What other opportunity does a person have to "play" a brain surgeon, an NFL quarterback, a tech guru, for a year at a time? I love the majority of my author-clients, some of whom have become close friends ... My favorite sentence ever in a classic book is "Language is a cracked kettle on which we beat out tunes for dancing bears, when we would move the stars to pity." --Gustave Flaubert, Madame Bovary, 1856 Yes, it's 100 percent going to kill me, insofar as the skull is a finite space, and the tumor will eventually start growing (we're dealing with the 20 percent of it left after surgery). HAVING SAID THAT, brain cancer science literally evolves on the daily, so there's a good chance that new and different treatment will come into use as things progress ... So I'm hopeful. Not negative--just realistic. Thanks so much for asking cool questions.  You can follow the whole adventure at amillionwordsaway.com All Best, B  
I will be keeping up with your story. Good luck.

You should know this: Several years ago the Federal government admitted that medical marijuana shrunk serious brain tumors. It was one of the first times the government admitted cannabis can help against cancer. I remember it specifically being about shrinking brain tumors.  I have personally known a skin cancer patient who successfully treated their skin cancer with topical cannabis ointments.  
Yeah, I've been reading a lot about the benefits of CBD in particular. I've heard it can help with cancer, esp. brain tumors. It's also good, supposedly, for headaches, which I suffer. And sleep, which can be an issue with chronic pain situations. I've experimented, but just a wee bit. Thanks so much for the note.

Are you sure it‚Äôs a death sentence? If yes, does knowing either way it goes you‚Äôll die make accepting your death easier? Sorry if they come off as grim  
Thanks for asking. I'm not being negative ... only realistic. They were able to get only a certain percentage of the tumor out in surgery ... The rest is too integrated in my frontal lobe ... "Like oatmeal on a rug," they say.  So ... realistically, it will start growing, and it will eat up my language skills ... eventually it will kill me. But ... There's every day new stuff going on in cancer research. The brain, in particular, tends to get a lot of attention and money for studies. So ... anything can happen. I remain hopeful and optimistic on a daily basis. But I try to live every day like it's a good day to die. (PS Not at all grim). Thanks for asking!

Dang man that sucks, I hope you are beyond satisfied with the work that you accomplished and I wish you the best in your life <3  
I don't so much see it as a bummer, but an opportunity. I've been a successful ghostwriter for a long time, helping others' get their voices heard. It's finally a chance -- life or death / write or die -- to get my own stuff out there. I'm grateful. Not that I would wish a brain tumor on anyone else. For me, though, it's been a positive wake up call. Thanks so much for asking!  
Can I get a name for the books? And what genre? I'd love to check them out.

How's sleep coming?  
Wow. That's a great question. The tumor itself doesn't affect sleep, but the chronic pain -- crippling headaches -- does. I took sleeping pills for the first few years, but for the past year, I'm taking only melatonin and valerian now. Thanks for asking!  
NP. I figured in the same situation I'd be anxious as hell.  
Yeah, I get it. I don't have anxiety meaning worry. I have anxiety meaning urgency. And I wish I hadn't waited for a brain tumor to start feeling urgency. You know? ASSUME THE TUMOR, MAN! Anvils can fall out of the sky at any moment. So ... do what you must. Do what you need to do. Tell her you love her. Get out of the situation. Whatever. Thanks for commenting!

Did the discovery of the tumor lead you to change the priority of your subjects?  
Yes, definitely. Going for more meaning, you know. Must leave a legacy before it's too late! All 12 books are in different formats and different genres. Just finishing the second one now. Thanks so much for asking!  
You're welcome! Would you like to share your subject matter here? Are you writing, fiction, memoir, graphic novels, philosophy?  
All of the above. Each of the 12 in a different genre, different format, from interactive ebook to graphic novel. War stories. Love stories. Family saga. Sci-Fi. The whole gamut! It's all fiction, though. I've made my bones as a ghost for nonfiction, with a lot of books to my credit. This is my own stuff, finally, my stories, my characters. The real me, what's inside my head (pardon the pun) finally out there for the masses ... Thanks so much for asking.

Is this for real? :(  
Yes, of course. I'm OK for now (after several surgeries) but I WILL lose the ability to write -- even to speak -- at any time. I hope it'll be a while ... Thanks so much for asking.  
I hope it takes much much longer for that to happen... Can I ever read smth from you?  
Thanks so much. I hope so, too. Been a while now with no movement, so that's a good sign that it's going to be more than a year -- I hope lots more -- but it COULD happen any day. Yes, absolutely.

How will you speak?  
Yeah. Scary question, right? Thanks for asking. The tumor -- nicknamed "Ollie" -- is on language expression, which is in a different part of the brain than language comprehension. Which means I should be able to still understand speech. Just not USE it. For now, I'm practicing all kinds of workarounds for my aphasia (word finding challenges). The brain's a miraculous and complex place, and I can feel the "neuroplasticity" in action on a daily basis. We're wondering whether I'll be able to use sign language or singing after speech goes kaput ...

You know what guys? All this kerfuffle is pretty dumb. Saydrah's been a productive member of this community for longer than most. That she happens to work in social networking shouldn't count against her, unless you can give me legitimate proof that she's somehow gamed the system. And as far as her being a "power user", well yeah, she kind of is. She submits more links than the average user, and comments more, so she's got name recognition. She moderates a couple of popular subreddits, but then, so does Karmanaut, heartfence, and qgyh2...but I hear nothing about their misdeeds. All of this is getting stirred up because MMM got pissy after getting let go as a mod from IAMA, and because internets are really super serious business, he considered it a level and coolheaded idea to threaten the privacy and anonymity of IAMA submitters. Read that again, and then tell me why anyone is jumping to his defense? The guy lost the moral high ground the very instant he decided he would make that threat.   
I agree. Working in social media doesn't make you inherently evil.

 BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWW  FTFY.  
Your comment would make a lot more sense if I was someone banned/kicked/whatever by Saydrah - which I'm not.  At least not yet. So let me ask you this, do you not care at all about any of the points shown here? link.  If not, why not (I'm asking in earnest)?  
I honestly couldn't care less if Saydrah set small Rwandan children on fire for a living.  Newsflash! Moderator selection isn't democratic. Karma whores invariably post things people want to read- whether they're being paid or not.  No objection whatsoever /shrugs This isn't Digg- each user's votes have the same weighting, and the "Friends" system is far more cumbersome. The culture's very much against the idea of "HEY EVERYONE I JUST POSTED X VOTE IT UP". She can't do any harm.

I can kind of see where you're coming from, but she's done nothing against the rules. The material she submits doesn't even hint that she would have an advantage over other users like a press pass, or inside source. The more you submit the more your name gets seen, and people get comfortable and trust upvoting your submissions. It may take awhile at the start but just submit more articles. She submits between 10-20 submissions on average.  
Don't get me wrong - I don't care if you're submitting links to promote your site.  As far as I'm concerned, that's just reddit working as intended.  What I'm against is moderators who have a vested interest in social media.  A moderator is supposed to be a fair arbitrator of the rules.  Obviously, being the enforcer, they're not subject to the same rules (they can do speed posting, for instance).  That's fine.  But you cross that line when you start using your modding ability to do self-promotion, silence dissenters, etc.  It seems like that's what Saydrah is doing.  
I'm not sure why you think that. As a mod, you cannot:  Self-Promote Speed post Silent dissenters (i.e. cancel out down-votes)  You can ban users, but it won't do any good because it is discussed among all the mods before a ban is placed, and the ban lists are not long at all. Edit: Not sure why I'm being downvoted for sharing information about how the system works.  
 Silent dissenters (i.e. cancel out down-votes)   you can ban users, in fact you can ban them in such a way they don't even know they're banned - their submissions and comments just do't show up.

You can ban comments without the poster even knowing. That kind of fucked up shit is just that, fucked up shit.

Being a mod of a particular subreddit does allow you to speed post. You are not subject to tripping the spam filter, nor do you have a time limit when submitting more then 2 articles.

 I can kind of see where you're coming from, but she's done nothing against the rules.  Indeed, she's exceedingly good at staying within the rules. But the thing is, I see her name come up an awful lot when reddit drama happens--especially when it comes to moderator-type drama.  Why is that?

I haven't seen the threads, and though I think your banning does sound unreasonable, you should probably have expected questions of this nature to be received differently by some "gay kid" versus a self-described "closet slut".

No, I just saw that there'd been no postings, and the last time I made this sort of thing in IAmA, it was simply downvoted.

I hope you're able to go outside and spend a little time in nature. Is the area very different from where your home is?  
Hey Met, it is very different from my hometown. It's very lovely here. I get out and hike/bike ride each day. The thought of loneliness brings me back to my hotel where I just scroll on my phone. How are you?  
I'm doing ok. I've been wfh for a few years and I am not happy about it. I was planning on moving to a new job this spring but that's not happening. In a place where I'd have a lot of time I'd be looking for a hobby - have you considered bird watching while you're out? What I'm feeling now is everything being the same day to day and productivity is falling. I'm thinking of starting some online courses once I meet some work objectives. What are you doing to keep up?

How is it & how did you get insomnia?  
Id like you to clear up that first question since to me its a little fuzzy. But for the second question, i have a narcissistic mother. She causes me a lot of stress and anxiety, especially with everything that's going on right now. Stress, anxiety, and depression are leading causes for Insomnia. So i got Insomnia due to stress and anxiety from my mother.  
I meant, how do you get by the night?  
Oh! I usually just go on my phone. But because i am a teen, i cant do that all the time. Ill just stare at the ceiling or wall. I know it sounds bland, but thats because im a teen. But yeah, stare at something or my phone.

I have high functioning autism AND ADHD ask me anything!
Whats ur mbti type?  
I'm not entirely sure what you're referring to. Can you elaborate on the question?  
Sure I wanted to know whats ur mbti type bc i was curious. Mbti is a personality system and there are some online tests to figure your type out but the 16 personalities test is bad and the most inaccurate. Mbti is based on cognitive functions who are scientifically proven. So it makes a lot of sense. Most tests are based on cognitive functions for example idrlabs and 2key. My type for example is an infp. An mbti type is based on 4 letters and there are 8 to describe them. Those 8 are E/i S/N F/T P/J. I could go on with this but it takes a lot of time. If you want to just take the test or do your own research.  
I didn't know about it, i will definitely do it and get back to you with the results.

Have you considered taking them with you?  
I did, very often, but they told me to not do it. It's difficult to explain, but we don't want to leave at this point of time. Leaving family behind is so difficult, I can't imagine how I'll manage it when I'm grown. After all, they're blood.

Are you the only one abused and what would have to happen for you to finally call child protective services?  
I'm 16 years old and live in an abusive household. AMA
Go to the cops and tell them you don‚Äôt wanna go back. Just get out.  
I can't. I really can't. I made a promise to my siblings. They begged me to not do anything. I can't just leave like that; Everything I know would just end up in a huge mess, and I'll be forced into something worse than I ever went through. Really, everything is pushing me to go, but everything is holding me back.

Hey. You're better then all of this. You just need to be strong for a little while longer, and then you can get the hell out of Dodge. This isn't a question, it's just support, or at least it's trying to be. I grew up with an abusive father who beat me and my mom, and is a convicted child rapist. If I can move on, you can too. It will get better. Maybe not today, maybe not in years, but it will get better.  
Thank you for the kind words, I will try my best to keep it up! And you're very brave for being able to move on.  Good luck in the future!

It's terrible what you and your siblings are going through. At what point do you think you can become independent and leave your household?  
I'm generally just trying to save as much money as I can, so I believe once I'm around 18-20 I will be able to leave the household and live on my own and go to university. It's my dream to become a Prosecutor!

Have you ever tried threatening your father with police or CPS when he physically abuses you? Also have you ever sat down with him and explained to him that what he‚Äôs doing is wrong and is tearing up the family and hurting you?  
Being sued for failed suicide
Do you have any evidence on what really went down? Or did you throw it all away? And how is this affecting your life currently?  
I'm having to go to court and prove I'm not malicious, most of the paperwork is from my lawyers office. He tells me they are just trying to beat statues of limitations and I've nothing to worry about. But I have things to lose and a past I don't want brought into the light so all in all it's one big stress ball.  
I just got my first laser tattoo removal treatment. AMA.
What was the tattoo?  
One is of three cocopellis on my ankle all in black. It's pretty cute but totally not my style anymore. The other was a sort of tribally ring on my upper arm that I let my friend do for me when she was practicing to get a license. That seemed like a nice idea 20 years ago.  
My sister married a tattoo artist.  As a practice canvas, she has a few that I am pretty sure she is going to need removed in 20 years.  :)    
Start putting money into a removal fund as an anniversary gift!

Also, which hurt worse?  The removal or the tattoo?   
I just got my first laser tattoo removal treatment. AMA.
I had my first treatment two days ago. I've been thinking about having my 20-year-old, faded tattoo removed for a long time and finally jumped on it when TeamBuy offered a really good deal for the place I'd already decided to go.  It's really interesting...I wonder how long it will take for the "scavenger cells" to eat up and carry away the broken-down pigment. Right now I have a raised, welty-looking tattoo with kind of a rash all around it (like your picture).  FWIW I felt that getting it removed was far worse than getting it put on.   
I wonder how long this phase lasts too. It's itchy as all fucking hell after two weeks. The required eight weeks between treatments makes much more sense to me now. Good luck!

Do you have before and after pics?  
I don't have a good before, but here's what it looks like two weeks after my first treatment. Before the treatment the figures were perfectly black with clean edges. Now they're kind of blurry and faded. Black ink is supposed to be most responsive to laser treatment, but it seems like I'll need several more treatments to really make a difference. They're still healing - I think my winter dry skin is not helping and I'm putting lotion on that spot several times a day. I'll take before and after pics for my next treatment in mid-March.  
Also, the laser doesn't just hit once and that's the effect you get.  It will increase over time from that one session, as well.  
Do you mean the blurry/faded effect? Or the dry/scabby effect?  
I just got my first laser tattoo removal treatment. AMA.
How did you decide where to go? Just a dermatologist's office?  
I got a couple of recommendations from my doctor but they didn't have the latest equipment and wanted to do surgical removal which just seemed weird to me.  I did a lot of research and found that the Q-switch laser is cutting edge for tattoo removal (not that I know what Q-switch means).  Find a place that OWNS a Q-switch laser. Some places rent them temporarily, so they're not always available for treatments and the employees may not have as much experience with them.

I suffer from Genophobia to be clear it is the fear of sexual intercourse
I'm catholic so I always heard the "Sex before marriage is forbidden" talk. I don't have a fear of Sex but a fear of how it will change me once its done. I was never told that I would go to hell for it but that it was HIGHLY looked down upon and that "everyone would know" because they would see that it "physically" changed something about me. I'm still a virgin because of it so I more or less understand what you might be feeling. If I could, I would do it in a heartbeat if the feeling of guilt didn't linger. My family strongly implemented this ideology but as I got closer to my 20's my parents stopped trying to scare me out of it and became completely honest with me. My aunts and uncles still try to put this idea in my cousins and in me sometimes even though I'm an adult now.  
I grew up in the Purity culture where you at the takes take class but absence only classes there I scared the s*** out of you they show you what happens to you if you do it outside of their especially the Christian hell houses during the special Halloween class they'll take you in and they'll take you to the abortion part of the Hell House you are now given a test many paths you get these shiny purity ring. Right now I am the only one in my family who is a virgin  
Whoa. Yeah my church just shames you for it. There's no special hell for losing your virginity

I am women diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder and Narcissistic Personality Disorder, ask me anything.
I‚Äôm not even sure what my answer to this question would be exactly, but what motivates you to treat other people well?  
Honestly, things are easier if I do so. If I treat people the way I want to it would be straight-up social suicide lol, sometimes is really hard but I do therapy to try to fix this.  
Ah, I see. Do you care about other people‚Äôs well-being at all or about certain people‚Äôs or not about anyone‚Äôs?  
I wouldn't say that I don't care about anyone, my type of caring is different. When it comes to my family I can say that they are important to me, I like them. But is very hard for me to connect with people that I don't know, therefore, I don't care about them, is not intentional I just can't feel anything.

Maybe that inappropriate to ask (u dont need to answer) what are your diagnoses and how old are you? How long have you ben depressed?  
no i‚Äôm an open book!  i‚Äôve been diagnosed with bipolar II disorder  i‚Äôm now 19  i‚Äôm not depressed. bc i‚Äôm not sad all the time actually i‚Äôm quite a happy person. being bipolar is like a switch. when it gets triggered i‚Äôm like 180. boom. different person. those 180 turns in my personality can be happy or sad. (most the time they end up me being sad when i‚Äôm having an episode)  and this has been going on since i was 10  
Did u know from where you got the bipolar?

when i was a kid i wanted to go back because it was a break from the things i had going on. but as an adult no . because then i can‚Äôt pay my bills.

Ive always loved dogs on general. I can across another zoos fantasy blog and read a few posts and things just clicked. I started looking into it more and more. I was probably around 17 at the time  
Was it hard to accept yourself?  
Yes. Most people don't understand it and are against it. It's hard for me to be open about it in my real life. I've lost friends and relationships before. The person I'm dating right now is accepting of it. It makes things easier.  
I, 20F, am a Zoophile. Ask me things!
Sorry to break it to you, but you¬¥re not a zoophile. You are not active with an animal and you don¬¥t seem to have any intent to change that; also your whole "zoophilia" solely consists of "watching animal movies/pictures"...that alone doesn¬¥t turn you into a zoo. I really wonder what you are able to offer here, in an AMA about something you don¬¥t take part in, you hardly know more than "watching animal movies/pix" while masturbating, yet you propagate yourselves as "we"...as if you, a non experienced person obviously living a rather normal life, had anything significant to bring into the debate. You know what¬¥s worse than no information? False information. From people who self "identify" as X or Y, but have no actual connection to what they claim to be. Sorry for the harsh words, but I don¬¥t see you being able to give out any relevant info at all.  
I haven't had sex with an animal, but I know for a fact I'm attracted to them. I don't need to have sex with humans to know I'm attracted to them. Zoo porn is highly illegal and risky so I try not to get involved with that too much. Internet activity is easier to track than what happens in my personal home. Although your response was well thought out and critical, I think you're basing attraction solely off of sexual experiences and that's not how attraction works.

I think I'm addicted to free time. To the point where I don't want to have kids. And I want a low maintenance relationship.   
Same though. I took a job working 12 hour days just so I can have an extra day off every week. Not so I can go do anything or hang out with friends. I just want to play video games and chill with my bf and dog.  
How do you handle 12 x4 week ? I work a normal 8 hour shift and I'm wreaked by the end

I wonder if your spouse refers to you as a big woman child . Hmmm   
I doubt it, considering she's the adult in the relationship.  
You don't really know that EDIT: I'm sorry, this was a really stupid and pointless comment. But I don't want to delete it because you'll see a message notification and not be able to see what it was. Have a good one.  
I doubt it, considering she's the adult in the relationship.  
And you know this relationship personally ? My original point is if the genders were reversed and someone was randomly calling their spouse a child it would be jumped on instantly . Especially in a comment that has no need to mention it.  But because ‚Äúman child‚Äù is an accepted term it seems to go unnoticed .  A bit of equality would be nice .

Yes I will actually go to sleep earlier before days off because I know I will have some free time then.

Oh yeah. Isn‚Äôt it sad that people stay up all night, go to work running on empty, and then do it all over again every single day just to feel like they have any time at all to themselves? This is what scares me about having kids. I have very little free time as it is and I already feel run down just from working full time and keeping the house up. Add a kid to the mix and these eye bags are a permanent feature.

Is there anyone who has a LPT or advice on how to change this? I'm running on fumes permanently because of this and shit needs to change. A valuable tip or advice please. Not "just go to bed earlier".  
I don't know how viable this is for you stranger, but can you cut back on your work? I went part-time a couple of years ago and having my life not revolve around work has done wonders for my mental health. Totally been worth not having much money for.

YES MY WIFE HATES IT!! I get at least 5 hours of sleep on days I work.  I get up at 830 and go to bed at 3 or 330.  I just can't bring myself to go to bed at an earlier time even though I'm just playing video games or watching youtube/browsing reddit.  But usually when my wife is awake I'm hanging out with her, so when she goes to bed at 1130 that is my free time, which I want more than an hour or two of.  
This is us.  If you can manage it, I recommend separate bedrooms.  Wife and I have been sleeping apart most nights for pushing twenty years now.

DAE think the music they listen to is really good while listening alone, but when showing it to others, they get extremely self-conscious about it?
Yeah and then when they say they don‚Äôt like it you sort of start to have a different feeling about the song.   
Or a different feeling about the person.   
Or a different feeling about your own life.   
Or a different feeling about the person.   
Lol I'm such a douche, I'm like "they just don't get how amazing this song is." Like I know music is subjective but there are some songs i genuinely don't understand how people don't like.   
Or a different feeling about the person.   
Yeah and then when they say they don‚Äôt like it you sort of start to have a different feeling about the song.   
Or you feel nothing different because you dont give a fuck about their opinion  
This is me half of the time and the other half is being extremely insecure.  
So on avg. you give half fuck  
Yeah and then when they say they don‚Äôt like it you sort of start to have a different feeling about the song.   
I  accept it but when they scorn at you for liking that type of music..I abandon them. No one needs friends who disses you for liking a type of music.  
Half my buddies have listened to primarily rap since we were young and the other half primarily metal. All really good friends but we just like busting the other's balls about what they're listening to

It's a really weird experience. It's not like showing someone a joke, or a meme. It's not like sharing a news article or a Reddit thread. Those are all media that help us relate and connect with things around us. My music is me, for lack of a better description. The music I listen to is so intensely personal that it's almost an externalization of my own emotions. Sharing my music feels like sharing a piece of myself. Never do I feel more vulnerable than when I share my music. Because them not liking it feels like them not liking me.

Yeah I like enjoying music by myself... some songs are just too deep that they make me uncomfortable sharing with other people  
I feel like with a good chunk of my songs, you have to listen to them multiple times to get the meaning, so it sounds like nonsense with one listen  
Your songs? Care to share your discography? This should be an AMA. We have a person with their own songs!  
I appreciate the mocking nature of the comment based on taking a figurative element as literal, funny

If you actually want to show it to others, give them a Spotify playlist/whatever and let them listen to it on their own time. They're unlikely to be able to absorb it while you're watching and (personally) I don't really come to like songs until I've heard them a few times, which is more likely to happen if I have them on Spotify. Also avoids your problem.  
Getting a friend to actually listen to my spotify playlist is a task in itself

I was actually thinking about this recently myself! I am extremely self-conscious and quite low on the confidence scale, so whenever I share something, it‚Äôs always quite precious to me (despite how cheesy that may sound). A little recently, I have been really into Synthwave and 80s-style music because I love the sounds and nostalgia (even when not having lived in it) feelings I get from them. It just makes me feel great! When I shared it to a friend, he was like, ‚ÄúIs this what you really listen to?‚Äù I instantly deflected it and avoided the subject entirely. I don‚Äôt want to paint him badly as he may have been curious, but I was quite hurt by that unfortunately. I also am the type of person who usually does not reveal his hobbies or interests (e.g., music, etc.) until I know a person well enough. Always anxious about what people think! I am quite flexible in my music preferences as well, as I tend to really like certain stuff from all genres. Especially ‚Äúepic‚Äù music, classical, EDM, and pop. It really depends on mood at the moment. Heck, I even love to listen to anime openings and soundtracks too from them; as well as video games and movies because some are genuinely great!   
I used to be very similar to you. I think that‚Äôs just the overly sensitive side of us showing. You have to remember that people will never not like you just for your taste in music and nothing is wrong with you for having a different taste in music. Granted I‚Äôm not gonna show certain songs to people just because they might be so foreign to them they won‚Äôt enjoy it, but just because someone dislikes your taste in music doesn‚Äôt mean anything bad about you.

I know I have terrible taste in music (Nickelback, Five Finger Death Punch, etc.) so yes. I definitely enjoy listening to my kind of music alone, but if someone passes me the aux, I freak tf out  
My very first rock concert was nickelback. I was ten years old and I don‚Äôt like telling people.   
My first concert was Van Halen - the original band. I went at age 14, and it was awesome. My second concert was Quiet Riot. Never heard of them? Yeah, some of us are still trying to forget. Lol

You just have to be proud of who you are and what you enjoy. Nobody can mock confidence.  
DAE think the music they listen to is really good while listening alone, but when showing it to others, they get extremely self-conscious about it?
Most of the music I enjoy is because of the beat/melody/flow, so I don't pay too much attention to the lyrics. When playing the music for someone else is when I first seem to notice how repetitive or dirty the lyrics are. Although I do enjoy dirty lyrics, but mostly because I see them the same as saying a dirty joke, where I can't take them seriously.

Not one person I know IRL listens to more than 2 or 3 artists in my library. Even then, they only know like radio singles. I thought people these days were all about the indie shit? Just me?  
No, everyone loves trap and pop rap now. I listen to backpacker rap (conscious rap) and they just are not interested  
DAE think the music they listen to is really good while listening alone, but when showing it to others, they get extremely self-conscious about it?
Absolutely. I think it‚Äôs because music is a huge part of my life, and I feel like showing people my favorite bands or songs is akin to revealing something very deep and personal to someone. It‚Äôs me being vulnerable

A lot of people are just not open-minded to music. If they have not heard I on the radio before, they think it sucks.  
Hey, MotoMola, just a quick heads-up: alot is actually spelled a lot. You can remember it by it is one lot, 'a lot'. Have a nice day! The parent commenter can reply with 'delete' to delete this comment.

Yeah. I turned on Disturbed‚Äôs ‚ÄúDown With the Sickness.‚Äù I was super pumped to share it with my friend and had the biggest smile on my face waiting for the ‚Äúoh wa ahahahahah.‚Äù She turned to me and said ‚ÄúWTF is this? This sounds like some sort of goat slaughtering music.‚Äù I learned that day that David Draiman isn‚Äôt for everyone.   
kinda feel like anyone who still hasn‚Äôt heard Down With the Sickness probably isn‚Äôt going to like it lol

Yes and I would absolutely love to hear any tips of avoiding this!! Except for pretending the ‚Äúthing to do‚Äù isn‚Äôt actually happening - ugh !   
Yes...or if ‚Äúthing to do‚Äù isn‚Äôt even that stressful or a big deal at all. Like, I‚Äôll be all uptight if I have to call my mom later. Tips, please.  
Give yourself an hour buffer for whatever and try to live your life as your otherwise would. You can get cleaned up and 15min to wherever (physically or mentally) within that time window regardless of plans and their potential to change. It helps me, most of my friends work in the service industry so things always happen later than my schedule.  
and then you dread waiting for that hour buffer slowly approaching.

Set an alarm and forget about it until the alarm goes off is what I do  
Thanks, I might try that! Like set it for 30 mins before the task and then you only have that time to think/worry about it.   
Depends what it is but essentially yeah. Like if I'm going out later in the day I'll set the alarm for when I need to start getting ready.  
Thanks, I might try that! Like set it for 30 mins before the task and then you only have that time to think/worry about it.   
I‚Äôm 31 and have had this problem my whole life. Recently I stumbled upon the alarm technique on my own and it turns out that it works great, at least for me. Perfect example was Christmas Eve and stressing about family dinner at 5. Usually I would have frittered the whole day away but I set an alarm for 3:30 so I had plenty of time to get ready then enjoyed the day. For me, I think the stress comes worrying I‚Äôll get too involved with something and forget to get ready on time, or even go.

I know it‚Äôs been like 5 months since you posted this, but I wanted to respond with what‚Äôs helped me the most! I have a job that requires me to start work around 4-6pm depending on the day. So if I wake up at around 7:30, it gives me about 8-10 hours of free time. 8-10 hours is usually longer than whatever shift I‚Äôm working, and even if I saved all of my errands to do on one day, I could probably still get them done in those 8-10 hour days.  Obviously not everyone is the same as me, but once I‚Äôm done with all those errands, and side task and whatever else, and I still have a few hours before work, that‚Äôs when I just kind of mentally shut off for a bit and watch some tv or play some video games. I can only do that for so long before I get bored, but by that time it‚Äôs time to go to work, and then it feels like a whole new day! Instead of napping, I just ‚Äúshut off‚Äù for a while and it makes me feel like my weeks have like 10-15 days just because of how I break it up. I know this is a huge ramble and stream of consciousness but it‚Äôs really helped me not feel overwhelmed and like I have too much to do in one day. TL,DR: If you work late or have something to do late, make sure you get everything you need done well before that time comes, and take the time in between to mentally shut down for a while.

It almost feels like a countdown, and I can't enjoy my time without, worrying about it. Even if it's nothing to even worry about.  
Because IT IS I feel like there's a timer just counting down the time until I have to do the thing Every time I look at the clock, I calculate how much time I have left. I am the timer.   
It almost feels like a countdown, and I can't enjoy my time without, worrying about it. Even if it's nothing to even worry about.  
Yep.  Most days I work from 11 to 7 at night (out the door at 10, home by 7.30/8 ish) and people are like ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you just do x, y, z before work‚Äù and it‚Äôs really hard to get myself to do it.  I‚Äôm up at 9, which is fine because I can sleep late, but I just can‚Äôt imagine getting up at 6 and use those 3 hours for anything productive   
I have the SAME schedule! Feel the same way.

Maybe find out what time in the night you need to shift gears and start getting ready. Set an alarm for that time and just forget about it and live in the moment   
Tried that, it seemed like it should work, but I never trust the alarm so then I keep checking the alarm over and over again.

Seriously. Around 11pm Friday, I start stressing over 9am Monday.   
lol - i start stressing about Monday 3pm on Sunday

Always. I can't relax if I have any commitments in the day at all.

I have a lot of anxiety related to being on time. This mostly just means that I'm early for most things, but when I have obligations later in the day I get really nervous about doing anything else for fear that it will complicated the timeline and make me late. What has helped is scheduling stuff beforehand. If I need to take my mom to the airport at 5pm, I'll pencil in an hour to do cleaning or shopping, make a plan for lunch, etc. If I have a solid idea of what I want to get done -- and if I block out time for it -- I can better gauge how I'm doing on time and then I won't feel like I'm going to be late for an evening commitment just because I want to spend 30 minutes watching a TV show at 8:30 am.

Yes! I always get this with doctors and dentist appointments too. It happens with any appointment really. It sucks.

I work 12:30-3:30 pm Monday through Friday. Sometimes I‚Äôll stay in bed until 11 to get ready, then I feel guilty for not getting up earlier to get stuff done.   
I regularly do this, to my shame. To avoid that uncomfortable feeling of waiting around with the clock ticking I'd rather go back to sleep for another hour or so and pretend it isn't happening.   
This is too real.

Not sure but I've always assumed this was an ADHD thing, since for me it's all about being afraid I'll get distracted, forget about the time, and then either be late or miss the thing altogether.  Because of course that really has happened, more times than I like to think about.  Glad to know I'm not the only one.  Well, not really -- sorry others have this too.

Literally assumed I was the only one, didn't realize how much this very thing bothered me until I just read this dae... thanks so much for your post! Even if I have a nail appt, or some silly doctors visit that will take 15min, it's on my mind all day until I go:( I do this with EVERYTHING, actually except, strangely, for work (kind of). I work nights 7p to 7a...I wake up at 4p and do the typical pre- getting ready stuff (eat, coffee, read, etc...)but don't allow myself to think about work or contemplate what sort of shift we're likely to have until 530p... that's when I shower and get actually ready for work.  Really a frustrating habit, being obsessed with whatever is coming next rather than living in the moment,smh. EDITED for "Eric", (lol it was etc...), and a few other typos!

Yeah except make it month instead of a week. Essay deadline in 3 weeks? Yeah let's worry about that every waking second so that I can't enjoy anything and the angst makes me completely unproductive to the point that despite being worried a long time in advance I'm rushing everything at the last second and performing poorly.

This is the main reason I gave up being a musician. Rehearsals/Performances are usually at night. When teaching the earliest people wanted lessons were about 11am. I would have anxiety to the point I would cancel the lesson, as I just couldn't do it as it ruined my WHOLE day. I now work 6am - 2pm in a "normal" job and my depression is 90% better. No hanging around, I wake up @ 4.45am, get ready and leave. The work and people are awful, so anxiety and rage is bad, but depression is a-ok.

DAE put "reddit" at the end of their search on Google when looking for an answer because they trust reddit more?
It's not that I trust Reddit more, it's that I want to see discussion on what I'm googling, not just an article by 1 dude  
Definitely this. Also lots of articles/blog posts tend to give corny or unrealistic advice and are generally annoying to read.

Definitely this. Also lots of articles/blog posts tend to give corny or unrealistic advice and are generally annoying to read.  
Which I could maybe deal with if there were comments..... nothing is worse than seeing ‚Äú0 comments‚Äù

Also something (probably) more current. Not some BS from 2008.   
Or it won't even have a date and you gotta do some detective work to figure it out.

Also not drowning in useless articles from useless websites who just want to earn a quick buck by making sensational articles. Some topics are IMPOSSIBLE to google because of this, several pages of Google Searches will be nothing but weird blog-ish websites publishing editorials or useless articles that wants you to scroll through 5 pages of intrusive ads to give you an answer that could have been given in one sentence. New videogames are especially bad with this, with every site trying to publish their own little article. Searching anything related with GAME will give you hundreds of game websites with their own little mini "guides" or useless walkthroughs slathered in ad-content. I could be searching for ways to solve a specific bug and all I will get is MOUNTAINS OF TRASH ARTICLES.  I swear, Google is becoming more and more useless every year because people know how to game the system. The only way to avoid it is to search for specific websites.

Not because I trust reddit more, but because the answers are more realistic and diverse.

Some answers require more of a professional knowledge though, so reddit is not exactly the best trustable option.   
I‚Äôll seek a second opinion for anything serious but edit comments often have multiple perspectives along with multiple sources if you‚Äôre willing to dig a little.

More specifically, I add "site: reddit.com" so it only searches reddit. Also, for anyone wanting to search for a a certain thing, put that phrase in quotation marks.

Almost always! The alternative is ending up on Wikipedia or random blogs that could be saying anything to get readers. I prefer getting a reddit thread with actual anonymous people‚Äôs testimonies, I always learn a lot   
Definitely, reddit users would never say anything to get attention.  We prefer to be inconspicuous and not keep track of 'likes' Btw I don't trust Wikipedia either, when has  it ever helped anyone?

I want to thank you. I got an advance copy of a game that hasn't been released in the states yet and I've been needing some help. Google searches were getting me nowhere. Then I thought "gasp!! I bet Reddit users have a thread for this game and that there are people all over the world playing it and then they can answer questions and I can answer questions!!" So you just made my day, literally! Thank you!!  
Psst, which game?

DAE get so anxious about the stuff you need to get done in your day that you end up just wallowing in a cesspit of procrastination as your anxiety continues to grow while you sit there doing nothing, rather than just getting up and doing it?
I struggle with this daily. Each night I resolve to do better. Alas, the abyss consumes again.

This is so me!! I‚Äôve learned to put small boundaries in place to help motivate me. Even though I work three jobs and earn less than $25,000 a year, I always make sure to keep $60 every month for a cleaning lady. I make the money an absolute priority. This is enough to keep me sane. I‚Äôll invite a (close, understanding) friend over to sit in my kitchen and drink tea and chat, while I clean my kitchen. I‚Äôll trade homemade cakes and treats with my neice every 10 months or so, and she comes over and helps me organize stuff. I do the same with my small garden. If you are willing to let people in to your circle, and try to put aside the shame of not being motivated, you can find some creative ways to cope. The shame is toxic, and holds us back. And we aren‚Äôt shameful xx  
Hm, wonder if this is what I feel. I'm definitely unmotivated.  My job is so fucking easy to me but it's hella boring. The only reason I'm still there is because of the decent pay.  I'm not motivated to look for more, and I often even lack motivation to do things that I want or used to love.  I've straight up told my closest friend that I've lost motivation, but she's the only one I've told.  I'm working thru it by brute mental force at this point. I guess my only motivation is money? Like I just want to be lazy for a month while still getting paid.  
There is lots of research studies out there that tell us money doesn‚Äôt motivate us. (Once we have the basics - food, rent, shelter.) how long are you going to be able to keep up the brute mental force? Good on you for keeping going, because a job is better than no job, but I wonder how much energy is being sucked out of you by the brute energy. Maybe try to start small - really small. Treat yourself. Have a favourite coffee on the way to work twice a week. Force yourself to compliment a co worker on his nice red sweater. Buy yourself a pair of your favourite socks. Wear them. Maybe a haircut that makes you feel extra fly. Reach out to random people on the bus - just a shared smile. But really notice when you‚Äôre doing these things. Hey, I am wearing my favourite socks with the flamingos on them. Good for me! Hey, that co worker I never really got along with seemed super pleased that I noticed his sweater. I did a nice thing, brightened his day. Best of luck to you. Life can be hard, we have to do little things for each other.  
 (Once we have the basics - food, rent, shelter.)  That's the key. Studies have shown that people who can afford to be unemployed have drastic spikes in happiness.  But those that are unemployed and in financial distress have that happiness tank.  It seems pretty "duh", but it's interesting when you delve deeper into it. I've been unemployed for about 6 months.  The intention was only to be that way for about 3, so I had a small nest egg to float me and I was extremely happy focusing on new skills, hobbies, and enjoying life.  Then the pandemic hit and finding a job was now impossible, and my safety zone came and went.   Now even though these little things once brought me great joy and self-development, I can't bring myself to be productive and do any of it because I'm just consumed with anxiety and fear that I won't be able to find a job. I have no motivation to cook, clean, or continue my studies.  Happiness comes from doing the things you love, but basic needs will always need to be met first. I'm not motivated by money, I'm motivated by living the life I want.  Unfortunately I need at least some money to do so. Therefore money = happiness, to an end.

Where do you live. Not sure how it is now with the pandemic but I made 30k one year as a part time server with three days off. It's honest work and I worked hard for that admittedly.

Ugh, yes. Or not doing THAT thing because there's something ELSE that has more of a priority, or there is something I started but didn't finish. But thinking about doing that thing that has greater priority gives me anxiety so then I just end up doing nothing instead.

Haha yep! Some days I‚Äôm an OCD cleaner, some days I sit and watch tv in near tears over all the dishes, laundry, and organizing to do.  Sometimes just picking out one thing to do helps start the day. You‚Äôll feel better once one thing is off the list.  
I have been in the same boat. What really helped me, (actually straight up solved the problem) was audiobooks. Once I started listening to them, I started finding excuses to do chores around the house so I could knock out more of my book. I couldn't just sit and listen to it while doing nothing, I'd get too bored.  
This is actually a great idea!! I love audiobooks, as long as the voice isn‚Äôt annoying ha!  
A few of my recent favorites: (been through about 100 in the past year) 11-22-63 - Stephen King Pet Semetary - Stephen King The Fourth Monkey - J.D. Barker The Way of Kings - Brandon Sanderson (book 1 of the best series I've ever read) The Expanse series - James S A Corey  The Blade Itself - Joe Abercrombie These have the best narrators out of all the audiobooks I've listened to.

Yup! I have been this way my whole life and I‚Äôve been making an effort to change it, slowly. I try to be kind to myself, the reason why I‚Äôm putting it off is because I want the result to be perfect. But how can ‚ÄúI‚Äù make something perfect? As soon as I start harping on how great I want something to turn out, I psych myself out of even trying.  Now I wake up and give myself 2 priorities. They don‚Äôt have to be big, just something I want/need to do. I owe it to myself to show up for myself, to TRY. Set 2 priorities (example; mine yesterday were (1) to make a beat loop and (2) clean the dishes). I made a beat loop and it was terrible, BUT I tried. I sat down and go it DONE whether it was good or not. Next time I will be more prepared, next time it won‚Äôt be perfect either, but damn at least I tried for myself. Look up the Pomodoro technique for organizing your time as you work. Very helpful

This is 100% me. People always talk about the fight or flight response but they always forget or don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs actually fight, flight or freeze, and I‚Äôm a million times a freezer. When I get too overwhelmed by my anxiety I completely freeze up and shut down mentally. I have to try and break whatever task up into smaller parts, then break those parts into smaller parts ad infinitum until I get to a process I can complete, and start taking on each of those microscopic parts until I can complete a task. Or part of a task lol.

I used to do this so bad. It was usually due to my mental state. If I was in an abusive relationship/if my overall environment was not great. I found taking little steps and positive mantras really helped me. Saying things like, "if I do this then it's better than nothing." And I could slowly manage to tell myself that I was being productive because I did 1 single thing that day, but eventually the positivity for this grew and I did 2 things on another day, then it keps growing. I would have break days within this and I realized I was still doing better than when I was doing nothing at all. It slowly made me happier with myself to start. Long story short. Yes. I very much understand this feeling but I give into it way less than I used to. I find the anxiety is the drive to move, so we just need to listen. Even if that's just 10 jumping jacks, a good meal and some water to start. <3

Yes, and the worst part is when it's something I enjoy doing such as writing.  It become an insurmountable task and then I hate myself for not doing what I like because of that fear.

Honestly, that's exactly why I like the reddit format. I like the 'outdated', text heavy look for reddit. Maybe it's just because I'm used to it, I don't know. Anyone else feel this way?  
I like it way better on the computer. I don't use the mobile site even on my phone because I can't stand it

Nobody in their right mind uses Reddit‚Äôs official mobile app. Try Apollo. Moved over reluctantly after Alien Blue died a slow death.

I thought that I was the only one... The new design is not only bad looking, but makes it more difficult to browse. It makes reddit more like facebook and every other shitty website cos 'hur dur I dont understand computer reddit'

Just Use RES for that.. But Yeah I use mobile mostly too lel  
Wait I have res... is there an easy back button I‚Äôm missing?   
No but theres a small button that opens the OP.  You can click it kind of like an on off and it opens the post even if it was an external link image. There are also other downloadable scripts to customize it

I've only been using it on my computer for like 6 years now, never thought I'd be a minority  
Well, I actually have been using reddit for only a couple of days hehe

READ THE SIDEBAR IT'S ON THE SIDEBAR LOOK AT THE SIDEBAR Yo playa, What Sidebar? Mobile For Life  
You can see the sidebar on mobile.  
It took me far longer than I'd care to admit to know that That was The Sidebar. I'm a Reddit Is Fun guy and maybe... 25% of the time "error loading sidebar"  
DAE only uses reddit on a smartphone?
I have nothing against the website, I just don‚Äôt browse reddit at home. Usually in between classes.  
DAE only uses reddit on a smartphone?
I am part of the dying breed that only uses reddit on a PC. I am actually surprised at how quickly it changed in the space of a few years, I still remember when nearly everybody was using it on a computer and hardly anybody on a phone.  
DAE only uses reddit on a smartphone?
Yup, but finding it a battery hog at the moment..  
Really? It runs just fine, battery consumption is not too much on my phone, and i use a 4 year old IPhone 5.   
Yeah, it could be me just on it a lot, but when I check the battery usage it consumes more that YouTube.  I still love using it though haha  
Yup, but finding it a battery hog at the moment..  
There's a few different apps out there, I haven't used the default one but the Reddit Is Fun app doesn't seem to drain battery much at all. Especially not on night mode!

The computer site is simply un-usable. It‚Äôs overwhelming   
That is interesting, because I prefer the computer site over mobile. What makes you think it's unusable?   
[deleted]  
This is exactly why I prefer the desktop site. I don't want color, or quick moving, I basically want every website to look as much like cragislist as possible. Just list everythign in the simplest form possible.   
That is interesting, because I prefer the computer site over mobile. What makes you think it's unusable?   
Too much clutter, it‚Äôs anyone with ocd and/ or anxiety‚Äôs worst nightmare. I breathe heavy just looking at it. Jk but....  
That is interesting, because I prefer the computer site over mobile. What makes you think it's unusable?   
Too clicky  
WTF does that mean? Doesn't the app have the same links, up/down votes, comment buttons? Is the app "too tappy"?

I don't know how all of you do that. The site on mobile is terrible. I don't think I could even browse reddit without having tabs. Typing on a phone is worse, finding links for your comments is worse, many website other than like imgur and gfycat load worse on mobile. In general the mobile experience, for me, is just shit compared to a desktop interface (but that is also basically how I feel about every website ever, I hate apps compared to actual websites)

About 99% of the time I use Reddit is Fun for Android. I never get to enjoy when I'm gilded because the apps features makes gold a bit redundant.

That would be me. I don't understand how one uses anything else to browse through Reddit. I don't know, I'm just comfortable doing it via my phone. Damn I sound like a brat.

DAE continue to type their full sentence even when their keyboard freezes so they can watch the sentence type itself up when it unfreezes?
Yes! I love doing that. It happens on my phone and on my work computer. I like seeing what the results are when it unfreezes because I want to see if I could type everything correctly without being able to see it in real time.   
My phone is so old that it often freezes and then blurts out random duplicates of the last few words or the last few words or sentences sentences.   
I see what your phone did there

DAE like sleeping with a fan blowing on them but being burried under the covers?
I MUST have fan white noise to sleep. If the fan isn't on. I won't be sleeping. I've had a fan break and have to go out in the middle of the night to buy a new fan.

You may find this useful in your day-to-day life. Try it set to pink noise, with oscillation on.  
I'm terrified that this pacific noise will be interrupted by a "BINGGGG" Windows alert sound if I leave my speakers on all night.

i do this too, every night. i have a fan that sits a few feet away from my head that i turn on right before i go to bed. i turn the fan away from me most nights though because it's too cold with the fan blowing on me. but yeah i can't sleep without the white noise the fan gives me.

Love it. If I had my way I would turn the air down to the 60's so I can snuggle in a quilt, but the fascists at W.I.F.E. keep saying their cold.  
I keep mine on 60, use a fan, and sleep on down, with down pillows, and a faux fur coverlet......No one's house feels as good as mine.

You gotta wake up in the morning and simplely put  ... it's fucking sucks leaving that warm bubble for that frozen tundra; its made me late for school, work, sports... you name it! I wish there was something that could gradually warm up the room just as im waking up so when i actually NEED to get out of bed and start my day its warm and cumfy.... (which leads me to another story ill lightly touch on only because it seems pretty relevant to my story....Rich ppl what the fuck are you spending your money on cars n huge houses you're never in for??? spend it ALL on your bed room its the ONLY room you own that you really spend time in. That's what I would do.. get some crazy ass heating system that will do what I described above some blankets made by all types of old ladies from around the world and have the BEST SLEEP FUCKING EVER.

Personally, I don't like fans. For some reason, the inconsistent streams of air makes me feel a little sick, gives me slight headaches, or makes by body rapidly ping-pong between feeling hot and cold. This effect worsens when the fan pans back and forth.  I'm not sure why this happens.

Buy one of those Dyson Airblades maybe?  
As a fan sleeper, getting an Air Multiplier was one of the best decisions I ever made. The Airblade is the hand dryer.

Try one of these and you'll thank me. No chopping air, it's a finned cylinder that rotates and pushes the air out.. Think of an old-fashioned steamboat. The paddle wheel on the back? Yup. That's what causes the air to flow.  
Nice try Lasko 4904 Space-Saving Pivoting Task Fan salesperson.  
I'm out of work then, because I can't find that sumbitch anywhere.

They dry my contacts out, but if I sleep bare-eyed, I like them.  
You don't take your contacts out for sleepytimes?  If I don't, I wake up with them glued to my eyeballs.

I need some sort of sound too.  Can't sleep in complete silence.  But I also keep the air conditioner on late into November.  I can't sleep in a warm room and need it cool.  even if I'm buried under several blankets, I need to be able to uncover and cool off when needed. this, of course, pisses off my girlfriend.  she needs it oppressively warm in the room.  so she has to keep an electric blanket or heating pad on through the winter (because I turn the heat way down).  needless to say, we both have different sets of covers.  I'm usually under a sheet and a fleece blanket when needed but she has a thick down comforter, blanket(s), and heating pad or blanket.

While I am guilty of this and absolutely love it. This has to be a behavior limited to Americans.

I prefer to be bundled up in a cold room. My face needs to be cold, but my body needs to be warm. In Duluth, MN, in the coldest days of winter, I would open the window and bundle up in my double thick mink blanket. I frequently ended up with snow on my dresser.

This girl I was kind of talking to in high school took some medication that turned her pee bright green. She grabbed me in the hallway and pulled me into the bathroom. I thought we might be about to get into some filthy bathroom action, but instead she dragged me in to look at her pee in the toilet.

Making someone look at your pee is pretty filthy.  
I dunno.  I'd be stoked to see some oddly green pee.

My pee is rarely clear or a decent yellow color, I forget to drink water always. Also, I had to get my kidneys checked out and had a catheter placed and filled my bladder up (they needed to watch my kidneys function) and I had to pee after obviously and it came out freezing cold because of whatever liquid they put inside me. Cold pee? Now THATS a wild ride.

I always push (red, but I mean go for the mix; why not) beets on the younger generation at family holiday gatherings.  When they're young they're horrified at the fact their poop and pee becomes pigmented.  Even that said, I still (as recently as earlier this month) ate beets, went to have a squirt, and still thought for a second or two that I'd contracted mild death.  tl;dr: Beets have color compounds that emerge in both your #1 and #2 and they are goddamn delicious (EDIT: The beets, not the leftovers, you brutes). You only get your body for so long. Check beets out and have a laugh!

Urine being clear is one of my pet peeves, because it's not better for you.  Your urine is suppose to be straw colored.  If you're peeing clear then you're stripping nutrients from your body.

Dark orange after my work day today, and that's fairly common. I have paruresis so I don't go to the bathroom at work, but I also intentionally don't drink much while I'm there (or eat anything either till I get home). Just a few sips of a Capri Sun throughout the day to keep me awake, don't even finish it usually.   
Wait you don't go to the bathroom at all? Do you not have bathroom stalls there?

When I was a child my pee was usually green for some reason, but one day I went to the bathroom and my pee was yellow. So I called to my mom "Mom! My pee is yellow!" and she kind of looked at me wired and said "Oh... That's nice hun"

Always and my kids are trained to check too. It‚Äôs such a simple way to teach a child to know when they need to drink more water.  
Or they could just use their thirst, which is what it‚Äôs for.   
Some people just don't have the thirst gene. I am rarely thirsty even when I know I haven't had any fluids for way too long.

For me, clear urine always means I've drank a lot of alcohol...and they say alcohol dehydrates you... Seriously though,  how is that?  
I think it‚Äôs that your body is evacuating urine it shouldn‚Äôt be, so all that clear pee might be your body throwing away perfectly good hydration

It's sad because I'm so sleep deprived but it's the best part of my day. I play stardew valley for the whole night to morning just watering crops, milking cows, pure silence except the games music. I get hypnotized at a certain point and can't stop lol. It's a problem  
Had to stop myself playing Stardew Valley last night. Only 1 artifact away from getting the sewer key so I can change my fishing perk. It‚Äôs so addictive, and I love the grinds of the game. Playing Runescape as a child has made me a masochist that enjoys these types of grinds, and it helps to appease my ADHD by setting goals for myself in game.

It's not that I don't want my freetime to end, I just don't want the next day to begin.  
Yea I've been slipping into this feeling, and I don't like it. I feel like the worst part of my day is the moment I wake up. And I don't even really dislike my job at all, it's perfectly fine! But when I get off work all I want to do is nothing, and keep doing that for as long as possible. The concept of trading sleep to keep doing nothing and avoid starting the next day seems bananas, yet here I am...  
This is me. My job is fine, good even. I‚Äôve been lucky to work from home and nothing has changed for me financially. But I want to do nothing after work and I stay awake way too late doing nothing. And then I‚Äôm tired the next day, and the cycle just repeats. Being alive is exhausting. Lol.  
It's hard for me because my fiancee is a totel extrovert. She's been working from home and I've still been going in to the office since I'm essential. When I get home all she wants to do is catch up and go for walks, all the social stuff she's missed out on all day. And all I want to do is tune out the world. My dad needed me to run a quick errand for him the other day after work and I had to talk myself out of a bubbling rage at the audacity of him to ask me to run a 10 minute errand. I wish I wasn't like this.

Literally doing this rn! I‚Äôm currently living with my fam cause of corona and they‚Äôre so loud.

I wonder if I‚Äôll still do this if I‚Äôm able to live in an apartment on my own  
I feel this! Especially the hovering lmao my siblings are so bad with that  
what do you guys mean by hovering? at first I thought it was a typo for hoovering and you were annoyed at excessive vacuuming  
It‚Äôs when someone (usually a sibling, girlfriend or someone else close) idly follows you around, maybe making small talk, checking out what you‚Äôre up to.. looking over your shoulder, or standing in a doorway. It‚Äôs a boredom thing.

Get up early instead. It's hard at first, but it's really great once you're in the swing of it.  
Just woke up, this is too early for me it hurts. Going back to sleep. I don‚Äôt know how you do this üòî  
If you think about it like, "I have to get myself out of bed, then I have to do blah blah, it's going to be terrible, etc." you'll just fall back to sleep. One foot on the floor. Just one foot, the rest of you can stay in bed. Hell, you can fall back to sleep for a while if it strikes you, but leave that foot on the floor. Give that a few days, you're getting there. Next step is to put your phone somewhere out of reach. If you want that phone, you've gotta go get it. No more lying in bed on your phone in the morning.  After you do that habitually, give yourself reasons to get out of bed. "Man, eggs sound good for breakfast," "I should let the dog out," "I should check the news," etc. Once you leave your bedroom, SHUT THE DOOR. If you're dog tired, wait an hour and then go back to bed. Do this until you feel less lethargic and can stomach staying awake for longer periods of time.  Add a task that you'll do every morning, make it habitual. It could be something stupid like looking out a window, taking an inventory of the fridge, etc.  This is about breaking your bad habit (i.e., sleeping in), and you're replacing that with a good habit.  
Damn, you have a good point. Baby steps it is. You definitely called me out on the lying in bed on the phone thing, currently can‚Äôt put it down but I promise I will right now lol. Thanks for the encouragement ma friend

Yes! Nobody wanting anything from me.  It's awesome but then I sleep until noon. I have tried working a graveyard shift but I don't want to be awake to WORK...so there's that...

It's just so peaceful at night. I'll even wake up early to savor that before the sunrise quiet too.

Yes but only cause I have horrible insomnia üò©  
Hey, I‚Äôm just reading about insomnia right now. Trying a sleep clinic might help. I used to have insomnia but I don‚Äôt any more. I didn‚Äôt go to a sleep clinic or use any sleep aid regularly, but I did make a lot of significant changes. It still flares up from time to time but for the most part I sleep 8-9 hours a night without waking up in my sleep. It takes me less than 5 minutes to get sleepy, and usually about half an hour until I‚Äôm fully asleep.  
My problem is I can‚Äôt seem to turn my thoughts off so I‚Äôll sit up thinking to myself for hours. I think a lot of my insomnia was tied to my mental illnesses. I‚Äôve gotten help and am on meds recently and I‚Äôve noticed my sleeping is much better. It‚Äôs so weird and nice to not have all these thoughts when I try to lay down to sleep üòä not sure if it‚Äôs completely cured though cause I still can go a long time without sleep. I might look into a sleep clinic though at some point if I need to. Thank you for the suggestion! Falling asleep in less than 5 minutes would be amazing. I‚Äôve always been jealous of people that can do that lol  
Yeah mental health was definitely the biggest factor for me. Reducing stress, lots of therapy, lots of meditation, and a very supportive spouse is what did it for me.

I do this all the time because I secretly love reading more than anyone knows. My days are just so busy that I don't have the time to read so I stay up till about 2am just reading silently and i wake up at 5.45 for school, i think it's very unhealthy but atst I'm not ready to let my work take over my life and I'm still trying to find a way I can relax.  
I do this, too! I've spent so much on e-books for my Kindle app on my phone, despite also using Overdrive. I will stay up the entire night to finish a new book, so I try to limit myself to re-reading old favorites. What do you usually read?  
I love fantasy books like Throne of Glass, the mortal instruments etc. or books like a thousand perfect notes, paper towns, 13 reasons why, we are okay and so on and i read on quotev

I do that every single night. Sometimes even push myself to stay up when I‚Äôm clearly dead sleepy and just wanna lay down. It‚Äôs unhealthy but I do it. And if anybody finds a cure to that, let me know. It‚Äôs so peaceful at night and like it‚Äôs my peak time to think and process everything. The best time to introspect and all that jazz.  
I'll be dead tired, basically falling asleep, and I'll still be on my phone in bed. endlessly scrolling

DAE feel like they can‚Äôt enjoy their day if they‚Äôre expecting something or doing something later in the day?
Yes!!!! Back when I worked at a grocery store, my schedule was all over the place. Any time I was scheduled to go into work at like 4pm, I‚Äôd sit anxiously all day waiting for my shift. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt do anything fun beforehand in case I got carried away and missed my shift. I still don‚Äôt understand how some people can go on hikes, shopping trips, etc. and then just waltz into work without problems. My anxiety couldn‚Äôt handle that.  
I have a coworker who goes to the shore before her 5pm shift pretty frequently. For me, that‚Äôs the kind of thing anxiety attacks are made from. I have no clue how she could possibly manage that.   
I mean I work in a shop overlooking the beach so maybe that's different for me.   
For reference I‚Äôm about an hour from the beach where I live.

I have a mom who is always late. It isn‚Äôt that she is being disrespectful of others time, she just has this anxious drive to get things done and has no idea how to estimate and manage time. She is all over the place and can barely keep her head on straight. I get it because I‚Äôm exactly the same way. However I realize this and so I get super anxious about being on time. So much so that I do exactly what you describe. I sit at home watching the clock for 10 hours because if I do anything else I‚Äôm afraid Ill lose track of time and be late. Now Im struggling to let myself (and my daughter) enjoy life a little even when we have appointments. It‚Äôs silly to get a 1 year old dressed and ready to go three hours early and expect them to sit and do nothing until it‚Äôs time to go.  It‚Äôs a weird balancing act and I‚Äôm not super great at it yet.   
This sounds exactly like why so many people with ADHD have anxiety problems too. After spending their lives constantly being late and losing track of time all the consequences lead to anxiety any time there's a deadline. Plus there's a certain amount of relying on the anxiety for motivation to make up for not being able to do it in a more healthy way.  
Anxiety as motivation is a sign of ADHD? I can relate, also I think you can get addicted to that motivation of doing something last minute like it‚Äôs a super power or something, trying to break that

You just give yourself enough time to get to work after you do fun stuff. It's not hard unless you can't tell time. Can I ask how old you were when you had the grocery store job?  I could understand this coming from someone with no work experience.

i used to be the same way. something that has helped me is setting an alarm on my phone at a time that gives me plenty of time to prepare for whatever event is coming (getting dressed and prepared for work, getting home to receive your package, etc.) and vowing to let myself relax and do other things until the alarm goes off.

I used to work nights, and could not fully enjoy my day because I knew I had to work. For instance, I would not go anywhere that could even potentially make me late, such as drive out for a hike or go to a movie. What if there was a traffic issue? Glad I‚Äôm over it, but it literally took years!

I have to make a thesis. It started in December and still I can't enjoy my months till I pass it. Even if I mostly do nothing, I can't enjoy going on walks, cycling, watching movies, etc.

DAE get weirdly anxious before a planned phone call, video call, or meeting even if it is very casual and even your friend?
Heck yea. Sometimes Sometimes, I even cry before that. Or I vomit. It‚Äôs called social anxiety my friend. It‚Äôs very annoying  
Yeah I can relate to that. I haven't been so nervous about calls that I've vomited but I have been that scared before meeting people in person. I am a pretty anxious person in general but sometimes I feel like I'm going overboard. Sorry that you face that it's just really sucky :/  
Oh, I don‚Äôt vomit before calls! I‚Äôm not that nervous either. But when I‚Äôm meeting w friends and even tho it‚Äôs casual, I sometimes vomit. It sucks.

I used to have the vomiting before meet ups so bad (with me it was almost always when I saw the person in question, it only stopped when I felt really comfortable around the person). I worked through it and am so happy now, but I know what it feels like. It sucks, I know. I'm so sorry you're going through it.

DAE get weirdly anxious before a planned phone call, video call, or meeting even if it is very casual and even your friend?
Yup. I get super anxious anytime I have to call anyone outside of my immediate family. After having a baby, I really struggled with needing to call and schedule all his checkups. It's for his well-being so I muster the courage, but I wish I didn't have to talk myself into it for days before making the call.

Yes, social anxiety and a phone phobia. When I was a kid I explained this feeling as "the phone is sucking out my soul" but may just be a feeling of not having all the visual queues needed to determine whether or not someone is understanding me/ mocking me. Now my work is trying to force me on phones and I may have a break down. Any advice on how to overcome? (Already highly medicated)

When you call someone and it goes to voicemail so after the brief wave of relief you nope out of there and hang up before the beep so you can thoroughly plan what you‚Äôre going to say before calling again, and this time they answer and aaaaagh

The more you do it, the more comfortable you'll get. I still get anxious, but not nearly as anxious as I used to. I'm 20 now. It was the worst when I was 13-16, then I gradually learned how to cope with these situations by being subjected to them, mostly thanks to school. If you believe you can get better it will slowly happen. I've also stopped comparing myself to outgoing people (since I used to wish I was one of them), only comparing myself to my older self. Looking back, I've come so far! :) Maybe you have too, if you think about it.  
Yes you're really right. I've had to push myself a lot to get to where I am now. I still feel anxious about these things but definitely nowhere as bad as it was before

I‚Äôm terrified of phone calls, emails, any sort of correspondence. I rarely answer text messages. I‚Äôve lost friends, work, life changing opportunities because of it.  I did a stint as a lookout observer in a wildfire lookout tower. I would struggle to answer my radio check-ins or report my weather. There are like instant ramifications to not answering a radio call. Gears get set in motion and people get very nervous.  
Hey Wubsk that‚Äôs really hard. Thanks for sharing w us though. The idea of solitude in nature sounded easy enough huh? Then the reality of being required to communicate set in. I‚Äôm curious as to who made those rules and why lookout observers need to radio back anyway. Why can‚Äôt you just submit a log file by email at the end of the day? Is there anything going on out in the middle of a forest that requires live weather updates? The way I see it, just give us introverts a job we actually want. Don‚Äôt tease us w the concept of getting paid for solitude then make us talk to people on radios.  
Thanks, it got a lot easier as it went along.  Most of the towers in my district were a few hours helicopter ride from anywhere else, so there was no internet. There were phones, but the minutes were policed quite strictly.  They used the weather, cloud cover, temperature, cloud cover and type, RH, and rain gauges for calculating daily indices for how fire behaviour would be that day, or how dry forest fuels were getting. It all gets entered every day and crunched in a central computer program. They don‚Äôt like to mid a day. The reports also serve as a bit of a welfare check. When you‚Äôre out there by yourself, things can go bad fast. People have fallen down ladders, been mauled by bears, had accidents with tools. Around ten years back there was a lady who just disappeared. The investigation is still open. When she didn‚Äôt answer her radio, they sent a crew out there to check, and they found her kettle still boiling on the stove. Measures got put into place in response to that, and they take it super seriously if you don‚Äôt answer a radio message.

Definitely social anxiety. A lot of the people here giving you advice have no idea what they‚Äôre talking about. Seek professional help, anxiety is not just an ‚Äúehh, just pace around until you feel better‚Äù kind of thing. It‚Äôs an actual medical condition.

I find myself constantly trying to plan out the conversation prior to the call. I‚Äôll try to think through the whole conversation and how to respond to some questions a i think up. I recently had to do this for work. Amazingly I still manage to go off from where I planned and made the conversation a little awkward. At least I still got the job!  
DAE get weirdly anxious before a planned phone call, video call, or meeting even if it is very casual and even your friend?
Terribly. It‚Äôs easier with some friends, but not so much with others. The worst is at work - I work in an open plan office (well, was in one pre-covid) and calls to clients or suppliers were generally required about once/twice a day. I used to try and avoid this at all costs, ie trying to sort as much as possible out using email, but my boss (who loves just picking up the phone for any old thing) kept saying to me ‚Äújust pick up the phone‚Äù, ‚Äújust give so-and-so a call‚Äù. I just ignored him/made up a plausible excuse as the thought just panicked me. The open plan office just makes it 100x worse as I can‚Äôt help feeling (gotta love social anxiety) everybody around me will be listening on and judging. Agh!!!

Absolutely.  I feel the need to check everything possible before it happens, even if it‚Äôs just with family.  Then, after, I‚Äôm so drained and need to just sit by myself for a while with a cup of tea and not speaking to anyone üòÇ

I don't get anxious, but I find it very annoying. Prior to the lockdown, my family members would just call me on the phone anytime they wanted to. Since the lockdown, my Mum has discovered Zoom, and keeps on scheduling whole family Zoom chats two days in advance. It's driving me up the wall because I'm not a fan of video calling at all; it doesn't feel natural having someone's face that large right in front of me. Plus, in situations where multiple people are trying to talk at once, I tend to stay pretty quiet, because I've never been one who cared to impose my opinion on others. I'm comfortable with what I believe, and I'm not concerned with sharing it with other people. When there's a call with five people, I find I just don't really say that much seeing as only one person can talk at once. What really bugs me about it though, is that now we have set times that we're going to call, it doesn't feel relaxed or natural. It feels like a formal meeting. And as such, it sits in my mind all day that I have to be sat in front of my computer at this time. So on today, what is my day off, I still haven't felt relaxed or free. I'm not sure what was wrong with just calling on the phone every few days. Why do we now have to schedule formal meetings?  
Yeah that's pretty true I also just feel that the occasional call is great for catching up. But i also know (atleast for my life) my friends and family are way more social that I am. Two of them especially need constant connection so this lockdown life is torture for them. So I've felt more obligated to have videocalls with them to give them that source of comfort. In one way I feel alright about it but my nervousness is still there. After lockdown I'm definitely gonna go on a 100day videocall fast. Like goodbye everyone now's my real break time.  
DAE get weirdly anxious before a planned phone call, video call, or meeting even if it is very casual and even your friend?
Yes it‚Äôs gotten to the point where I really only like to FaceTime my own mom because I have a baby and I feel like people get frustrated when I have to tend to him and they can see (whereas if I‚Äôm on the phone I mute them and they don‚Äôt know). Especially my aunt. She gets so angry when I don‚Äôt give her my full attention I try to just avoid all phone calls and FaceTime because I‚Äôm trying to help my baby and she‚Äôs in the background saying ‚ÄúIF YOURE BUSY ILL JUST LET YOU GO‚Äù and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúno, I‚Äôm not busy at all, I have to tend to my infant all day everyday just let me do my thing keep talking I can hear you both‚Äù but she gets seemingly jealous and irritated that my child needs his diaper changed... but even FaceTiming my sons physical therapist for his weekly session makes me anxious just from having to talk to someone even though the lady is really awesome and nice. I just like being in my home with my guy, my baby, and my dog and avoiding human interaction but I know that only makes it worse.  
That's kinda rude of your aunt to put that pressure on you. You're totally justified because you're literally looking after your child. And yes to the last part! It resonates so much with me

Just arranged for two in a row. I have two hours to stress.  
DAE get weirdly anxious before a planned phone call, video call, or meeting even if it is very casual and even your friend?
When my in person college classes switched to online, I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to like it. Thankfully only one of my classes required weekly Zoom meetings. After a couple meetings, I just stopped activating my webcam and muted myself until I was addressed. Gotta say, reading your 1200 word essays in front of a bunch of classmates is super fucking awkward online. Our teacher also separated us into sub-groups to critique our papers together. My partners faces were visible but decided to mute themselves. So basically I can see their faces in awkward silence, while they just text in chat.  Personally, it takes a lot of mental psyching myself up to call someone normally too. I just don‚Äôt like that I can‚Äôt see them in person to guage their reactions (video-calling is weird cause of I have to see my own face and their so close up) but I have some family that gets mad if I don‚Äôt call like once a month. But she can be particularly argumentative about politics, so you have to dance on ice cubes when talking to her. So makes the experience even worse.

DAE get weirdly anxious before a planned phone call, video call, or meeting even if it is very casual and even your friend?
Yeah, it's a funny reaction to have. It's usually because I'm overthinking the social pressures involved instead of just going with the flow. Things work out a lot better if you cut off the overthinking before it gets unhealthy.

Oh yes.  All the time.  The thing that actually helped me the most was getting a job where I HAD to answer phone calls all day long.  I HATED it at first then eventually got more comfortable with it.  Once I quit that job I backslid and now I'm looking for a receptionist position again. So I'll go through the entire process again.  
That's perfect and I hope you get such a position where you are able to feel comfortable with this feelinf again!

So much so that I developed a toxic relationship with alcohol to cope with it. Have been unlearning that lately...but mostly by avoiding people.  
Ohh that must be tough for you. I'm glad that you are unlearning that and honestly even if you need to avoid people for some time to cope better that's okay. You are allowed to take time to feel better

DAE get weirdly anxious before a planned phone call, video call, or meeting even if it is very casual and even your friend?
yes it‚Äôs so bad that it happens even when i‚Äôm calling my dad. which could partly be because of my hampered relationship with him, but it also stems from the fact that i‚Äôm highly self-conscious about how i do or say things.  so before the call, i‚Äôll be fidgeting and constantly clearing my throat or going through the points i want to talk about - to prevent myself from making a complete fool of myself. i crave those type of calls that some experienced people can make or how they show on scripted media where the person is in full control of his half of the conversation, and handles it well too.  video calls are a rare thing for me, phone calls too somewhat. i feel most comfortable via text so that‚Äôs what i resort to most often. the only drawback of this tendency of mine is that - it gives an impression to others that i‚Äôm clamming up or not wanting to get along much. which can be bad cos then i start feeling lonely :( it‚Äôs a huge trouble i face, but i don‚Äôt know how to resolve it either.  
You're right especially about the part where people get the impression that you don't want to get along much. Even when I don't pick up calls and just remain texting people feel that way about me. I don't blame them but alsk I wish it was easier. Most people here have been echoing the same feeling, but there are some people who took jobs where they had to answer calls all day long. They mentioned that practice helps you to lessen the feeling of anxiousness before a call. It definitely seems worth giving a try to kinda push ourselves into this thing we're so worried about, but I also know that it will be tough to start.

DAE get weirdly anxious before a planned phone call, video call, or meeting even if it is very casual and even your friend?
Yes but only because I worked in a call center and every phone call was anticipated to be a customer bitching at you the entire time about their cable bill after refusing all of the offers you give them making things basically free because I wasn‚Äôt the agent they got before. Fuck humanity - I quit because everyday I had anxiety about every single phone call that came through retention.

I have a question tho,since everyone is saying this is social anxiety, I‚Äôm starting to think that maybe I have it? Idk, I get extremely nervous when I have to speak in front of people to the point I shake and start sweating , and my heart beats so fast and I have to really focus on breathing in and out so I can calm down  
I'm linking this article here for you to read. It may provide some clarity. But I would say that you should be careful before diagnosing yourself. There are risks to self diagnosing. You may be able to relate to a lot of the things people said in this thread, plus what is written in the previous article so you may or may not have social anxiety disorder. The best way to be sure and get help is to contact a counsellor who can accurately diagnose you. Rn due to COVID there are a lot more text applications to get in touch with mental health professionals. Texting may make you feel less nervous as well, plus the professional can give you a more accurate picture. Hope this helps a bit!

If it is a close friend then I don‚Äôt really care, but I get anxious that my family is eves dropping. I get very anxious if I‚Äôm calling a teacher or restaurant/business.  
Oh yeah, my family also tries to eavesdrop. It's pretty annoying cause then I feel self conscious when on call. How do you manage that feeling of anxiousness then?  
Good to know I‚Äôm not the only one üòÑ to deal with it I will use my heavier headphones and have the volume up higher because it keeps me from whispering and when you speak at a normal volume I find it to be a confidence booster. I also pick and choose what conversations belong over text, if you know what I mean.  
Those are good tips! I don't really have headphones like that but maybe after lockdown I may look into it for my own sanity

I'm getting more accustomed to it because of this mess. At the beginning of the year, our school had us do an assignment where we needed to do a video conference with 4 other people and discuss a technology topic like AI. It was super stressful. Four months later now though, I'm doing nearly daily video conference classes, and then Discord voice chat calls after that to work on homework. I'm numb to it now.

Strangely if its me calling them its cool. Its when people call me willy nilly for chats when Im trying to concentrate on something, then I try to split focus and fail at both the call and what I was doing. In hindsight telling people to call back later isnt as rude as staying on phone and not listening properly. Would it make you feel a little less uneasy if next time you have a planned phone call coming up, to plan your convo a little more so you know what you wanna get out of the call?

Yes! An advice: it disappears quickly with practice. It vanished for me when I started making daily calls because of my job.

Bothers me more when someone types out a question on Google and instead of selecting the question when it pops up they continue to type out the entire question anyway. Why? WHY?!   
They're probably not looking at the screen. Some people look at the keyboard when they type. Or they just don't want to pick up their hands and switch to the mouse.  
If only keyboards had arrows...

I hate it when I see someone type out a whole question when they could have used a short search term.  
I think your hate is misguided.  A lot of times I will google a full question and that exact phrasing will appear on the search results with the answer I‚Äôm looking for.  I think they have optimized the search to handle it well.  
Full questions get more specific results imo.  source: someone who was really good at that Google game   
Is that at all similar to the Wikipedia Game?

I used to be a librarian and watching people not type the full question drives me nuts.  ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I find what I‚Äôm looking for?‚Äù Because the internet is massive and you googled two words.

There used to be a game where you Googled two words and the aim was to get one single search result. Not sure if it's still going these days.

I used to cringe when I'd see people putting in full natural tlanguage sentences, but these days, Google handles them quite well.  
It really does amaze me just how well Google search works.  You search for "l o n g b o y e" and get lots of long boyes (spaced out and as one word), but if you sort the letters alphabetically and search for "b e g l n o o y" you just get a couple sites for "words that start with begl"  
The great thing about Google is you don't even have to worry about correct spelling for your search query. It knows what you are wanting to say.   
I have a friend with severe dyslexia and am amazed at how good Google is at knowing what he means   
I used to cringe when I'd see people putting in full natural tlanguage sentences, but these days, Google handles them quite well.  
Even though search engines handle it well now, I still revert to caveman typing. I.e. instead of "is the earth bigger than uranus" I just type "earth bigger uranus" and get the same, if not better, results. Another example is skipping to the source through the search instead of going to the website first. Instead of going to IMDB and searching boondocks saints I type "boondocks saints imdb". I do this for all websites. Almost no reason to ever go to a website and then find the thing you're looking for. Even works for restaurant menus.

I get frustrated when people are discussing something they don‚Äôt know about, saying ‚Äúhmmm I wonder? Guess we‚Äôll never know!‚Äù, and it‚Äôs something that can be easily googled.  I whip out my phone, quietly google it, and then when I give them the information they were curious about they act like I‚Äôm some kind of wizard.   
Just a heads up. I say that occasionally, it's because I don't care enough to google it. I realize that's very little effort to do, which illustrates how little I care.  
I also hate talking to people who have to constantly fact check every sentence I say on Google as well.  
I do this but it's not about fact checking, it's more curiosity

this is fine on mobile, most use two thumbs to type. But on a keyboard? ugh. I don't have the patience to type at 30wpm  
no way you could type 30wpm with 2 fingers. Your brain surely would have realised more fingers is better by then.

not sure how it is for blacksteyraug, but i've never felt suicidal per se. there's a difference between wishing you were dead and wanting to kill yourself. i don't think about ways to take my own life, but have definitely imagined scenarios where i die in some unavoidable accident. for me, it's just like not wanting to go to work; it's about avoiding responsibility

Our apartment has a leaky shower-window that lets all the cold hellish air of winter in, so the shower is now a nightmare torture fest. I can't even rely on getting out of bed and into the shower to turn me normal.   
Is getting that window fixed out of the question? That doesn't sound too fun.

AMA?  
Is this a suggestion? If so then ask away  
Are you in Kenya?  Are you Kenyan?  Why do they fly into the ground?  Wouldn't that damage the planes?  What kind of planes?  Why is it grass and not tarmac?

Not so much quitting, but wondering if I can drum up an excuse to call out. Every single day. "Oooh... my throat tickles a little... maybe I should call out..."

It's equally bad when your SO is retired and is either still up doing as they wish, is just going to bed as you're getting up or is still soundly sleeping. That bastard.  It's also bad then they get up a half an hour before your alarm goes off and they decide it's the perfect time to eat crunchy things in noisy wrappers while still in bed.

Why not work to retire together???

I have done that, several times. I dropped out of school and every single job I had up to now, my early 30s. It starts with that one day I gave in to the thought. I'm not going to get up today. I'm too tired, I don't feel like seeing people, I'll stay in bed. I'm not answering the phone either, tomorrow I'll figure it out. People call sick all the time, I can do that. The next day I'd do it again. I'd be too ashamed to figure it out, everyone would know I was lying and there's no rational way to explain that I "didn't feel like working". Or I'd just be feeling the same way as the day before. The next day I'd do it again. And again. A week later I'd start answering the phone, and eventually to that call about coming to clean my desk up before they dump my stuff on the street, or how my grades were beyond fixing. Spend six months to a couple years unemployed, feeling miserable and immersed in self-inflicted depression, find a job somehow, hang to it for a few months, repeat.

Been there. God have I been there. I've quit two jobs like that. FOR NO REASON. I just literally couldn't drum up enough energy to give a fuck anymore. I've come a long way since then. I'm a much better person and even though I have my bad mornings I just kinda make myself get up anyway and I always feel better afterwards.

I have the same problem, which for me stems from social anxiety leading to depression. I realised finally that much of the problem is having an unhealthy sleep pattern. If I sleep regularly and give myself at least an hour of light in the morning to "wake up" then it's not nearly so bad. The difference between me and success in life has been the distance from the bed to the floor!

You and everyone else who does this needs adderall.  Seriously dude, I can relate.  Get on it, try working for your self & exercising. IDK what your into but can you sell it? Then sell it, ebay amazon whatever. Make a web site with your new found attention span. Or learn a trade & work for yourself doing that..  You can do it, you just got to play into yourself. Not everyone is meant to have a structured life style, many need it and thrive in it, others like myself drown in it.. I was you, this is your answer. PM if you have any questions.

Yes...every morning...but on my days off I end up waking up early and ready to go because in my mind I have limited time for fun and I have to take full advantage of it...AKA drink all day.

If you feel like shit in the morning you're not sleeping enough. Yeah, this might be the result of a legitimate sleeping disorder, but it might also be the result of staying up too late. I force myself to get ready for bed 9 hours before I've set my alarm. Then I get in bed with all the lights out. No reddit, no TV, just me in a dark room. Sometimes I toss and turn for a few hours, other times I fall right asleep. But either way I'm not stimulating myself. If you're trying to stay busy till all hours, drag yourself to bed when you're about to pass out, and set an alarm for 6 hours later, you're going to hate life when said alarm goes off.   
I think I've read somewhere that you need at least 1 hour away from electric thingies before sleep. I don't do this so I don't know if it works.  I sleep like a baby anyhow.  
Use flux.  
What's a flux?  Capacitor?

I can try to be smart about money, or eating, or how I work or dress, but sleep really remains for me a mystical ritual beyond my control, organized around fear and ignorance. Honestly, I think I'm afraid to be alone with my thoughts, which drift in the dark to fears or regrets that I worry will freak me out and keep me awake; so I read until my eyes close, and wake up feeling like I tricked the spirits once again.

See, I wish I could do this. I could in college, but now that I'm working, that means my day is only 15 hours long. If I spend 9 of that actually in the office that only leaves 6 for waking up, getting ready, personal errands, eating, and maybe a little down time.  I sleep about 5 to 6 hours a night. So, I have about three extra hours a day to do things that I would feel like I was robbing myself of if I followed your plan. That's 21 hours a week; almost an entire day every week. Extrapolate that a little further and that's 45 days in a single year that I'm gaining. I feel healthy, I exercise, and I feel like I'm very aware throughout the day even when I don't have my usual two cups of coffee between 8am and 3pm.  Sometimes on the weekend I'll sleep more like seven hours or take a nap, but I just can't imagine sleeping for 9 hours every night.

At my last job I used many sick days because I didn't want to wake up. I would always space them out over a few months so it wasn't terribly obvious what I was doing. It doesnt help that I'm naturally nocturnal. Eventually I did quit that job. Now I have a job that let's me come in late. Now I wake up without an alarm, and it makes all the difference. Additionally, I haven't called in tired for months and I have all this vacation built up.  
What kind of job do you have that lets you come in late?!

I'm working on a story about a woman whose fianc√©e was lost in a dream between sleep and awake and she has to go into the dream world to find him and convince him to wake up, but he knows that if he wakes up the entire universe his dream comprises will end and that this is more important than waking up.

Recently I've come to the realization that I need to get the hell out of my current place of work. Every time I hear that alarm go off it's a reminder of how unhappy I'm going to be for the next 12 hours. I need to get my shit together and get out.

Holy cow! this is too close to my heart - I've taken so many sick days just because I wanted to sleep more.  
I've heard of some jobs which have duvet days - a day where you can call up and just stay in bed at short notice. Like a special kind of sick day, but whereby you freely admit you CBA coming in. Sadly none of my jobs have had that.

Yesterday I ended up burning my food in the toaster oven because I was taking too long to find something to watch. It's a real problem.   
I have the opposite problem. My food quite often will get cold because I can't find something to watch.

I do this with every meal. I can't stand the sound of food being chewed, and, because I need something to look at besides what's in my plate or bowl. Might as well be something I'm looking forward to watching.   
Oh I hate chewing noises, too. Growing up, we watched tv during dinner. My parents have stopped watching television nearly altogether and eating at their place is my idea of hell now.

I cringe when I'm watching people on TV eat in silence. The scraping of eating utensils against the plate AND chewing? Drives me mad. Absolutely mad.   
Is it really that bad? My whole adolescent life we would eat dinner and sometimes lunch together. We all were taught good manners and ate quietly with our mouths closed. Obviously there are some noises made like scratching a bowl, cutting meat. I always enjoyed the conversation rather than watching something and no one is interacting. When I am alone I do watch stuff though. I don't understand how something that naturally occurs when eating could drive you mad lol. It's not hard to chew quietly. Different strokes for different folks I guess

Dude same! I've developed a Pavlovian instinct where I get hungry if I'm not eating while watching GMM because I've eaten while watching it for so long.

Yup. I've had many a pizza go cold that way. Hells Kitchen is a fav indulgence makes me savor every bite. The opposite would occur as well when a new show would premier and I would just have to make myself something to eat as I watch.

I'm so glad I'm not alone. It is extremely frustrating to have your hot food in front of you and you're hungry but you can't touch it until you find something good to watch.  Most of the time I just wont make my plate or open my Friday Night Food Dipped In Gravy from my favorite Jamaican/Trinidad spot until I find something worthy to watch, that will make eating like a pig fun.......it can take what seems like hours.  There are too many movie channels and apps but still not enough.........if that makes any sense.  Happy movie hunting.

Yes. I am not a fan at all of focusing on myself eating. I love cooking and enjoy the taste, but I don't want enough quiet in my mind to contemplate every bite. My fiance meanwhile will chow down on his food in the car on the way home.  
I could never eat while driving. I don't think I could even focus on enjoying my meal over all the road rage I experience here in NY.  
I tell myself every other driver is an off duty cop.  Keeps me from getting angry at people on the road.

For me its books. I love to read and eat at the same time. I've waited until I found a super good one to read. It's a habit I started at a very young age.  
How do you do it? I am afraid of staining my books by mistake :(

I feel you. Last year, my phone screen was completely broken, but my phone still worked. I had an iPod touch that connected to my phone and my calls and texts would come through there, but it felt so good to message everyone saying, ‚Äúhey my phone broke so i can‚Äôt really respond to messages right now,‚Äù and ignoring any messages i got afterwards. I was out of town for a couple of months, so my friends and family understood that I probably wouldn‚Äôt get a replacement until I came back. Didn‚Äôt check texts or social media for like two months, only replied to important messages to let everyone know I was okay lol. Most blissful two months of my life. I go back and forth though. Sometimes I‚Äôm really good at replying to people. Other times I just wanna turn my phone off forever.

If I‚Äôve been really social or work/life has been intense or stressful then I‚Äôll need some major alone/recharge time and might spend 24-72 hours hiding out in my house/room avoiding contact with most of the world. But it feels good not bad or sad. I need it to recharge and I try to enjoy every second of it and not feel bad about taking that time for myself. Edit; I did a personality test once that said I‚Äôm 60% introvert and that sounds about right. I think I‚Äôm an over achieving introvert lol Edit; I‚Äôd just like to pat myself on the back for saying overachieving introvert instead of underachieving extrovert. Way to be my own friend! That‚Äôs new :)  
I need a recharge time after doing social things too. Being out doing things drains me.  
introvert  
Idk who downvoted you, because that's true.

What test was it?  
I think it was the MBTI.  
i got INFP-T, which apparently means i‚Äôm the exact opposite of what most employers value in every way. my main suggested careers are things like ‚Äúart‚Äù and ‚Äúmusic‚Äù, and while i love those things my likelihood of making a living from those things is very low (I= introverted, N= intuitive, meaning pretty much stoned hippie thought pattern, F= feely/emotional, P= disorganized/indecisive, and then the tacked on T for ‚Äútumultuous‚Äù pretty much means mentally unwell so yeah)

Smoke, Covid, election, economy. I want to stay in bed, covers over my head, refusing to engage with all the other humans who have made this possible  
Reading your comment lying on bed with covers over my head because I feel depressed by smoke, pandemic, elections, and all the stupid hateful fucks out there, I can totally understand how you are feeling.

Definitely. I go through cycles when I want to be around people. Then after I‚Äôm around them, I come home drained. I recharge through spending time alone. Repeat the process. It feels like 98% of the time, I‚Äôm a sloth who talks to people. After a while. The other 2%, I‚Äôm a golden retriever with the zoomies wanting to talk with everyone. The 2% is exhausting.

For sure... just deleted my Insta and Facebook - I just think those forms of Social Media are toxic af and cant be dealing with them. Busted out my old comic books and making my way through Watchmen and listening to new albums as well! Not always a bad thing to want to spend time with yourself.  
i‚Äôve been contemplating deleting all my social media too, i just want to be away from the world and be in my own (if that makes sense)

I‚Äôve just deleted my Facebook because it just became very toxic. For starters everyone thinks they‚Äôre a politician and there‚Äôs just debates left, right and centre over everything but the kitchen sink and when I‚Äôm already feeling shit I want to see and read dumb shit to cheer myself up, not read a bunch of arguments about Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbin haha. I then broke up with my bf a few months ago and that just opened the gates of guys sliding in your DMs you haven‚Äôt spoken to for years and not getting the hint when you ignore them because they‚Äôre creeps, and I still had my ex on Facebook because we‚Äôre still on civil terms and there were just some comments of his that were really pissing me off, so I just decided it was time to delete the app and so far I‚Äôm not regretting it. Insta I find a little easier to stay on because I‚Äôve set my account to private and only have people on there that I talk to regularly (As opposed to Facebook in which I had people added from school who I barely talk to) that and over half the accounts I follow on Insta are wrestling related so my timeline is just spammed with WWE and AEW content lol.

I logged out of then because I use them for dating apps but God do I want to delete them

Yes, and it is usually a sign of depression.  It might be helpful to seek counseling. It was and continues to be helpful for me!

So what exactly should depressed people do then? Continue to be depressed? Pile on the health risks and other physical changes that can result from depression (or whatever mental illness they suffer from)? Potentially harm themselves?  
As frustrating as it can be, sometimes it takes a couple of tries to find the right counselor.  If counseling isn‚Äôt helpful no matter what, then it might be time to consider seeing a psychiatrist and discussing medication to get you to a point where counseling will be helpful.

This is a sign of depression. I feel this way often too. It's a hard time when you're alone with your thoughts. I overthink and that's the worst part about being alone when you're mind is running  
usually i just sit alone in my room in the dark and enjoy the silence

DAE not ever watch movies because 90mins is ‚Äútoo much of a time commitment‚Äù, but easily watch 4 to 10 hours of tv in a single sitting with no issue?
well i read about this and its because we watch youtube alot. we learned to watch short clips that have different Topics . i have seen around 700 movie and 26 tv show . and i forced myself to see some of them. its really like a habit. but yeah i do the same thing. sometimes i even watch sully movies on tv and its easier than when i want to watch. i don't know but maybe because when i download movie i feel like i have to watch it. and we humans hate the things we have to do   
I love youtube but sometimes I spend to much time on there. It's my main form of TV watching but the short videos mean I spend more time scrolling around looking for something intersting than actually watching things.

Nevermind movies, sometimes a full 40-50 minute episode seems too long, so I end up watching a bunch of 20 minute sitcom episodes in a row instead.  
The worst of all are long pilots.  Way to kill off a potential audience.

It seems like a commitment issue. You can prepare to spend an hour and a half watching or film but after 2-3 episodes or YouTube videos you can easily turn off.   
Woah. Look at this guy over here. He can easily escape youtube. Tell us your secret.   
Pretty easy when the youtube algorithm fills my feed with all kind of shit that i have no interest in. Honestly i feel like it was way better back in the day  
Woah. Look at this guy over here. He can easily escape youtube. Tell us your secret.   
There‚Äôs so much garbage on YouTube that I think it‚Äôs easier to escape it then get sucked in in the first place.

My boyfriend is like this and it drives me crazy. I‚Äôll suggest a movie to watch, and he never wants to because ‚Äúit‚Äôs too long‚Äù but then he‚Äôll sit on the couch next to me watching random stuff for 4 hours.  I‚Äôve fully embraced my laziness.

Yes, but it works the other way around too. If I want to spend time with my boyfriend, I want to watch a movie because that way he's committed to me for atleast that time. If we watch a show, I'm scared he's not gonna want to watch the next episode and our cozy-time is cut short!  
Oof I‚Äôm sorry. That‚Äôs really sad.  
How is it sad? I didn't mean he would run away from me or doesn't like hanging out, just that he would get tired of the show or something. But if you don't like a movie, you usually still pull through.

90 Minutes? Movies made in the last 10 years are almost all 2 hours minimum.   
But there were movies made before that too.

I used to do this... Then I realized I can just stop watching the movie and start it up again. My husband doesn't understand how I can watch 30-45mins of a movie one night and continue it the next night. I just can. But then again I'm good at remembering plot points and he isn't. So...

DAE when they notice someone's typo, look at their keyboard to see if the wrong letter is near the correct letter?
It depends on how bad the typo is.  Like sometimes you have to, just to try to figure out how in the hell they screwed up the word.  
It‚Äôs ether dyslexia, a second language, a kid, someone who hasn‚Äôt seen the word much on paper (those rules are really inconsistent. It is one of the hardest languages on earth.) Anyways Dyslexia will have to stare at a kids juice box wondering why your eyes can‚Äôt unsee the word bitch, even though you know it‚Äôs wrong. Never put anything past dyslexia. Especially since many people go undiagnosed and un aided.  
What does the juice box part mean??

i thought the slang term ‚Äúfinna‚Äù came from someone making a typo when trying to say ‚Äúgonna‚Äù and it just stuck.  
This is actually just a relaxed pronunciation of ‚Äúfixing to‚Äù, the same way ‚Äògonna‚Äô is ‚Äúgoing to‚Äù, ‚Äògotta‚Äô is ‚Äúgot to‚Äù, etc. Edit: semantics.  
Actually it‚Äôs closer to ‚Äòfixing to‚Äô it has the same use as gonna, except it‚Äôs that you‚Äôre about to do it instead of I‚Äôm ‚Äògonna do that right now‚Äô.  Eg: I‚Äôm finna go to the bathroom

No. Sometimes my typos aren‚Äôt because the letters are next to each other, it‚Äôs more like I got some wires crossed in my brain.

Nah, it‚Äôs just making a mistake. I don‚Äôt have dyslexia. I did great in school and scored in the 99% percentile on the ACT.  
Dyslexia isn‚Äôt a measure of intelligence. Also what was said was crossed wiring. A common was dyslexia is described by both dyslexics and Doctors.

Yeah, I was thinking about that a year ago when someone posted this very same question almost verbatim.  Well done, OP.

Yep. Usually a good yet subtle indicator the girl you're texting with, has found someone more interesting. It's a small thing, and it's never wise to assume, but i have enough self respect to tell someone that if they can't properly write with the QWERTY keyboard provided with them on their phone and use proper grammar and punctuation, they aren't intelligent enough to be dating to begin with. This whole "OMG so Mary's BFF went down to the P.A.R.K. w her gf n dey had jst da best tim" crap might've flown with T9, but phones have full keyboards now.  
Or maybe she's become so comfortable around you that she relaxes while typing and it was actually a subtle indicator she's into you.  
DAE (Did) used to think, when you were a kid, that stop lights were controlled by somebody sitting in a room full of surveillance monitors pressing buttons to change the lights when they felt it was time?
Yep! Lol I imagined them in a little office under the street with switches to control their intersection. I imagined one person at each intersection.  I‚Äôd forgot about this! Thanks for a laugh!  
I imagined them being controlled by some fat guy sitting in a small shack type of building out in the middle of the desert.

Does you guy have glasses too?  
I don‚Äôt remember but he probably did. He was fat and balding and he ate snacks while on the job.  
Yep! Lol I imagined them in a little office under the street with switches to control their intersection. I imagined one person at each intersection.  I‚Äôd forgot about this! Thanks for a laugh!  
I thought they had scales under each intersection judging how many cars were waiting by the weight. Once one side got heavy enough, they got to go. I like yours better though lol  
That's actually not that far off. The streets basically have magnets to tell how many cars have passed so they know when to switch the lights. There is also timers and such but that's a very simplified explanation.  
TIL I wasn‚Äôt as dumb as I thought about the marvels or civil engineering haha! Thanks for the info!! I guess I just assumed that everything was pretty much on timers...I can time down to almost the minute when lights on my route to work will turn green depending on time of day (and emergency vehicles). I‚Äôd never heard of the magnet thing though!

I used to and my ex actually believed it still and he was 20. He also thought the orange bumpy strips by crosswalks were weight sensors to signal for the crosswalk sign.

Fun fact: outside Ambulance stations in VIC Australia, they are. It‚Äôs Supposed to be to let the Ambos out quick... While doing a clinical placement there we played ‚Äúspot the bloke in a hurry‚Äù and changed the lights to red... I finished in third outta 5... 4th and 5th got called out on a long job. I put it down to not having enough experience or practical knowledge in my post-placement interview.

I use to think this about commercials, like somebody was just waiting for the second the cartoon cut to commercial to press a button to pick which commercial aired. I pictured a big desk control panel with a ton of buttons. When the screen would sometimes go black and the commercial was delayed a couple seconds I would think the button guy got distracted

Woah really? That‚Äôs so interesting to me, I never knew there was an actual psychology term for it. Just thought I was crazy ig üò≠  
It's really interesting and is originally a Chinese term. The revenge part is about the "996 schedule" culture. Edit: The journalist defines it as ‚Äúpeople who don‚Äôt have much control over their daytime life refuse to sleep early in order to regain some sense of freedom during late-night hours‚Äù.  
That‚Äôs understandable. I guess I never thought of it as trying to regain control, but now I do realize that‚Äôs pretty much what I‚Äôm doing

Sometimes yeah. Having worked/studied all day then immediately going to sleep, knowing you‚Äôll work/study all day tomorrow as well, is the worst of feelings.  
I hear ya, I had a summer of overlapping jobs to save up some cash before transferring to university.  I worked 9-5, slept for a few hours, went into 3rd shift 10-3, repeat.  I remember being so out of it that I got home into the driveway at 3AM and found a stupid mobile game (Bloons TD or Zombie Smasher not sure) and sat there and played it in my old ford ranger for a solid hour or two knowing that I needed to get some sleep for the morning shift.  I just needed something to do that I didn't have to do.  Glad that is over.

in my 20s, I learned that a lack of sleep made me less stable emotionally and mentally even if I didn't feel sleepy. So even if I was getting some benefit from staying up I was taking it out on everyone and everything else in my life. So I started regulating my sleep. in bed asleep by 12. up at 8. If I had a late night out id still maintain the 8 am alarm so as to not get off schedule. This was the single best change I've ever made to my life. It allowed me to be much better in every aspect. Focus at work. Be better in social situations. Be a more considerate human. id say the best thing you could do is move your free time to before your non-free time. id try to get enough time before work or school that you are bored. 2 or 3 hours of being awake with a game before you have to run off and be productive make the day go much better.  
I needed this . Thank you

yes. it is negatively affecting my marriage bc my wife goes to bed very early and feels like I am rejecting her. I tell her to stay up and do something with me, but sleep is extremely important to her.  Also, this can be a sign of depression fyi.

Every. Fucking. Night. Knowing full well that I have to workout at 530am, work from 8-6 and go to MMA/BJJ class after work for an hour and half to two hours and half.  I should really get more sleep.  I keep my exercise regime up, my diet is clean, I work hard and meet all my goals at work but for fucks sake I NEVER get enough sleep. I should really start taking it more seriously.

I felt like this until I got a second shift job. Now I stay up until I naturally feel tired and wake up without an alarm and I feel FUCKING AMAZING. It PISSES ME OFF that more jobs aren't like this.

Definitely. I lived on my own for a while now and I recently moved back into my parents house to do some house hunting. The only free time and alone time I get is at night. Needless to say I'm up very late most nights. I love my alone time.

Yes. The kids are finally in bed after getting up a billion times like every night. There haven‚Äôt been a lot of breaks this last year and I can‚Äôt help but soak up every minute that I can do whatever I want without having to break up a wrestling match, clean up a mess, or find someone food. I love my kids but mommy parents better after a break.

I talk to all my patients about this. Many of my adult patients are always tired because of this. Just have to make the choice that sleep and feeling good is more important.

Yes, especially when I'm depressed :( As soon as I go to sleep it'll just be the blink of an eye before I'll be waking up to a new day just to do crap I can hardly bring myself to do... I'd rather stay up and put it off, even though I know it'll only make the next day harder on me.  
Hey, if you ever need anyone to talk to my chat box is always open. I understand the feeling though. Try to plant different little things in each day so that you have something to look forward to, and it doesn‚Äôt all feel the same

The worst is that you do it for too long, then you have to get up and go pee right when you‚Äôre about to fall asleep. Then it starts all over again

Yeah. I work a lot of closing shifts and it's fucked my sleep schedule. They start at four, and I hate waking up and doing things before work because my anxiety is constantly telling me work is going to happen soon.  So, I stay up as long as I can, sometimes until 8 or 9 just to have some free time.  Unfortunately, this has bled into other days when I work earlier. One week I had three closing shifts, each with a 10 am shift the next day. I think I got 8 hours of sleep combined those nights

I do the opposite, I like waking up early (sometimes I don't exactly have a choice, when I'm up I'm up) and then I'll just lay in bed, listening to music with my headphones and doing whatever on my phone or getting a cup of coffee and just vibe. It's just really peaceful when there's no one around to bother you, and I'll usually have about 3 hours to myself.  
I keep telling myself I'm gonna start handling it like this. It's really nice when getting ready for work isn't the first thing I'm doing when I wake up.

I‚Äôve done this a couple of times before, and it‚Äôs definitely better than staying up late and chilling. For some reason it feels more productive. But normally when I wake up early I‚Äôm immediately on the go

Yep yep yep then sometimes go "ok that one actually kinda hurt"  
In Finland we sometimes say "hui!" when we are startled, my mom used it every time she bumped into something or someone. This became awkward when she had a Russian family staying over. "Hui" means something a bit different in Russian. She'd constantly run in to the family kids running around and unknowingly shout "Dick!" at them. She now uses "oops"...

I used to do it when we had to correct homework, because I never did it and in that way I knew which one I would have to correct and do it quickly.  
Omg, I forgot about correcting other students homework! Btw... what kind of slack, lazy shit was that on the teachers part??  PLUS, if your buddies got your paper and the answers were wrong, they just marked them as correct anyway, hahaha!   
I remember once the class was correcting each other's homework and the kid who got mine yelled out "You're wrong, Michael." after almost every question.

I had a teacher once make us say out loud what we got on our partner marked quizzes so he could write the results down. Needless to say it was traumatic

I dont consider it lazy, more like time consuming. Not very reliable, but it's only gradeschool homework, it doesn't matter much  
Partly but it‚Äôs part of the job of the teacher to look at which students are missing and figure out how they can help them improve

I was listening! And I do remember this one certain scenario because this girl misread the word tongue and it stuck with me forever. Because A) how can you be so stupid that you don't know what word that is? (We weren't very good friends at the time) and B) because it was such a bizarre way to say it that it stuck with me forever. 15 years later and I see that girl on my news feed like "wow, you couldn't pronounce tongue at one point"   
what was the pronunciation? i can‚Äôt think of a way to mispronounce it.  Town-gee Ton-gee Ton-gue (gue like hue)  
Omg it had to be Ton-gue. That‚Äôs the only one that makes some sense üòÇüòÇ

As an ELA teacher, I always give my class a few minutes to find their place first and read it to themselves. If they need help or want to switch places with another student that is fine. Then we read aloud- with everyone feeling more confident about what they are reading. The purpose is comprehension- not embarrassment- in my classroom. So many kids have major anxiety about reading aloud/ speaking in class....I feel it's my duty as a teacher to allow my students to be confident and sure of themselves. üòä  
I dealt with by anxiety about it by doing various stupid voices. Pretty sure most teachers hated me for it, but one teacher seemed to genuinely think I had a future in voice acting.

Yeah, they have anxiety for good reason. We definitely made fun of the poor readers when I was a kid. But I wonder if kids are more sensitive and understanding now.

Still do this in my Spanish class. I‚Äôm over 60.  Had to stop in primary school, though. I could read newspaper headlines at 4 years old (so my mother claimed, I don‚Äôt remember this at all) thus reading lessons were boring.  At school, We all sat on tiny wood chairs in a circle, primers On our knees. Each child would read a sentence. The teacher would correct them if there were mistakes and make them do it again. And again. And again. Literally children would cry.  I quickly grew bored and would read ahead, page into page into chapter, hoping something of interest would occur. Anything new besides ‚ÄúSee Jane run.‚Äù  So when the read-out-loud turn circled back to me I am not even on the right page any more and yelling would ensue.

Yes, and then you get a word like mischievous and agonize over how you're going to pronounce it. Should I go with "mis-chi-vus" or "mis-chee-vee-us"??What if they think I'm dumb if I say it wrong?

Actually, in teacher training we were told to pick our students at random because indeed, they would be preoccupied with which paragraph/sentence they had to read; rather than with the content of the text.   
I never thought reading out loud was very effective. I was always a fast reader,  so I'd end way ahead of everyone else, while trying to maintain some idea of how far back everyone else was and just got confused. Eventually, I just refused to read out loud. Better test and quiz scores than anyone else in class, lowest class participation grades. Participating interfered with my education I say.

DAE, when packing, take at least 2 times more underwear then you would ever need for that trip, 'just in case?'
Yeah, all year round I don't shit myself or need a second change of underwear. But the second I go on vacation the chance I'll shit myself goes up 50000000%  
That is anxiety. Once i had an accident, and from then on I always have medication on me. Stressing about it makes it more likely to happen - stress poop.  
Yes, exactly this. One time two years ago I accidentally ate something with cheese in it without taking my medication and very nearly - but didn't actually - have an accident. I resigned myself to the fact I probably would though which is an awful place to be. Now I drive everywhere instead of public transport because if I shit myself I'm by myself in my own vehicle. And I have spare clothes in the car. But still, never actually have shit myself.

Do you seriously just shit yourself suddenly out of the blue? Is this common? Like I haven‚Äôt shat myself once since I was 4  
I drink a lot on vacation, and I barely ever drink otherwise. The last time I drank I dropped my pants and not my underwear. Pooped myself while sitting on the toilet, wearing my underwear. Worst part was that it ran down my leg and into my pants.  
Dammit man! I‚Äôm sitting at the airport trying to stop cry laughing.

It is probably that people are breaking/changing eating habits when they go on vacation.  A new food doesn‚Äôt sit well and now you have digestive issues.

Absolutely yes.  Never know when you'll shit yourself.   
But the other 360 days of the year I don't shit myself, but then the second I'm on vacation I plan for shitting myself twice a day.

Hearing that people don‚Äôt do this gives me secondhand anxiety. Not trying to live life on the edge, not when it comes to clean undies.

Uhm, I do that, but not cuz I'm afraid of shitting myself...  I mean one underwear a day is generally fine. If it's a loooong vacay, I'll prob bring just a few and washbit every once in a while. If I'm going for a short amount of time, I'll bring some extra plus one per day. That's mostly cuz I get discharge sometimes, especially around when my period is suppose to start, and sometimes, when I pee, and my undies are wet from discharge, I really don't wanna put it on again. So I'll wear more than one underwear a day.

I just went away for the weekend, a Friday and Saturday night. I brought 7 underwear and 9 pairs of socks. I wasnt sure how many times I would piss and/or shit myself, or how many times I would step in random puddles without shoes on.

There‚Äôs a reason that programmers always want to throw away old code and start over: they think the old code is a mess. They are probably wrong. The reason that they think the old code is a mess is because of a cardinal, fundamental law of programming: It‚Äôs harder to read code than to write it.
I think most programmers work in a similar way: imagine a problem, then decompose the problem into its constituent parts and attack those simpler, isolated problems. The problem with a large codebase is that no one, not even the person that wrote all of it can fit the solution in their working memory. The tendency of programmers (who generally underestimate complexity) is to say: wait a minute, this problem doesn't require 10 million LOC, I could easily solve this problem in 250 lines of elegant Haskell. There are situations where the legacy codebase is completely unsalvagable, but I think more often than not it's throwing the baby out with the bath water, except the baby is an engine that, while flawed, is generating business value.  
 The problem with a large codebase is that no one, not even the person that wrote all of it can fit the solution in their working memory.  I think this is what a lot of people - even some coders - don't understand about enterprise-grade software systems. Quite literally no one knows everything about any such system - you have to take a systems approach, design for modularity, document like a graphomaniac, and expect constant rework.  
Unfortunately, a significant number of those enterprise systems weren't designed for modularity, have little to no documentation, and receive almost no rework to minimize debt.

Unfortunately, a significant number of those enterprise systems weren't designed for modularity, have little to no documentation, and receive almost no rework to minimize debt.  
The comment you replied to wasn't saying how the systems should be, it's what you have to do when you encounter such a system. No modularity? Start breaking it into submodules. No documentation? Write some (while you explore the system yourself). No time to rework? Communicate the urgency of it to the manager. That's actually what the best of the best programmers do (I'm not one but I've seen some of them in action). This is where all the hard work is, not coming up with a new solution/framework/system  every time pretending you're Linus Torwalds.

 document like a graphomaniac  Serious question, how do you document these systems? What do you document? Documentation is my hardest area, I don't know what the next dev will want to know.  
Explain the purpose of each class/method. Walk them through how your code works. Explain why you choose the implementation that you did perhaps by listing pros/cons of the alternatives. Try to break large methods into smaller well named ones. Name variables clearly, avoid excessively long expressions, avoid obscure ways of doing things(like the xor swap for example). Readability is always preferable to a few saved operations, so pick readability when faced with this choice. Try to keep code modular, it's easier to understand that way. Methods/classes should "do one thing and do it well".

Right. The sane approach to this is to identify exact parts of the problem that you don't like, and fix those, one-by-one, keeping in mind the others but writing modular code so fixing one part doesn't break the entire system or require a cascade of giant changes. You should have well-defined interfaces between parts so you can keep the same interface (or make minimal well-understood changes to it). If you don't have an interface the first step is to create one. I do this regularly on my current project, I've worked on it for 5 years now and can identify bad design choices from the past. The solution is to, when an opportunity presents itself (for example, new features or bug-fixes), take time to make changes to the architecture of that part of the code. Also when making changes you should have justification for it (future-proofing or simplifying the code is a valuable justification). That way you know it's not a vanity project because you have to actually be able to explain to people what exactly was wrong, and why.  
Yeah, this is a great attitude and is well expressed in Refactoring (Martin Fowler). I think part of what makes good programmers good is that they're not afraid to attack hard problems. A certain amount of irrational optimism or fearlessness is, at least for me, a helpful attribute. If you find yourself saying "how hard could it be" a lot, this is probably you. You just have to be self-aware enough to know that your optimism is actually a productive form of delusion sometimes.

 they're not afraid to attack hard problems.  Absolutely. I get frustrated at programmers who throw their hands up at things too fast. Recently at my (quickly-growing) company, we've been trying to divide up responsibilities for different parts of the app, but some of the leaders of other teams will say "but you guys are the most knowledgable about X". And my response is always "nobody explained X to me, I went in there and figured out how it works and that is why I'm now expert on X. Your team can do it too - I'm willing to help, but you have to put in the effort". Rant over haha

So i'm an aspiring developer.. and i dont think i classify as exactly a novice either, I've been exposed to this stuff for 20 years and always had a pretty good mind for programming. But I find my biggest road block is not being scared to tackle the hard problems, but the constant voice in my head telling me there's probably a better and more obvious way to handle this problem, and I get even to embarassed to ask for help out of fear my code looks ridiculous. Any suggestions on this?

Amazing how relevant this is to me right now. I used to work for a dev tools company. They have a massive framework collecting code over the last 20 years. And a userbase of developers who rely on that framework. About 5 years ago it was decided to deprecate the entire framework and start over. Most of the engineers were on board with this idea, but I never was. In public, I would basically stay silent, but in private they knew damn well that I thought this was a terrible idea. It lead to turmoil between me and the rest of the team. Enough that 3 of them were able to fabricate some bullshit and get me fired. The new framework was introduced. And it was missing a TON. No RegEx, no basics like hex or base64 encoding... it was a wreck. Customers never really got on board. Yesterday the company announced they were giving up on that plan and doing exactly what I originally suggested: fix the damn problems. For example, FolderItem.Item uses a 1-based parameter instead of 0-based like everything else. This is confusing and needs to be fixed. So don't throw away the entire class! Deprecate .Item and introduce .Child with a 0-based parameter. This is simple stuff, there was no reason to throw everything away. I feel vindicated. But at the end of the day, that was my favorite job and I lost it. So this also just fuels the my rage.  
I work in avionics and our cardinal rule is: If it flew, it's probably better than whatever you're going to replace it with.

I think most code, no matter how well designed before hand, is designed mostly on the fly. You always run into things you didn't think of and adapt. This leads to cludges and breaking the design. Once everything is done and it works, I love nothing better than tearing it all down and re-writing it with all lessons learned.   
I do exactly the contrary. When given a big spec, I usually feel overwhelmed on how to architecture the solution because there are so many things to think about, so I simplify the problem, temporarily ignoring some requirements or even features. When I say "ignoring", I mean literally. I start designing, then programming, a first iteration of the thing, totally incomplete, pretending it's the end product. Once I know this iteration is done and solid, I add more stuff from the spec. I study how the existing code must be refactored and changed to host the new requirements (which weren't actually new), which often involves a bit of code rework, and this way I build the next iteration. And so on. Depending on the context (deadlines, co-workers, priorities, etc), I can apply this process more or less properly, and I know that when I apply it properly I produce the best of code. The main difference I find between this technique and the "agile" process where new requirements appear out of nowhere (which I could theoretically integrate gracefully into the existing iteration following my technique), is that a finished spec has some sort of consistency whereas many actual new requirements makes no sense and come with a weird sort of inherent complexity as if it was fundamentally incompatible with the original requirements.

I find this to be the case when I teach students. For homework problems which may be encapsulated within only 100-200 lines, I actively advocate for saving a copy of their non-working code once they figure out what they need to do, and re-writing from scratch using their old code as reference and their knowledge gained. I think computer science/programming students have too much of a habit of hanging on to their old code because of the sunk-cost, but in reality it's easy to overlook some small bug in your code if you're only reading and not re-writing.  I would say that for even large code bases, as long as the constitutient parts are abstracted out, re-writing a large section isn't bad. That's the whole point of abstraction anyway. It's just getting to that point where you can easily rewrite disjoint sections of code is hard.   
Yes it's a great way to learn, but bad for business.

I think the best practice is to constantly review and refactor existing code (assuming you have the manpower to do so). That can be hard with management that doesn't understand the process or with programmers who want to always work on the latest and greatest. The long-term benefits and business value of moving from "good code" to "great code" with a little bit of love is immeasurable.

And this is where people go wrong. If you discover, once you start implementation, that your model doesn't fit, stop! Think about how you need to change your model to accommodate this new data. Refactor/rework now, before you commit to a path that you now know doesn't work. Doubling down on a bad path is, long term, considerably worse than investing in the right plan early. At least in my experience.  
Cool man, I need you to do that by Friday tho since we have a deadline, that cool?  
Also product changes the requirements and QA found a bug with another one of your PRs.

I absolutely, sincerely agree with everything you said about writing software. However, I think there's one thing that may be commonly misunderstood about Joel's original article:  Well, yes. They did. They did it by making the single worst strategic mistake that any software company can make: They decided to rewrite the code from scratch.  I've always believed that Joel's article was written in the context of a software company choosing to rewrite its core product from scratch, and this article was written in back in 2000 when "being a software company" pretty much meant "you ship regular versions of your code, and sell them to customers, and if you miss/botch a release maybe your company will die, especially if that product is your only product." Within that context, yeah, rewriting code from scratch is a very, very dangerous thing to do.  I don't think Joel is advising that no code ever be rewritten, or even that no large project should ever be rewritten. Or maybe I'm wrong! Maybe I'm giving him too much credit.  I still like many things about this article, even if the central premise is kind of a blanket statement that isn't always true, and is also kind of a strawman argument because most people don't mean "literally throw away all the old code and never look at it again" when they say "rewrite." I like this part:  Back to that two page function. Yes, I know, it‚Äôs just a simple function  to display a window, but it has grown little hairs and stuff on it and  nobody knows why. Well, I‚Äôll tell you why: those are bug fixes. One of  them fixes that bug that Nancy had when she tried to install the thing  on a computer that didn‚Äôt have Internet Explorer. Another one fixes  that bug that occurs in low memory conditions. Another one fixes that  bug that occurred when the file is on a floppy disk and the user yanks  out the disk in the middle. That LoadLibrary call is ugly but it makes the code work on old versions of Windows 95. Each of these bugs took weeks of real-world usage before they were found. The programmer might have spent a couple of days reproducing the bug in  the lab and fixing it. If it‚Äôs like a lot of bugs, the fix might be one line of code, or it might even be a couple of characters, but a lot of work and time went into those two characters.  In my experience, this is true. The "old code" generally has a lot of these little hacks and kludges to fix real-world problems. No matter how beautifully an application is (re-)architected, there are always going to be bizarre little things that just have to be dealt with, even if they junk the code up a bit.

IIRC Joel has subsequently stated explicitly that he disagrees with Mythical Man Month about this. Or, rather, he said, in his modest way of speaking, ‚ÄúMMM is wrong here.‚Äù Let's not give Joel altogether too much credit. He's smart, and he's influential for a reason, but many of the things he's blogged about lack nuance, are dogmatic, or go against what the evidence shows. And his business decisions are also quite hit and miss. The original FogBugz was written in his own VBA derivative, after all. And was subsequently rewritten from scratch in a sane language, ignoring his own written advice. So there‚Äôs that. In his defence, even those articles where he was (in my view) wrong usually contain an interesting perspective and some good arguments.

 I don't think Joel is advising that no code ever be rewritten, or even that no large project should ever be rewritten. Or maybe I'm wrong! Maybe I'm giving him too much credit.  My own takeaway from the article, and I first read it when I was struggling to convince my team to avoid a rewrite, is that rewrites are often a fallacy. They're very tempting, for a couple reasons. For one, it's easy to make quick progress on a clean sheet project, and harder on a more mature project, so it's tempting if you're looking to make quick progress, but, naturally, the rewrite will slow down again as it gets more mature. For another, and this is pretty much the title: more novice programmers haven't yet honed the skills to differentiate bad code from code that's hard to read. And that's not an easy skill. So they make a common mistake, which is to think that problems with the codebase stem from the code being bad, so they'll rewrite it with GoodCode(TM) and it'll be much better. Frankly, it's a pretty arrogant attitude. Sometimes bad code really is bad code, and then you should rewrite that code. Sometimes bad code is just hard to read, and you should add comments or refactor it to make it clearer. But ultimately, try to have confidence that you're using the right tool for the job. Refactoring bad code is pointless if it's somehow flawed, rewriting hard to read code will just introduce new bugs. I ultimately failed to convince my team to refactor instead of rewrite, and they spent about 2 years rewriting code that I estimated would have taken a few weeks to refactor. The leader of that team got fired.

Those hacks and kludges need to be documented, associated with their cause, and forwarded to the manufacturer of the issue. When the issue is addressed they need to be revisited, or if not followed up on. If you aren't tracking that... if your house was held together by string and tape, and you didn't know why, what would you do? If I know the problem, I look for a better solution. If I don't, I rebuild.

 Yeah, that's the problem with crappy code. You think that there's nothing wrong with it because it's been tested. But how do you know? Nobody apparently understands the code. Often, code is so bad that nobody knows how buggy it is. Look at OpenSSL, for a public example.  The idea that just because code is in production means it must work is a logical fallacy. Not all code in production works. Sometimes it's just not reported as a bug. Sometimes people don't realize it's a bug. Sometimes people find workarounds to accomplish what they want without reporting it. Only when none of those things are true do bugs get reported (most of the time). There's plenty of shit that has gone wrong that people don't even realize is wrong. If you don't know it's wrong, why would you report it? I worked for a project that one step of it was to edit an existing page on a web application and apply new rules to it. One of the things I decided was better off was to rewrite the whole thing, because it was shit (it was). In the process of researching how it was working to know how to rewrite it, I learned that it never worked right in the first place. It was a request approve/deny system where there was both manual and automated denials (based on different scenarios). All manual approvals and denials were counted as approvals. All of them. Only automated denials ever got treated as denials. No one ever noticed, because one team approved/denied requests, and a completely separate team handled the results of those approvals/denials, and these teams never coordinated anything. The requesters wouldn't report anything because nothing appeared wrong as the bug always worked out in their favor. So how would anyone ever notice there was a discrepancy? This page was in production in an incorrect state for over ten years. The point of this story is to prove that this entire concept that, "It's in production and no one complains, so it must be working," is plain wrong. It's very easy for people to not realize something is wrong. No one would have ever caught this bug if I hadn't done a top down analysis to rewrite it. The important part about refactoring your own code and rewriting it is to know when it's appropriate and when it's not. If a full rewrite is going to give little benefit and take a long time, don't do it. If it's the fifth or sixth time you're doing it, don't do it. If you don't know anything new that would provide benefits at the core of the rewrite, don't do it. But you also have to know what you're doing if you're rewriting it. If you're going to rewrite it by doing something completely different, then it's probably not going to be beneficial unless what you're doing has already been done elsewhere and has been successful.  
if that was in production for ten years and nobody ever had a problem the requirement itself was not needed. during rebuilding the requirement for manual approval should have been reevaluated  
The manual approval requirement scenario required a human element and the automated did not, but were two completely different scenarios that would lead to approval with different approval time windows. It was absolutely required. It was a bug that no one caught because no one did a cross analysis between what the team that was approving requests manually did and what requests were acted on as if they were approved. Everyone assumed that it worked because it was in production. That doesn't make the requirement invalid. It just furthers the idea that "In Production does not mean 100% working".

 The whole point is that the first time you make any system, you don't know what you're doing. Every decision has a non-zero element of speculation.  Yes, yes, I don't care about the technical details, I just need an estimate from you before the end of the day. ‚îª‚îÅ‚îªÔ∏µ„ÉΩ(`–î¬¥)ÔæâÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª I got dinged before from telling people something wouldn't work the way they wanted and not giving details until asked to explain... this happened enough that I started preemptively explaining the details behind the problem so they'd understand it....and then got dinged for getting too deep into the minutiae.  
"How deep you want to go?"   I ask this a lot.   You can either trust me (If I say it doesn't work like that, it's because I've tried it, probably hundreds of times and watched it fail) or sit through an explanation.   "Yes fluid is relatively incompressible.  Do you think this means it is perfectly rigid?  Do you want to see the equation for volume loss in relation to pressure?  The keyword is 'relatively', not 'incompressible'."    
And glass is clearly a liquid, that's why old church stained windows are thicker at the bottom.

 Insights from making the first system mean you can make the better decision without speculation the second time.   This is the exact reason why you should rewrite code only as a last resort, because you won't know what you need the second, third, and fourth time around either. The longer lived your 'first' codebase is the more this fact is underlined.  Worse for you, your original code will have a massive amount of secret (i.e. unspecified) functionality that was implemented as part of bug fixes, maintenance patches, module rewrites, etc. etc. etc. This functionality builds up over years or decades. A clean rewrite guarantees you will fuck things up all over again, partly because you will miss all that 'secret' functionality you didn't know was there, and partly because you will just fuck things up in new and inventive ways - because what makes you think you're any smarter than the guys in your position who wrote the initial code? And I speak with some experience. Some of my good friends are developer who were involved in a ground-up rewrite of a legacy C++ application (90s era+) in Java. And believe me, they are smart and talented developers writing really technical code. The project took 10 years (10!) and in the end, they didn't even manage to match the feature set of the original. In the meantime, the product completely stalled being in maintenance mode with no major new functionality and fell behind their competitors. The alternative, of course, was not to do a ground-up rewrite but rather update the code incrementally, module by module - with each module released and get battle-tested in production. They agreed.  This is a horror story that is repeated all the time, and developers never learn. They always think they can do it better a second time.   Yeah, that's the problem with crappy code. You think that there's nothing wrong with it because it's been tested  Because it works.  And nobody is arguing against partial rewrites of specific modules. You can do that. It's the ground-up total rewrite that is almost always a total and utter disaster.   People like clean, simple code because it's obvious that it doesn't have problems.  Great attitude to have towards utility scripts. Doesn't really apply to applications with hundreds of thousands (millions?) of lines of code, written over years (decades?), and used in production by hundreds of institutions and hundreds of thousands of users.  Trust me, your 'clean, simple code' is going to look like shit to the next guy who comes over or after a few years of bug fixes and maintenance.

 People like clean, simple code because it's obvious that it doesn't have problems.   Isn't this part of the arrogance (or perhaps, naivete) that the author is describing though?  This idea that "clean, simple code" obviously doesn't have problems because it is clean and simple. When it may very well be missing a myriad of edge cases that it didn't account for at all and the reason the past code is so messy is because it made the very same mistake and had to be added to incrementally, making it less clean and less simple over time, but also more capable of handling circumstances that no one was likely to think of at the offset. I'm sure this is not always the case, but it seems plausible that it could be the case in some situations.

 Yeah, that's the problem with crappy code. You think that there's nothing wrong with it because it's been tested. But how do you know?   For 15 years in space station 13 gas defines order of operations were wrong  
For anyone as confused as I was, apparently "Space Station 13" is the name of a role-playing game.  "Gas" is the name of something in that game, and "gas defines" are define-style pre-processor macros in that game related to gas somehow.

It depends.  I've been on many projects where the initial project requirements were "Oh, it's easy, you just need to do A->B->C->D".   Then you hit testing, or worse production, and then all kinds of wackadoo requirements materialize.  "Well yeah, Most of the time you do A->B, but in these 3 situations you go to C, then back to B, then to D for 2 of them and C for the 3rd one."  "Oh yeah, this other situation requires you to go to E, then spin a D20 and decide to go to B or C or end it in F".  <time passes with more of this going on> Oh yeah, we don't do the B->Q->M on 3rd Tuesdays anymore, now it is B->R->E on 2nd Thursdays...     Last year I finally was able to fix one of those that had been going on for 10 years because I refused to directly translate the logic between languages during an upgrade.  
This is a reality of software though; business requirements change all the time, and it WILL cause inconsistencies in the code. Its just impossible to account for anything that may change. The best you can do is design stuff to be as modular as possible (but within reason); write clean, well formatted code; and comment thoroughly.  None of that "I write self documenting code" bullshit I hear people say. No you don't. You think you do, but you don't. Write some comments.

As a programmer, I have about a 0% urge to ‚Äúthrow away‚Äù old code. However, I have a 100% urge to rewrite old code one function at a time.

While he makes some valid points, sometimes the codebase is just bad. A tangled mess of rushed spaghetti code full of "TODO" and "FIXME", and lots of temporary hacks. At that point starting from scratch can be the right decision, sometimes.    
People who are skeptical of this have probably never worked with a truly terrible code base. I think Joel is right about this in most cases, but there are always those cases that prove exception instead of the rule. I once dealt with a codebase put together in ad hoc fashion by researchers who had no idea how to code properly and it was the very definition of tightly couple spaghetti code. Every time we needed to add a new feature it took weeks or even months to do it because it took so long to figure out how to shoe-horn in the new functionality without breaking everything else. Finally, we got permission to prototype a version 2.0 that used good OOP, dependency injection, and unit testing and we modernized using RESTful services instead of SOAP. We had a working version in a few weeks(!) and fully replaced the old version within a few months while adding new features that had been on the wish list for years. This was no simple app, but a series of applications and web services and a large database.  Sometimes, you just have to acknowledge the fact that existing software is just bad and time spent fixing it is better spent on a replacement.  
 People who are skeptical of this have probably never worked with a truly terrible code base  I had a job where there were a dozen+ 30,000 line long classes. Not files, classes. There was a Globals file with ~2,400 variables in it. Every class basically stored its own copy of the system state. Previous developers would copy paste entire functions and change 1-2 lines instead of adding an "if" or parameter to add/change functionality. Every parameter (and global) was "Object" or "Arraylist" - nothing strongly typed, everything used late-binding. This was all in C#, so its not due to some cryptic language requirements. Needless to say it nearly impossible to fix a bug without breaking something else. Over time most of it was simply tossed and rewritten because rewriting large chunks of the program was easier than changing a few lines.  
Man that sounds awful. I wish there was a way to see a company's code before joining them lol

At my current job, there is a core class that does a huge chunk of processing. The main method is over 10,000 lines long and has dozens of GOTOs. In C# with no unit tests. Several attempts have been made to refactor this class and all have failed.

While he makes some valid points, sometimes the codebase is just bad. A tangled mess of rushed spaghetti code full of "TODO" and "FIXME", and lots of temporary hacks. At that point starting from scratch can be the right decision, sometimes.    
The solution to the TODO problem is to replace them all with task numbers from your bug tracking software. That way you can explain what exactly needs to be done and it actually gets added to the priority list.  
And then you have managers who count productivity and success by the number of open tickets and will try to close as much as possible of these tickets to look good

I feel that a superior option is to just delete the comments and forget about them. If they describe really important actual todos, then they're already in the tracking software.

Creating tasks definitely helps you account for the problems, but it‚Äôs not a guarantee that said tasks get prioritized. Many teams tend to be more product-oriented, and focused on delivering new functionality, so small fixes don‚Äôt get prioritized.

Yes yes and you think "Oh, I could do this way better!" Then you start writing it and you make all the same mistakes they did originally and the bug reports and feature requests start rolling in. Then before you know it, your code is a tangled mess of TODOs and FIXMEs. Back in the '90's, I worked with a company that had licensed the AT&T UNIX source. A coworker was poking around in the vi source code and found a comment from 1970 complaining that the original programmer didn't like some bit of terminal handling that was going on, and he'd made a TODO to fix it one of these days.  
Ah, nothing changes. Its almost comforting.

Or you build a prototype that ends up full of TODOs and FIXMEs, and then you build a second rewrite, piece by piece, carefully documenting and testing each part as it‚Äôs added (knowing the real requirements this time, constantly checking with the prototype), and you end up with a version where there are no bugs left, the code is clean and tested. And with more features, and it‚Äôs much more stable. I‚Äôm almost done with a 2-year process of doing this right now, going from http://github.com/sandsmark/quasseldroid over https://github.com/justjanne/QuasselDroid-ng/tree/918688abd60c72efbe351e761892b65835fe4baf finally to https://github.com/justjanne/QuasselDroid-ng At least for 20kLOC to 50kLOC, rewrites are useful and helpful. Maybe beyond the 50kLOC, 100kLOC or 1MLOC limit that changes. Also, during the rewrite you absolutely need to provide at least bug fixes for the old version.

I feel like Netscape and Borland are very different from the software most of us are working today. Netscape is a desktop application with a massive code base. I'm currently working on web services and front end apps on the order of 10k LOC. I feel like rewriting Netscape is a much bigger effort (and more likely to go wrong) than rewriting these front end apps and web services. Also, FYI this article is almost 20 years old

While he may have a point, he picked the absolute worst possible example in history to illustrate it. Netscape 4 was garbage. You couldn't even resize the window without a complete reload. Hundreds of glitches in rendering. Getting absolutely destroyed by IE in every way. They made the best decision of their lives ditching that buggy codebase and beginning what would become Firefox, a revolutionary browser at the time. I'm almost certain trying to build Firefox off Navigator 4 would've been an absolute failure and disaster.

This article has an interesting way of ageing. When I read it the when it was first written I absolutely agreed with Joel, the rewritten version of netscape was absolutely atrocious. However ten years later the decision to rewrite was completely vindicated with the success of firefox. Joels was then dead wrong. Mozilla would not have succeeded in making an IE killer tied to the very brittle code base of the original netscape browser. Today the field is even more interesting, mozilla has a very interesting rewrite project with Servo. Now I think Joels main point stands, a lot of the instinct programmers have for wanting a rewrite is because it is much harder to read code than to write. As anecdata I do see a correlation with skill and how much maintaining a programmer has done

No. Very often the old code IS shit. Reading may be harder than writing but that does not change whether the code in itself is bad. I hate rewriting but very objectively the net result of the rewrite is often MUCH, much better than the prior version. This often happens because lateron it is more clear what the code should be doing; and whether it is doing it in a good way. Sometimes a language design can also become better, and old expressions can be re-written in better ways too.  
Very often the new code is also shit. Most large projects I've seen where the dev team decides to completely rewrite from scratch, they end up making a new giant codebase which is shit for completely different reasons, and it ends up taking way longer than anyone thought. Part of this also seems to stem from the fact that the rewrite team is rarely the exact same team that started the original project because too many years have gone by, so the rewrite is effectively the first time the current team has actually built the product. My own anecdotal evidence suggests rewriting pieces over time is almost always more successful than a full rewrite in one shot. Unless of course the codebase is fairly small.

 Very often the new code is also shit.  Bingo. Typical dev arrogance is usually on the display when they think they can do a better job than their peers just a few years ago.   My own anecdotal evidence suggests rewriting pieces over time is almost always more successful than a full rewrite in one shot.  Mine too. I maintain an app I build with a team ten years ago. There are plenty of things I would do differently I started all over again, but we have hundreds of customers and thousands of users - it works. If code area inevitably starts getting flakey (and it will happen), we re-design it and rewrite it.

It's very hard to overstate just how much shit code is out there, especially when you're talking about non-tech companies that don't put a high priority on software (aka most of the world).  I'm not just talking about "I don't like this code," "this code isn't clean," or anything of the sort; I mean true steaming piles of shit.  Here's a great example.  At my last job our team inherited a 25+ year old application that was bad overall (to the point where we had to rewrite it), but one enhancement added in the late 2000s really stood out. This feature involved connecting to a serial device using the .NET SerialPort class and reading measurements sent ~20 times per second.  The data format was basically STX1  NN  00\n where STX is the actual "start of text" character (0x02), NN is 1-6 decimal digits, and the spacing is variable but the length of each line is fixed (16 characters IIRC).  In order to parse this, the original developers had come up with a 200+ LOC monstrosity that had three nested infinite loops interacting with 3-4 global variables, including a timer (???)... in addition to about 4 old commented out versions of the parsing code with the same basic layout.  I never did manage to figure out how the hell that old code worked, but my replacement amounted to about 20 LOC total.  
Reminds me of the worst piece of code I have ever seen on finding a maximum. Back in college I took a difficult operating systems course in which you are partnered with somebody for the year. My partner happened to be pretty bad at coding. One of the assignments, each of which takes about 100 hours over 2 weeks, was basically creating threading/processes, with a separate far easier segment for creating a scheduler. I told my partner I basically will do all of it, but I will pass to some function "grab next prioritized thread" for the scheduler and he just has to write the function on deciding which thread is next. He spent maybe 5 hours tops while I did the other 95% of the project, and I didn't bother reading what he had written for the code since it was working. We got the project back docked for design decisions. I was baffled and spoke with my TA about it and asked why, and he pointed to the scheduler... Each thread was given a priority, and the highest priority thread was the one to be used next in the scheduler, so he had to write a function for "find the thread with highest priority". The function he wrote... for finding a maximum... for (i = UINT_MAX; i > 0; i--) {     thread = find_thread_with_priority(i);     if (thread != false)         return thread; }  Or basically, start at maximum possible number -- does a thread exist with this priority? No? Okay, repeat with maximum minus one. No thread? repeat... Until you find a thread... I couldn't believe what I was reading

for you, but what about for the customers? Is a rewrite a success if you miss 50% of the features? And I don't mean rewriting some small 20,000 line app....I mean rewriting a 1,000,000+ line enterprise app. There is always a trade off.  
 Is a rewrite a success if you miss 50% of the features?  Depends on whether or not those features were actually being used. The hard work starts long before a single line of code is changed.

Back in 2013 I pushed my team to rewrite our codebase in RoR. Originally it was a 600k+ line PHP and JS app.  You are giving a gift of two or three years to your competitors, and believe me, that is a long time in software years.  It took us roughly 3 months to get stable.  It‚Äôs important to remember that when you start from scratch there is absolutely no reason to believe that you are going to do a better job than you did the first time.  We learned from our mistakes. I 100% stand by my decision. The increase in productivity was invaluable. The code base is now less than 30k lines. Don't haphazardly rewrite your entire codebase, but don't take this article too seriously either. Edit: I realized I wasn't counting the templates in the RoR app while the templates in the PHP app were all included in my initial count. And in an effort to be fair, a more accurate total for the RoR app actually stands at 41k lines. While going back to investigate I also found that the PHP app had a 25 line license in almost every file, amounting to roughly 86k lines of license.

I don't think it is harder to read than write.  I think people overestimate how difficult it is to read and underestimate how difficult it is to write. Not only that, but tools for refactoring are poor in general and very poor in many languages.   I want to at least be able to move variables around and have that changes trickle down to where they are used.

YouTube page load is 5x slower in Firefox and Edge than in Chrome because YouTube's Polymer redesign relies on the deprecated Shadow DOM v0 API only implemented in Chrome.
Is this an issue with Polymer in general, or just how it was used on YouTube?  
It looks like polymer has migrated to v1, based on here  V0 is scheduled for deprecation starting in April 2018 and removal in April 2019. If you are still using this consider migrating to the new API or upgrading your Polymer library.   
So YouTube is using an older version of Polymer? Huh.

Is this an issue with Polymer in general, or just how it was used on YouTube?  
Polymer back then was basically built on the bet that web components and shadow DOM were picked up as standards and implemented by all browsers eventually. That bet didn't pan out and we're left with Chrome which is effectively the blueprint for the spec, Safari where shadow DOM is broken in so many places and no one fixes it, and everyone else who waited for the dust to settle. By now no one else really wants to implement it, which left Polymer at a stage where all browsers except one would always need a polyfill (which made every DOM operation horribly slow). We've used Polymer at work for an application (currently being rewritten with a hopefully longer-lived framework) and ended up having to tell Firefox users that performance may be unacceptable.  
Is this an issue with Polymer in general, or just how it was used on YouTube?  
Polymer in general, at least in earlier versions, it's based on the v0 API mentioned here. I think newer versions behave better in other browsers since the API did get a v1 that other browsers are implementing, but it's still not great.  
Polymer 2.0 and greater uses the v1 APIs, which is released in Safari and Chrome, and will likely be in the next release of Firefox, v63. You can try it out in Firefox today with the dom.webcomponents.enabled and dom.webcomponents.shadowdom.enabled preferences. More info: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM  
YouTube page load is 5x slower in Firefox and Edge than in Chrome because YouTube's Polymer redesign relies on the deprecated Shadow DOM v0 API only implemented in Chrome.
YouTube in general needs a viable competitor. Not just someone else that does video, but an actual competitor that can bring in the content creators. I fear the only ones capable though are other already big players (Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook (is trying but it's kinda meh)) rather than new smaller ones. Basically because it's hard to make money on effectively either a "free" service and the selling the users to advertisers model.  
At this stage, the infrastructure requirements are so high I can't see anyone but Amazon actually competing. And while they've got Twitch, I'm doubtful they'll ever expand it to be a YouTube competitor since it'd ruin the current brand image that's made it successful in the first place.  
Amazon can launch a new site to compete with YouTube.  
They could try, but Amazon has tried to launch a number of competitive brands in the tech space that just haven't caught on. Personally, I don't think it'd work unless they bought an existing brand or used one they already own.

I mean there was supposedly talk of pornhub branching out.  I never took it seriously, but if you're talking about a place that cares about content creators and has the infrastructure...

Google is going through their own 'embrace, extend, extinguish' phase. Embrace open source, extend existing projects like Webkit with lots of improvements, but ensure their stuff is shit on anything non-Google. It's kinda sad how they've changed. I'm glad we can now rely on the true bastions of open source; Microsoft.

That with VS code can be a sign they are going to change progressively more and more towards open source but I will doubt anything until I actually see it. Buying github can change nothing or even make it all worse.

I don't see why you think they've "changed". They have always been like this. This is simple case of competition - when you are catching up you play good, when you are on top you try to monopolize and optimize for profits (in this case control of the ecosystem). Microsoft are only good now because they are catching up. Google are still worse than MS though because Google are extreme hypocrites and people fell for it. MS didn't act like they were some charitable organization and they even proudly proclaimed that they want an MS PC on every desk.  
Some people genuinely care about open source. Red Hat never tried locking down Linux. Mozilla never leveraged Firefox into altering the internet by fiat - they couldn't even get APNG off the ground.  Not every company has a Larry Ellison.   
I still want my APNGs damn it.

I was as angry as anybody when Google killed Reader, but I don't think that's why RSS is dying.  RSS is dying because of Twitter and Facebook. I hate it when I hear people talk about how Twitter is great for news, not realizing that they could use an RSS reader like Feedly to get all of the same information in a much saner format.  (No one says that Facebook is great for news, but apparently they use it anyway.) Honestly, I'm pleasantly surprised that RSS has lasted as long as it has.  I suspect the only reason it's still viable is because it's popular among the sort of people that build websites.

Microsoft is hardly playing catch up. Their stock prices are up something like 120% in 2 years.  
Microsoft's doing fine financially and possibly ahead in regards to cloud infrastructure. But they're playing catch up on web & open source and have pretty much given up on mobile.

In this case I don't think it's that malicious. Just look at the trash fire that is YouTube gaming. YouTube just had no idea what they are doing.  
Youtube has also worked for years to prevent people from watching in the background, instead of, uknow, disabling the video stream and letting the audio play. The removed any app on the play store that allowed background play, forced firefox to pause it, and to remove any setting allowing the opposite. Despite not making any money, it took them 20 years to offer a paid ad-skip solution, and it doesn't even allow for direct channel support. They had to wait for fucking patreon to see that there were people both willing to pay to not have their time sold to the highest bidder. They fucked themselves over trying to appease adverisers that have no idea what they want, while actually encouraging the worst kind of content targeting children. Just a fucking garbage fire.  
PornHub needs to launch a non-porn spinoff already so we can all stop using Youtube

IE6 wasn't malicious, and look at what it did to the web. Google have been pulling this shit for a while and I don't buy the "it's just incompetence" line any more. They have gone out of their way to break their own applications for Edge (G Maps) in the past. YouTube's failure to get its shit together smells more like malicious negligence with the added bonus of plausible deniability.  
They named their premium offering YouTube Red. The people that make decisions are just stupid.

Glad to see people using my project! I'd love to hear your feedback on how to make it better. I'm pretty happy with how light the site is (the homepage is ~6.5kb compressed without images), For other folks who just want to use YouTube, you can add &disable_polymer=1 to the video URL to hopefully speed up rendering. EDIT: Thank you everyone so much for your feedback! Invidious is open-source, so feel free to open an issue here. Thank you again!  
invidio is yours? The only thing I'd add is a dark theme and maybe a "sort by" for channels, other than that it seems to be pretty good.  
You can actually already enable dark mode in your preferences. I've heard that requested more though lately so I should probably move it someplace more obvious so people can find it :P

?disable_polymer=true works for getting rid of the new design on Safari, maybe other browsers too Edit: this doesn't seem to stick across tabs, but there's a cookie you can set instead which is what the addon does: https://github.com/thisdotvoid/youtube-classic-extension/blob/master/background.js#L65 I forgot this. There used to be an opt-out button that I suspiciously can't find anymore :)

Google is evolving in pretty much the same way Microsoft did back in the good old days of the 90s. The basic pitfall of overwhelming success is eventually complacency and stagnation.

Polymer has just been a disaster since day 1 anyways. Not surprised they didn't bother to test with other browsers, half the time it doesn't even work in Chrome. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u6Bfnq3aZk  
It's not like you're required to use Chrome to work at Google. There are dozens of people who use Firefox there! I had to file an issue against the internal code search tool some years ago because its browser search integration thing worked in Chrome but not Firefox. I wonder how many years it had been broken...  
I was under the impression that there was a fairly large contingent of Safari users internally. It was totally not my friend who works there and sends me Go Lang memes all day long when he should be working ...  
Why would anyone use Safari in this day and age?

I still want to kill whoever made the Material Design theme that reddit and youtube's redesigns use. Looks fucking ugly on desktop. No surprise that it performs like shit too.  
I honestly cannot believe how slow the Reddit mobile redesign is. How did they take a functional website and redesign it to now take 10-15 seconds to display text and images in a list? Is all the extra white space that computationally demanding?    
Remember how a news site made a GDPR compliant version by just removing all the tracking, which resulted in a 500kb page that worked like a champ?  
It's https://eu.usatoday.com, and it's still fucking amazing. A shining star that showing what the web could be.

It's slow because it's running a million background scripts that are tracking your mouse movements and how you navigate through the site. Reddit users always split down the middle in the camps of "Accept that change is going to happen, dont whinge" and "This fucking redesign sucks ass, how did you screw this up?" camps but boy howdy do those people who accept redesigns really chap my ass on this specific issue.

Little tip, turn off adblocking and see just how quickly the adspace is loaded and populated and rendered compared to literally everything else. Gives you a hint as to what the function behind the redesign was.  
I browse on a fairly old laptop. The pageload goes roughly like this over the space of 20 seconds: - background panels are loaded, all either white or black depending on the theme - Things start rearranging - Things stop rearranging while a massive oversized advert loads - Title loads - Thumbnail loads - Everything stops while the advert resizes - Text loads about 10 seconds later Then I scroll and nothing really happens for a couple of seconds, and finally the page jumps about 2/3 down the loaded content and the 2nd ad renders, again halting everything. Finally after 20-30 seconds I have a usable page.

It could look good. It's just poorly implemented in both cases. There's a lot of design "rules" to Material that aren't being adhered to. Those "rules", although subtle, tie it all together and ties it into mimicking the physical world. Which is easier on the eyes and sensibilities.  
 There's a lot of design "rules" to Material that aren't being adhered to.  A core principle behind material design is that you understand the 'user story'... as in, you know precisely what the user wants to do and when they want to do it.  Good thing youtube and reddit know precisely how we all want to interact with their sites and aren't trying to push us to paid promotional content.

I never understood the 'material design mimicking the physical world' part. Could someone explain how is it mimicking the physical world? It makes no sense to me.   
The basics of it is that the "layers" of a layout should interact as if they were pieces of paper on top of each other. The shadows should be consistent in they way they cast on the lower layers. Also, in the same way that you can't pass a piece of paper through another piece of paper, lower layers shouldn't just magically come to the forefront.

8 trillion dollar fine by the e.u coming up   
You are joking but the state of YouTube on Edge (which is much worse than Firefox) is in my opinion close to simply blocking a competing browser.  
You think that's egregious? They practically killed Windows Phone:  Google refused to create an official Youtube app (or an app for any other Google platform, really) for WP8. Google blocked Maps access, even though Windows 8 and WP8 both used IE.

Chrome, the IE of XXI century.  
That is a sentence that could only be said by someone who doesn't have to deal with Safari's (particularly mobile safari) absolute insanity. Chrome has quirks because they're moving too fast. Safari is insane because Apple thinks they're 1998 Microsoft and outright refuses to implement modern specs and want absolute tyrannical control over their ecosystem.  
 Safari is insane because Apple thinks they're 1998 Microsoft and outright refuses to implement modern specs  They don't want the mobile web to get too good because it will interfere with the App Store. I generally assume any severe layout or rendering issues are intentional.  
That's very ironic and sad considering what the iPhone originally launched as. Native apps weren't even planned, HTML 5 was meant to be the future of mobile applications.

How I Got Paid $0 From the Uber Security Bug Bounty
If OP can find these many security holes in uber systems, I'm sure he can go further and find more. But this time, I sincerely hope he publishes those as a zero-day vulnerability.  
He did publish them. Reposting this HN comment comment here, which sheds some light on why he was paid $0 for these bugs:  These are low severity reports. The first two require difficult prerequisites for an attacker to exploit, and the last one was not proven to be a security flaw. #293358: it's not ideal that the certificate isn't pinned, but to exploit this an attacker needs to either install their own root certificate on the victim's device, somehow obtain a private key for a certificate already installed, or have a certificate authority misissue a certificate to them for an Uber domain used by the app. #293363: an attacker still needs to acquire the victim's X-Uber-Token somehow for this to be useful. It's also somewhat mitigated by the token being invalidated when the victim changes their password. #293359: as pointed out by Uber, no weaknesses in the token generation algorithm were actually demonstrated, and brute forcing the 2128 keyspace is infeasible. Also, the rudeness he displayed was petty and unhelpful:  given the fact that at least one of your system architects were apparently high when they designed and implemented your bearer token assignment process Not completely unexpected though, given the caliber of talent utilized by Uber such as the ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù group that you hail from. You would do well in government security consulting, for sure. Oh my God. Are you seriously the Program Manager for Uber's Security Division, with a 2013 psych degree and zero relevant industry experience other than technical recruiting? LULZ  All in all, rather a poor result for this vulnerability researcher.   
Not saying it excuses his cuntyness, but at least #293363 sounds fairly viable given the frequency with which people use public wifi and the infrequency they change their passwords (I can't recall ever updating mine, at least on Uber)

Doesn't seem their guidelines requires there be another ticket. The problem doesn't have to be previously reported, simply previously known. If it came up in an internal meeting during development there's no ticket to link to.

It's also somewhat mitigated by the token being invalidated when the victim changes their password. #293359: as pointed out by Uber, no weaknesses in the token generation algorithm were actually demonstrated, and brute forcing the 2128 keyspace is infeasible. Also, the rudeness he displayed was petty and unhelpful:  given the fact that at least one of your system architects were apparently high when they designed and implemented your bearer token assignment process Not completely unexpected though, given the caliber of talent utilized by Uber such as the ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù group that you hail from. You would do well in government security consulting, for sure. Oh my God. Are you seriously the Program Manager for Uber's Security Division, with a 2013 psych degree and zero relevant industry experience other than technical recruiting? LULZ  All in all, rather a poor result for this vulnerability researcher.

If OP can find these many security holes in uber systems, I'm sure he can go further and find more. But this time, I sincerely hope he publishes those as a zero-day vulnerability.  
Uber is such a shitbag company that I wouldn't blame him if he sold them instead.  No reason to be ethical with an unethical company.

 No reason to be ethical with an unethical company  Not even to avoid fucking over their customers?  
The best way to protect their customers is to get them to stop using the malicious service. If the company can't get their act together, I see no reason for others to try and help them.

If you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas. Uber has proven to be a deeply unethical company time after time, over years.  No one should be doing business with them.  
 No reason to be ethical with an unethical company  Not even to avoid fucking over their customers?  
No one owes loyalty to Uber or their customers. They're in a business to sell services. They owe their customers a service and the security of their customer's information required for use of that service. The rest of the world owes them nothing. The fact that they have failed in their duty to protect their customers should be exposed and it will be exploited too. It's what happens when you have information that you don't protect. It doesn't matter who's information it is. If it's available it will be exploited.  Offering the bounty was literally asking for pen testing. The fact that they did it without doing it themselves first is monumentality stupid. Then saying that they knew about these issues before they were posted is rage inducing. They'll get what they deserve. Their customers I feel a little sorry for.

I don't live in the US and my choices are local corrupt lazy greedy bastard taxis, or Uber. So uber it is all day long. The instant Lyft or anyone else becomes an option though I am jumping ship. I don't know I would encourage publishing zero day options for any company like this, you are going to hurt their users more than you are going to hurt them. Even if they are complete dbags and deserve it.

How I Got Paid $0 From the Uber Security Bug Bounty
And this is how bug bounty programs die and companies get breached. I understand that you can't pay out for every tiny UI bug random people find (although I was impressed that GoDaddy paid out $50 to me once for what basically equated to a UI bug), but if someone has provided something so actionable you go and take a service offline, they've found something. The purpose of a bug bounty is to encourage ethical disclosure with the promise of payment by following the ethical route. Stop honoring that and people will start following the unethical routes to get paid for their work.  If this were me, I'd probably try to take them to small claims court. I'm not sure what BS arbitration rules this middleman website has, but I'm pretty sure in most jurisdictions you're entitled to unbiased arbitration at least. Or maybe reach out to the bounty program again? Show that you had actionable data and the company acknowledged the issue by fixing it, they should pay out at this point. I'd probably also tweet up a storm about it, companies get uptight about bad Twitter press these days, especially security stuff.  
 The purpose of a bug bounty is to encourage ethical disclosure with the promise of payment by following the ethical route. Stop honoring that and people will start following the unethical routes to get paid for their work.  You know what's weird and shitty though? If you follow the ethical route and disclose that, there's nothing stopping them from fixing it and not paying, or not paying but monitoring it, then when someone (say, the person that submitted it) decides to go about that business, you're screwed. Here's a cautionary tale here! It's so underhanded that you're basically at the mercy of them honoring their word. DEFINITELY make a scene about it. Share this far and wide. Make it the most expensive pay dodge they've ever made.  
The problem with that is that if you screw enough people, they're eventually going to screw you over the first chance they get.  Bug bounties exist to encourage programmers to "do the right thing" and  if it ever gets out that the bug bounty is a lie, there's nothing stopping people from going the black market route which isn't really what the company wants in the long term.  Unfortunately there are enough stupid people in these companies that they don't understand that there are consequences for treating people badly.

It's pretty sad when this happens. I have no clue about security (I'm just a lowly programmer) and many years ago I accidentally found a way you could play a popular MMO (Age of Conan) for free (Circumventing the monthly subscription). When reporting it I got a thanks from one of their senior GMs, that's it (And that was one of the bugs they actually fixed in a few days, instead of months, lol). Not even a free month of game time or anything, I'll never report anything again for free.  
Fine i'll ask Since they've fixed it, what was the bug?

paypal once refused to honour a payout only because the guy who reported the bug was 17 and supposedly ineligible to use paypal, even though there was nothing on their bug bounty program that said you had to be 18 source  
PayPal is sometimes such a shitshow that it's hard to remember that Elon Musk is involved.  
I mean, Elon hasn't been involved in Paypal since 2002.

I once worked for a hosting company that had an XSS vulnerability which allowed one shared hosting customer to inject and then control another customer's shared hosting account. The security team denied it was possible for months even though hundreds of customers reported it. I found the bug in my own time and reported it as confirmed. Again, they denied it as possible and berated me for reporting an issue that they already confirmed was not possible. Then, I made a step by step walkthrough of with screenshots on how I was able to gain control of another hosting account (a friend's account, with permission). In addition to sending it to the security team, I sent it to management. That's why I included screenshots and working examples along with notes on how to do it to ANY account. I also noted that you can still see my own Linux user and group IDs as the new files' owner in my friend's account which confirms the files were created via an XSS vulnerability because he can't create files with my Linux ID. That got a response. It was fixed within a weekend, but again I was berated about a week after that. This time management approached me and said that the "bug" was fixed, but IT security reassured them that my report was not possible. It was just a minor bug that couldn't possibly have affected customers. They also noted that the immediate stop of customers reporting XSS attacks was 100% coincidental. Again, because it was not possible. Also, I might be fired for hacking. Even though I did it with my friend's permission and good intentions, the company takes that stuff seriously. I wasn't fired. That was the last time i went above and beyond for that company.  
So they fixed it while it was not a bug and they wanted to fire you for hacking when it wasn't even possible? Did the security team also install Google Ultron for everyone?

Yeah, I had a friend who once experienced some strange behaviours logging into his banking account online, I inquired deeper and discovered a fucking horrible vulnerability. I emailed said bank and told them I believe I have discovered a serious issue with their login system and asked if a bug bounty was available. I got a response back 10 days later saying they would forward it to the correct department and I never heard from back from them again lol.  He has since switched banks.   
After doing a bunch of attack simulations on various large US banks, this is not surprising to me at all. I've seen some interesting attack chains that led to a complete compromise of a bank's network, and then they don't fix it because it gets lost in the bureaucracy.

Even still, $50 for a UI bug isn't exactly expensive. The average programmer is probably costing a company at least $50+/hr to employ.

How I Got Paid $0 From the Uber Security Bug Bounty
Uber is such a shitbag of a company that this doesn't surprise me at all.

Because Uber was the first company to try to solve a very real problem that exists in some cities (seriously fucked taxi regulation). While they were solving a real problem it turned out that at the end of the day their methods are even shittier than the taxi companies they're trying to replace, and they're very much in the business of fucking everyone but themselves.  
This response tells me literally nothing that they have done wrong... neither have any of the other replies?

Yeah it's 'Lulz' worthy but still a shitty thing to write to a person/company, especially when you're trying to get paid. It should be in the article, not in his bug report comments.

I agree, he is the one who started the personal attacks when he posted  Further, given the fact that at least one of your system architects were apparently high when they designed and implemented your bearer token assignment process without any ability to programmatically expire tokens, you have millions of bearer tokens floating around out there waiting to be discovered with this type of enumeration method, and with a bit more digging into your Oauth2 token assignment process I am confident that I can dump a few million of those unexpired tokens with a side project focused on modeling your PRNG output with a generative deep neural network after I capture a few hundred thousand Oauth2 tokens from your password reset process.  because he was (somewhat understandably) mad that they wouldn't pay him at least $500. I find it highly unprofessional, and I'm kind of not surprised he's an "independent security contractor" spending a lot of time on public bug bounties. Additionally, his comment about the generative net sounds like bullshit to me, as someone with a background in ML.  However, the lack of rate limiting actually is important and 100% a security flaw.   
 However, the lack of rate limiting actually is important and 100% a security flaw.  It's not. The auth token he's talking about is static per-user, changes with password resets, each user has exactly one, and are only used by first-party apps. They're not OAuth2 tokens, and he seems to know that so I don't know why he's calling them that in this article. Since we know that each user has exactly one token and it's composed of 128-bits of cryptographically random data (meaning it comes from a pool of 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 possible values,) we can figure out how many tries it would take to guess any token via exhaustive search. Assuming everyone on the planet has an Uber account: >>> print("{:,.0f}".format(((2**128)/7590515550)/2)) 22,414,970,674,879,813,525,541,224,448  Is roughly how many tries it would take on average to guess any valid token. No rate limiting necessary. Assuming you can try a single token per millisecond it would still take 71077405742262216 years to guess a valid one. There are valid technical criticisms of how Uber handles auth. Not ratelimiting when an invalid auth token is sent is not one of them.  
 However, the lack of rate limiting actually is important and 100% a security flaw.  It's not. The auth token he's talking about is static per-user, changes with password resets, each user has exactly one, and are only used by first-party apps. They're not OAuth2 tokens, and he seems to know that so I don't know why he's calling them that in this article.

I agree, he is the one who started the personal attacks when he posted  Further, given the fact that at least one of your system architects were apparently high when they designed and implemented your bearer token assignment process without any ability to programmatically expire tokens, you have millions of bearer tokens floating around out there waiting to be discovered with this type of enumeration method, and with a bit more digging into your Oauth2 token assignment process I am confident that I can dump a few million of those unexpired tokens with a side project focused on modeling your PRNG output with a generative deep neural network after I capture a few hundred thousand Oauth2 tokens from your password reset process.  because he was (somewhat understandably) mad that they wouldn't pay him at least $500. I find it highly unprofessional, and I'm kind of not surprised he's an "independent security contractor" spending a lot of time on public bug bounties. Additionally, his comment about the generative net sounds like bullshit to me, as someone with a background in ML.  However, the lack of rate limiting actually is important and 100% a security flaw.   
I guess I see this as he is not a contractor or an employee of the company, he is purely being used for his skills, and if every second word is "fuck" it shouldn't really impact his ability to get paid on a bug bounties program. His role is not really to be professional, he is choosing to report these issues to uber instead of selling them to someone else.  
I'm not defending Uber here, and this isn't really excuse to not pay someone, but the author is also not saying the full story. While he seems professional in his post, if you look at the actual reports, he sounds like a total asshole to complete strangers... Who says "LULZ" on a bug bounty report?  
He sounds like a righteous asshole though. While the personal attack is uncalled for, it's not incorrect. What is that person doing in that capacity? Aside from that, it seems in Ubers best interest to make public the worst of these tickets, so I assume this is the worst we are going to see.

Assuming there isn't editing of the facts & details, this is incredibly stupid on Uber's part.   Normally it'd just be "stupid" for any other company - But this is a company who's just been in the news for being successfully blackmailed into paying $100k to prevent a massive data breach from going into the wild. Uber is the exact kind of company who should know what bug bounties are for - Rewarding & encouraging those who find critical vulnerabilities because it'd potentially cost them much more if successfully leveraged by a malicious party.  With this coverage, who in their right mind would find future holes in Uber's services and go "Y'know, I should give this to them rather than the blackhats offering premium"?

I have this far fetched dream of WebAssembly getting bindings for most platforms and becoming the next platform that works anywhere. We could use it to write web servers, android apps, and browser code. As a low level bytecode, it'd be the target of various languages, which would make those languages inherently cross platform. I just think it'd be cool to see WebAssembly as a first class citizen for app development, as well as browser and server development. I think it's going to need its implementation of shared memory threading before any of that can happen, though.  
I definitely think its one of the main waves of the future. Pick your language, build for webasm, and move on with our lives. Run the same code almost anywhere.

Yeah, there will always be someone trying to screw things up. Today it was Oracle, tomorrow who knows.

So the next attack on openness will have to be something else, they can't use this nonsense a second time.

Or they can appeal it, which Oracle says they will do in the article above. So far in Oracle v. Google cases, if memory serves, the court has found:  In favor of Oracle Overturned the original ruling and found in favor of Google Overturned that ruling and found that Oracle's claim to copyright APIs was valid Found in favor of Google that even though the API is copyrighted, it can be used for Android under fair use.  It's basically the legal equivalent of a tennis match as far as I can tell. It will be up to the appeals court to determine whether Oracle's appeal goes to trial again, and their lawyers are quite good. But for the time being at least, the outlook is good for the future of IT.

Actually Sun started the Ask! Toolbar bundling. Sun desiring money (since they were losing lots of it) likely agreed to a very long contract which likely expired in July of 2015 (which is when the toolbar was removed from the installer). When Oracle bought Sun, it is not like they can just say no to the business contract Sun and Ask! agreed upon.

Or copyrighting the use of onions in food.   
Can someone explain this to non-programmer me?  
most programming languages have common functions that programmers can use, things that would be tedious to write and rewrite for every program they make, this is an api.  Most programmers use the ones bundled with the language without giving it much thought, as they should. This is because the api that comes with a language is often regarded as part of the language itself, sorta like living in a home without any furniture, a language without a decent api is almost unusable.  Oracle tried to claim it under copyright for Java if I'm reading the article correctly  
You're pretty close.  Google never used Oracle's library.  They developed their own limited subset of the Java library for compatibility.  All that Google used was the layout of the API. So both libraries had something like String foo(int bar) that did the same things however the inner workings were developed separately. Google didn't really take anything from Oracle.  It's kinda like suing someone over the names of a book's chapters.

This is only a moderate victory for common sense. It shouldn't have got this far, as the API itself shouldn't have been copyrightable in the first place.  
If it were up to the Judge, it wouldn't have. Judge Alsup did a commendable job in presiding over this case, going so far as to learning to program in Java, familiarizing himself with contemporary software development practices, and how APIs are built, shared and used to ground himself in the principles he needed to grasp to properly interpret the law. In his original decision, after learning to code and what APIs are all about, he came to the decision that Oracle's copyright was invalid in the first place. That decision was later overturned on appeal, but nonetheless he has shown tremendous motivation to fully understand the questions brought to his courtroom.  
Wow, now there is a guy that I can respect.  That goes well beyond what he is required to do.  If more judges and politicians had that mindset the world would be a better place.  
Maybe, it could also be a worse place overall despite better court rulings because of a huge drop in case turnover rates due to all the extra effort everyone's putting in. Hard to tell

Kind of shines a spotlight on how arbitrary our justice system is.  It depends heavily on judges and juries being well-informed and having common sense.  A single judge gets this decision right,  but apparently a panel of appeal judges fuck it up.

It must be so embarrassing to be a developer at Oracle, knowing this is bullshit, and they just keep dragging it out. Sitting there just trying to hide the shame, unable to do anything, wanting it to stop.  
When Gemalto sued Google because they have a patent for running high level code in a mobile device, I quit my Job. Also, when a recruiter offers me a Job working for Oracle, I tell them, sorry, but I do not want to work for that company.  I think people care about this things.  
I guess everyone has their price but I cannot imagine ever working for Oracle. They seem to have a compulsion to fuck up everything they touch, especially when it comes to open source projects. Plus the whole company just exudes an air of scumminess that's really extraordinary even for American corporations.

It's amusing to think about but I don't think the average developer inside Oracle cares very much. If anything he just has to play along (like in all office jobs) and lament about how unfair the verdict was to Oracle.  
There was a NPR/Planet Money/This American Life investigation a few years ago into tech patents and patent trolls. They talked to a few software engineers in Silicon Valley who had patented their work, and some even said that they didn't know what their patent said. It's tech jargon filtered through legal jargon, and it comes out as nonsense. But I don't think they did any sort of survey of the feelings of the whole community. They probably just talked to the ones that were most willing to talk.

What scares me the most is how easily it could have gone the other way. This verdict was found by a jury with lacking computer and comp.sci-skills to put it mildly. Oracle kicked out all the computer people in the jury in the preselection. Which makes me wonder.. did the jury reach their conclusion rightfully based on knowledge about the software development field and the merit of the arguments, or from a more shallow point of view as in which company they like the most? A broken clock is right twice a day as the saying goes.

Bingo. This is why expert testimony is used.  You wouldn't necessarily dismiss a jury's ability to decide on a murder case because they aren't knowledgable in forensic sciences.  Instead, you bring in experts to explain it to them in layman's terms.  
 You wouldn't necessarily dismiss a jury's ability to decide on a murder case because they aren't knowledgable in forensic sciences.  True, yet I still think the implications of murder is much easier to grasp for non-experts than copyright lawsuits. People don't generally need to learn how murder hurts people or society, because it is obvious. But copyright infridgment and attacks on the freedom of information can also hurt individuals and society; it's just more abstract.

So everyone, let's recap. Where it says this in a source file or header file, you get a lawsuit for using it: * Copyright (c) 2002, 2010, Oracle and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.  However where it says this, and you have a shitload of money, you stand a good chance of winning the third time. * This code is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it * under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 only, as * published by the Free Software Foundation.   
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought Google didn't actually copied Oracle's actual source code.  But what they did is use function and class names that used the same names as Java's in order to allow developers to write software that follows the same standard so that it's compatible.  But all of the actual implementation of those functions was done from scratch by Google.  No?  
Yes, google did like 99% their own implementations, and the very little bit they did steal, the judge (in the first case) said that the code was trivial enough that there was really no other way to write the code and it wasn't infringement. However, the APIs themselves, while being an abstract arrangement, have to be written down in the first place. If I read a book, and then try to write my own version of that book only from memory, have I engaged in plagiarism? What if all the chapter names are the same? What if I hire a guy, who's never read the book, and only tell him the chapter names? These are very grey areas in copyright law.  
In my mind, the analogy is more like a math textbook. There can be 10 different calculus textbooks, they all implement the derivative (in this analogy a function from the API) with no issues, but it is on the author to provide their methodology and reasoning (the function implementation)

Can someone explain the technicalities of the situation?  So Google took Java and reimplemented it.  Then Oracle who bought out Sun and thus owns its Java implementation thinks it has a copyright on Java and thus Google illegally used it?  By API are they talking about the language itself? Edit: ELI5  
Google created a clean-room implementation of Java, so they did not reuse code from Oracle/Sun. However, in order for Google's implementation to be compatible with Oracle's implementation, Google had to copy many of the APIs that are part of Java's standard library.  Think HashMap, ArrayList, ThreadPool, and stuff like that. This code just says that, for example, there is a collection called Stack and it has methods push, pop, and peek; it does not say how the push, pop, and peek methods actually work. Oracle sued, claiming Google required a license for the APIs because they were copyrighted. A federal appeals court has agreed with Oracle that APIs are copyrightable. Thankfully, today, the jury decided that copying an API is fair use, which makes sense because it is the only way to create a compatible implementation.

This is the best tl;dr I could make, original reduced by 71%. (I'm a bot)   SAN FRANCISCO-Following a two-week trial, a jury has found that Google's Android operating system does not infringe Oracle-owned copyrights because its re-implementation of 37 Java APIs is protected by "Fair use." During the trial, Oracle argued that Google copied 11,500 lines of code, including parts of Java API packages as well as related declaring code, in order to take a "Shortcut at Oracle's expense." As Android prospered, Oracle's Java licensing business, centered largely around feature-phones, cratered. Oracle CEO Larry Ellison welcomed Android at first, but later he "Changed his mind, after he had tried to use Java to build his own smartphone and failed to do it," Google attorney Robert Van Nest told the jury.

Google wins trial against Oracle as jury finds Android is ‚Äúfair use‚Äù
Seriously, ‚Äúfair use‚Äù? So no verdict about copyrightability of APIs, maybe even the opposite. Meh, I‚Äôll take it.  In 2012, following a first jury trial, US District Judge William Alsup ruled that APIs can't be copyrighted at all, but Alsup's opinion was overturned on appeal. At this month's trial, Google's only available argument was that the 37 APIs constituted "fair use."   
APIs are copyrightable according to the successful appeal by Oracle...that's already established  
Sort of, in a way that's only binding if you have an ancillary patent question in any phase of your trial.

If you edit someone elses dweet, you can post it directly from their post; this tags it as a "remix" and is preferred over just copy-pasting into "New Dweet" as it preserves the link to the original. dwitter.net/random is a good way to see dweets of variable complexity and dwitter.net/new is where all the fresh redditor dweets have started to pop up :D   And it's a ton of fun to see all the excitement :) Might have to get back to working on it.

 Is this not cheating or are these defined by some dwitter library for instance?  Yea, it's the rules of the game. I was severely confused how all of this is possible in so few chars of code but you get a base library and starting point to work with.

What was your reaction when you saw the spike in traffic?  
My first reaction was "huh, is digitalocean doing some maintanance? Why did I get an email saying the site went down for two minutes?"  And then some friends pinged me about tweets and reddit. Setting up new relic now and hopefully I'll get an email earlier next time :P  Source at github.com/lionleaf/dwitter btw :) Pull requests welcome :D

Cool site! Is there a license agreement for the snippets? I'd love to use some of them as loading icons on my site (with attribution).  
That is a really good question! Definitely need to add an explicit license, and it's currently a discussion on it. If you have a specific dweet your interested in, ping me with their username and I can see I can put you in touch. If you get approval it would obviously be ok no matter the license :)  
Second related question.  If I wanted to use these on my site what librar(y/ies) would I need to include to get the effects?

Doesn't appear to be any sort of license on the individual posts, or EULA on the registration that would imply one, so everything's copyrighted to the original author of each post.

Hey guys! Creator here. Thanks for the big cuddly hug of death! Quick update: We've added some extra caching in various parts of the system and thrown some more hardware at the servers (yey for cloud technology!). It seems to be back up, but it should've scaled a lot better so I'm not confident it stays up quite yet. Investigation ongoing :) Edit: This is a small side project that was living on the smallest digitalocean droplet ^ Edit 2: Went down again even with the bigger droplet for a bit, but added more caching and it seems to be up again!

Can anyone explain how you start making something like these?  
You start with verbose and readable code and then you start stripping it down and fitting it into 140 chars. Also, you have to understand maths, mod operation and then you just have to get creative.   
I recommend looking into codegolf (e.g. codegolf.stackexchange.com), here is a nice challenge of this site that did exactly that (unfortunately closed now): https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/35569/tweetable-mathematical-art

Yeah the stripping down part is a little bit of a downside IMO, but I don't know a better way to enforce "small" Kind of would rather read a few clear lines   
Can anyone explain how you start making something like these?  
Simple example: function u(t) {         /* Will be called 60 times per second.          * t: Elapsed time in seconds.          * S: Shorthand for Math.sin.          * C: Shorthand for Math.cos.          * T: Shorthand for Math.tan.          * R: Function that generates rgba-strings, usage ex.: R(255, 255, 255, 0.5)          * c: A canvas.          * x: A 2D context for that canvas. */      c.width=2e3;x.fillRect(150,150*S(t)+150,150,150) }

So i take it there's a significant library you're allowed to assume?  
Why? The site is down now but I think most in there weee done with the above shortcuts and other core operations

 x.fillRect(150,150*S(t)+150,150,150)  How do you know what the standard functions there are for JavaScript? Like fillRect seems like such a specific function, is there an entire library of functions that we could use? And I want to do something similar in Python. Is there any recommended canvas and drawing libraries of python just like seemingly in JavaScript?

That's some magic they've got over there. Nice.  
Yup. Although it occurred to me that if 140 "characters" includes Unicode, you could probably do some amazing stuff with multi-byte characters.  
That's actually why Twitter is raising the tweet length limit - some languages can put a lot more meaning into 140 characters. Oddly, that still being true at 280 doesn't seem to have sunk in yet.  
It's crazy how much information you can put in 140 characters in Japanese. One character for a specific word, few more for grammar, no commas or spaces required (though often used), each tweet can fit a paragraph in English.

Anyone here remember portal.hell.com?  (may have been portal.hell.net) It was essentially a collection of really cool and innovative website designs back in the late 90's.  It was a major source of inspiration while I was in high school and people were making Geocities websites to share with their friends. At the time, I was pretty adept at qBasic at the time and I learned SO much about web design from reverse engineering the code on some of those websites.  
I don't remember that, but I remember a website called... Dr. Ozone's something or other, maybe? A lot of nifty javascript trickery.

Is there anyway I can make sense of the 140 character code that is written? How can experiment, test and run these codes myself?

I wish I had the motivation to learn code, it's so cool and seems like modern magic.   
To get interesting visuals you need to have good math knowledge (or steal from internet, still need to know what to search and have imagination on how to compose them). The code itself isnt much more than a formula and a few javascript canvas api calls.

Eye tracking software for sufferers of ALS/MND can cost tens of thousands of dollars, so I've spent 3.5 years of my spare time writing a free & open-source alternative - meet OptiKey (C#, Rx, WPF) (x-post from r/Software)
You are a good person. Inspiring shit.  
This is straight up Robin Hood, OP is a baller.   
I don't see the analogy with Robin Hood.  
They are overcharging the software because people with ALS are desperate enough to pay for it. This guy is taking the software and making it free for anyone.

This should definitely be marketed hard towards health institutions. Someone with the right contacts could spread this like wildfire, especially in 3rd world countries where existing solutions don't have such a big foothold. EDIT: Have you thought about integrating it with web-cam only options like http://xlabsgaze.com/ ? (I just googled eye tracking with webcam, I have no affiliation to xlabsgaze)  
Health institutions outside of the US.  Any "Medical Device" in the US requires FCC FDA certification, which is a huge pain in the ass and can cost thousands of dollars.  
Does that apply to computer software, though?  There's no possibility of harm to the patient from badly-written software, as there is with most physical medical devices. EDIT: I mean software meant to run on a PC which is not controlling any kind of physical medical device.  Obviously embedded firmware in pacemakers and such should have some serious certification requirements.  
Yes, it probably does.  There are different "classes" of medical devices that software falls into.  It's less paperwork for certain classes, but still needs to be cleared depending on what it claims to do.  (The FDA regulations are really behind the times on this issue.) Getting a CE mark for the EU or other international market certifications are usually less work than FDA filings, if you want to go that route. Also u/YeahIWroteOptiKey should think about patenting this.  IANAL and I HATE software patents with a passion, but it's worth defending yourself if business goes well.

My cousin is suffering from ALS, but I doubt he will be able to get access to expensive tech like that. How can he get something like OptiKey?  
https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/wiki/Get-Started Seems like he needs $100 - 150 for a tracker and a fairly reasonably spec'd computer with USB3  
^ exactly. I am available to help if you have any questions; optikeyfeedback@gmail.com

Is there any way this could run on non-Windows operating systems using mono or something like that?  
Doubt it. WPF is the hard stuff. If it was WinForms it may run.  
It would be a great project to port, I think. Maybe if I can muster the motivation over the next few months, I'll give it a bash.  
Do it - I would be keen to help you port this. It's on my todo list, but I've got a new(ish) baby and full time job!

It is very big project. The Mono team outright refused to do it back in the day and they had ported Silverlight. It was too big of a project to port WPF after having the code for Silverlight - that's how big WPF is.

So... from a purely lazy point of view, would it be possible to control my HTPC with this? Eliminating the crappy bluetooth keyboard/controller?  
Embarrassingly relevant to my interests as well.   
Haha. If your HTPC is Windows based then yes in theory, but from a practical point of view you probably wouldn't want to. You need to be positioned correctly in front of a tracker, which needs to be user the screen. It wouldn't pan out.  
I wonder if there is a market for mounting a tracker to a small telescope and having it find the appropriate face then tracking it with a gimbal. Precision gimbals being run by something like a raspberry pi using OpenCV for face tracking is  within the state of the art for hobbyist electronics.

Did you do a patent search and make sure your code is in the clear? If they are charging a lot for the commercial code, they are probably taking some steps to protect their position.  
As a career programmer I feel like code patents are a load of crap. I despise them.  
Agreed. We should move to NZ. I think they scrapped them.  
Or europe. There are very few software patents here  
Agreed. We should move to NZ. I think they scrapped them.  
Did you do a patent search and make sure your code is in the clear? If they are charging a lot for the commercial code, they are probably taking some steps to protect their position.  
Question: does making it free and open-source affect patent enforcement issues at all?    
If he wrote the software using things patented by the company that produces the proprietary stuff, then they could sue or have it taken down. However you could potentially argue that the patent was obvious or something if you figured it out yourself, but that takes a lot of money and lawyers. If he wrote the software in a different method, then there's no patent on what he's done.   
I'm not sure I should comment as my reply could be used against me, but so far, so good. I wrote everything myself, from scratch, with zero reference to existing solutions. My investigation into proprietary solutions began and ended at "huh, that's too expensive. i'll make my own". Hi lawyers!

Question: does making it free and open-source affect patent enforcement issues at all?    
He can't sell it but if it is free and open source they have no one to sue. Think of it this way - he is releasing it for European users and he can't stop US users from using it as it is free and open source.  
Did you do a patent search and make sure your code is in the clear? If they are charging a lot for the commercial code, they are probably taking some steps to protect their position.  
If OP doesn't intend to sell or patent his work himself, does he have anything to gain from a patent search?  Or might it just turn any present unwitting infringement into knowing and "direct" infringement?  Might be worth briefly consulting a lawyer before initiating a search? OP is apparently English so this would be a matter of UK patent law?  If the use of a registered patent does result in the breach of a registrant's rights and then subsequently a claim, the defendant may be able to avoid paying damages or an account of its profits if it can prove that it unwittingly infringed the patent, and that it had no reasonable grounds for supposing that the patent existed.    it had no reasonable grounds for supposing that the patent existed.   ...I hope you didn't just cause OP a mess of trouble :(

Barely anyone knew what ALS was before people started throwing ice on their head and raising millions for ALS charities. Hardly 'wasting time'.

Would be great if this was ported to Linux! I can imagine that alone would open up the ability for developing specific hardware, especially if on ARM.

I wonder if the reason most similar software costs upwards of $10K is if they've got to get licensed by the FDA. I've deployed medical software that was licensed/certified by the FDA, but it was more directly related to treatment.

Respect. This is awesome. It really moved me. Do you have this copyrighted and a license on it? If not get on this immediately!!!!! (Did you see how many exclamation marks I put there?!) Seriously. I have a wall of copyrights I did for my FOSS software products. My ex is an attorney, and between her and my business, I know a few things. Its not hard, ugooglize it, or call creative commons or the eff ASAP. I am happy to answer any questions and help point you in directions. For shits and giggles someone send this to Jono Bacon. Edit: I did not clarify. Copyright is first come, first serve. Who ever gets there first gets the copyright. There are horror stories of people who didn't protect their software and had it stolen. And you are taking on some ruthless mutha suckas. Ya' best protect ya' [software]!  
It's licensed under GPLv3.

You should be sure to test this with a common mobile windows environment like a Surface Pro that could be mounted to someone's wheel chair for speech when out and about. I think it's great that you've done this. I was looking on the contribute page, and there's nothing I could do there, but I think you should have a donate button or something. I'm not even an ALS sufferer, but I'd like to donate some money, even if it was just to be put back into testing with other hardware and such. Again, what a great thing to do.  
Thank you. A surface pro should work well, but might be a little too small (and expensive) to be used full time for someone with MND/ALS. I'm not collecting personally, but enough people have asked that I set up this; https://www.justgiving.com/Julius-Sweetland (I know it's for Cancer Research - my wife's dad died of cancer and it was the anniversary yesterday - it might make her happy to see some internet love going his way)

I agree. Same goes for the Binary Search one, which is propably one of the easiest algorithms to explain in words but is barely comprehensible in the image. I say that as someone, who generally has no trouble understanding IKEA manuals The quick sort one works really well on the other hand IMHO  
The Binary Search illustration straight up made me think "This isn't that useful of a means of teaching algorithms".

It does specify to perform the algorithm again on each side of the divider.  So the recursion is there.

Same with merge sort. Not as intuitive as binary search but nearly incomprehensible in the picture.

I think the public key crypto one is actually more confusing than just reading the Wikipedia article.  
I don't think it's actually meant to explain the concept to someone completely new to it without any additional text whatsoever. The website even mentions that "they were originally created for S√°ndor's algorithms and datastructures lecture at TU Braunschweig". Having said that, I think the public key one becomes clear if you "read" the images carefully, the way you might want to read a visual novel:  There's a safe that's only open in the "up" position. It has two keys, one of which can only turn left (public), the other only right (private). Bob sends copies of the turn-left key to the world. A friend wants to send a secret love letter to bob. He puts in into the safe and locks the door with the turn-left key. Only Bob has the turn-right key to open the safe and read the letter. Bob wants to sign a letter. He puts it into the safe and locks it with his turn-right key. Everyone can check that it was Bob who has locked the safe, because their turn-left keys unlock the safe. A pirate tries to forge a message from Bob. He doesn't have Bob's turn-right key, so he puts it into a different safe and locks it with his own turn-right key. But then the other people know that this message isn't from Bob, because their turn-left keys don't open the safe.   
Agreed. I understand Public Key Cryptography so the "key" for me to understand how it's explained in the image was that there's a clockwise key and a counter-clockwise key.

 "they were originally created for S√°ndor's algorithms and datastructures lecture at TU Braunschweig"  That's cool, I took that lecture a few years ago. At the time he didn't have these images yet, but it's totally something he would use. He also had a bunch of XKCD comics in his slides, whenever he found one relevant to the topic. Great guy.

I always found it easiest to explain saying that the public key is a box of open padlocks out on the porch that anybody can take; and the private key is the single key that can open those padlocks once they've been locked. So anybody can put something important in a box and lock with one of the padlocks. From then on, nobody except the owner of the private key can open the box again, so it's safe to send to the recipient in the mail.  
Now use the analogy to explain signing something with your private key ;-)

Absolutely!   So the fundamental problem that we‚Äôre trying to solve is this; How can Alice and Bob talk to each other privately, over a medium where everyone else can hear what is being said and when they have never established secret keys beforehand. A common scenario might be when you are in a crowded room and want to get something private to your friend across the room without others understanding what you said. Turns out there is a very neat way to solve this that‚Äôs called Diffie-Hellmann key exchange.  Everyone knows two numbers g and p. P is a very large prime number (~800 decimal digits) and g is a number smaller than P but with some special properties in relation to P.  Before the exchange begins, Alice picks some random x such that 0 < x < P and Bob picks some random y such that 0 < y < P Now the actual exchange:  Alice  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîg^x ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî> Bob  Alice  <‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîg^y‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  Bob  Now Alice has gy and x. So she computes (gy )x Bob has gx and y. So he computes (gx )y  So the both get:    (g^y)^x = g^xy = g^yx = (g^x)^y  Now both have a shared secret: gxy ! And the eavesdropper Eve only heard g, gx, gy (and she knows P).  If the numbers g, p, x and y are defined correctly, Then Eve won‚Äôt be able to compute log_g gx = x. This is called the discrete log.  All of the aforementioned operations are in the group Z_p* , which just means that after each operation we apply the function mod P to the result. This is what makes the function extremely inefficient to reverse: the issue is that taking the discrete log hard in Z_p.  So an eavesdropper hasn‚Äôt been able to figure out anything, since Alice and bob agreed on a secret code. They can use this code as the key to other normal encryption algorithms to send messages to each other with end to end encryption: meaning nobody can read any messages.

Merge sort:  Split values Order the values on each side Do some magic Everything is sorted yay!    
Would you order each side using Quick Sort or do a bunch of Merge Sorts until each group of values has 2 values?  
Keep merge sorting until you have two values in each group. It's a recursive algorithm.  
Merge sort can be implemented iteratively  
Merge sort can be implemented iteratively  
Would you order each side using Quick Sort or do a bunch of Merge Sorts until each group of values has 2 values?  
Merge sort splits all the data into essentially groups of two, then orders them by building the groups together. So if you had 7 2 9 4, it would split it into (7) (2) (9) (4), then put the first two together in order, then the next two. So (2 7) (4 9). Then it puts these two together adding a single element from the beginning of whichever dataset has a lower first value. If sorting least to greatest, you'd add 2, then 4, then 7, then 9. And then you'd end with (2 4 7 9) Edit: for a little bit more info, this sort is a decently "fast" sort because the data is only really checked once. Mergesorts runtime is said to be O(n log(n) ), which essentially means that the algorithm runs in a time that is dependent on n, which is the size of the input. If you were to graph input size on an x axis, and runtime on the y axis, and then run a mergesort many times on varying dataset sizes, your runtime graph would look approximately like the graph y=x*log(x).

Actually, in enterprise business, you attach to many classes, for when your chair needs to become a table, but turns out it isn't that good at being a table in the end.  
Day 1: Business tells us they need a chair. Day 5: We've figured out what kind of chair we think they want. We show it to the business and they say it's great. Day 6: We begin development on the chair. Day 14: We're 2/3 of the way done with the chair, and the business has asked if we could make it a recliner, with electric reclining. We push back and settle on making a manual recliner. 90% of the code we've written so far gets deleted. Day 32: We've just demoed the recliner to the business. They think it's a great recliner, but they want to pilot it to a small group of users first. Day 36: The business has decided that they want to go in a different direction, and they need a table instead. And that is Agile development. /s

Hey, one of my professors who workedgir IBM mentioned something I found kind of interesting. He said if you can do class design well you will be much more highly sought than if you have great low-level coding skills.  He told us this great story about how his team would work ona challenging project, and for a week or two there was a board to stick post it notes for hypothetical classes for the project, and at the end of the week they collectedall the ideas and began the design stage, thought that was pretty cool. Anyways, I was just going to see what you thought about that anecdote, I am trying to use the CRC card method when I begin my projects, and it honestly makes class design much simpler for myself., was interested inhow much the industry really does value that ability.

How I cut GTA Online loading times by 70%
this implementation, if it works, translates to money for GTA:O. I was so offput by online load times (and getting randomly kicked all the time) on my computer that I lost interest and played Watchdogs online instead  
this implementation, if it works, translates to money for GTA:O. I was so offput by online load times (and getting randomly kicked all the time) on my computer that I lost interest and played Watchdogs online instead  
I loved the game. Stopped playing because of the long load time and the heist/lobby system.  My typical experience is: load game, alt tab and do something else while it loads over 5 minutes (m.2 EVO drive 9700k, $4K PC tower btw) 1 The get into free play.  2 Look for PUG heists.  3 Accept one.  4 Go into loading screen for heist 5 Heist is full! (Why did you boot me from my free play then R*) 6 Load BACK into free play for 2 minutes 7 Repeat steps 1-6 until I win the lobby lottery and actually get a place. This can take 30 minutes and is too disruptive to actually enjoy free play.  8 hope the host isn‚Äôt AFK 9 hope you don‚Äôt get arbitrarily kicked 10 actually play the mission maybe  11 fail once, someone leaves, back to free play. 12 repeat steps 1-12 I realised once I‚Äôd been playing for 6 hours with the goal of playing a heist and hadn‚Äôt actually finished a single mission despite doing nothing but queue all day. That‚Äôs when I stopped playing.  All these issues could be resolved with some common sense updates to their NetCode so you only get pulled into a session when there‚Äôs space. And perhaps you can backfill heist roles so one persons dc doesn‚Äôt ruin 3 peoples day.  But this article proves R* truly doesn‚Äôt care about the user experience. Hell if they made the game easier to play people might not resort to micro transactions. I‚Äôd like to attribute it to incompetence over malice but either way they don‚Äôt deserve my time or my money. Which is heartbreaking as I love the series and it‚Äôs been ruined for no reason.  
How I cut GTA Online loading times by 70%
This article was really insightful! I've always wondered what was going on in the code while waiting eons for GTAO to load. This is super embarrassing for Rockstar. This has been a well-known issue since GTAO was released, and it turns out to be something so simple.   I wonder how many millions of dollars Rockstar has missed out on from users being frustrated with long load times and closing the game. Meanwhile, some random guy with no access to the source code was able to solve this problem with about 100 lines of code  
You raise a good point on how much money they may have missed out on. I loved GTAO when it first launched; played all of the time, but the load times became cumbersome, especially when I lead a somewhat busy life. I used to buy those shark cards etc when I used to play. I stopped playing entirely and have not played for a long time now.  
Loading and matchmaking was 100% why me and my friends all stopped playing.

Reminds me of that time modders started inlining setters/getters by hand in compiled, closed-source code, getting like a 30% boost in framerate at the time, all because Bethesda forgot to turn on optimizations when compiling Skyrim.  
I personally believe it's not because they forgot. I reckon it was because their development practices were so flawed that turning on optimization introduced even more showstopper bugs. I bet they had a ton of undefined behaviour time bombs hiding all throughout their code base.

Reminds me of that time modders started inlining setters/getters by hand in compiled, closed-source code, getting like a 30% boost in framerate at the time, all because Bethesda forgot to turn on optimizations when compiling Skyrim.  
I low key hate how Bethesda is allowed to release buggy as shit games and people go "oh its just Bethesda" That half-ass it mentality is probably a key factor in why we get so many not quite finished games now. Why do the final 5% of work that's the most difficult when you can just get the community to do it for you for free

within 24 hours of release they made over 800 million dollars, its been years since then. They've made billions in people buying it on second platforms and online transactions.

It just shows how little they care.  
As a long as it meets the acceptance critieria... It's weird we expect more passion out of underpaid game developers than some guy working on some pointless tool like 1000 people use once in a blue moon (like me).  
It just shows how little they care.  
It's not that they don't care. Let me explain how it works inside a company. A company has a goal, and every action must build towards that goal, and that goal alone. You work at a non-profit to help the homeless. Well good luck trying to justify an electronic payroll system that isn't from the 70s. You have to prove that it would reduce costs and is the only way the company can grow (with the limitation that donations and government aid have) to serve more homeless. You can't? Well tough titties it ain't happening this quarter then. In any for-profit it has to basically justify how it'll make them more money. You want to do right by the costumer and handle their #1 complain? Prove that it would make the costumers throw more money at it (hard to prove) and/or that it would get you more customers (but be aware the #1 complaint of costumers, who pay, may not be the #1 reason other people don't buy the game). You can't make a solid argument? Tough titties. So in any software company, you have to justify why you invest in what you invest. And it has to be proven to that. You want to lower loading screens because they take too long? Well you have to prove that it's the #1 customer complain, and then prove how much money is potentially lost by frustrated players leaving, or not even trying online once because they won't go over the loading screens. Who knows if the people who can make this argument have access to the data to make the argument though, that's just the realities of large companies. Once you have a justification for why this is worth it, you can use it to justify if there's a cost-effective way to do it. So then you get the data, show that it's a problem with a solution, and propose an answer. At this point most software engineers would have already spent ~20% of their time for a month or more on this. That's a huge hit on their performance, and it could put their job on the line if it doesn't pay off. If it turns out people aren't that interested, or that there's no easy way to do a large enough improvement (that is you could shave some seconds and still have it in the order of minutes which is just as bad) then you lost. So it's hard for people to prioritize this. Some companies do a lot of work to try to avoid falling in that scenario. That they can have engineers exploring and solving general problems that may not be obvious, but add up to the total money the game makes. Rockstar doesn't seem to have it, you could tell even before this argument.  
It just shows how little they care.  
I assume many engineers tried to fix it over the years and one or more managers/executives stopped them.  Due to ignorance, stupidity and/or lack of consideration for users.  
Suit: What are you working on? Dev: I'm fixing a problem where levels take way too long to load, leaving the player in a loading screen for a long time. Suit: What is the business value of that? Dev: Well, it's a better experience for the player if they aren't stuck in a loading screen, and increases the quality of our product. Suit: But what is the business value in that? Dev: People don't like to wait in loading screens. Long loading screens will make people think poorly of our game, and some will probably quit altogether. Suit: I'll schedule a meeting to assign this to a business analyst for research so we can define measurables for this feature. Dev: That's really not necessary, it'll just take me a couple more hours- Suit: Do me a favor and write a business-case report on this, then add these five new microtransactions to the game.  
This article was really insightful! I've always wondered what was going on in the code while waiting eons for GTAO to load. This is super embarrassing for Rockstar. This has been a well-known issue since GTAO was released, and it turns out to be something so simple.   I wonder how many millions of dollars Rockstar has missed out on from users being frustrated with long load times and closing the game. Meanwhile, some random guy with no access to the source code was able to solve this problem with about 100 lines of code

Metoo on this. It was just insane waiting for this game to load on very good hardware. Not even talking about how missions and stuff lobbies work in assholish ways like for example if one player quits mission stops. If gtav crashes mission stops. Can't join a friend in a mission. It's basically year 2001 in there.

As web dev, we literally get torn to hell if the site loads too long.  I'd be surprised if Rockstar, being as massive as they are, didn't take it into account. Maybe they realize that those who stayed are more willing to suffer and spend more money?

I respect him just for giving that much of a shit  
Feel bad tho. "Please fix"? After 7 years rockstar dont care. There is bug in the game that stops new missions after 52% completion and rockstars official solution is start the story mode over again.  
I have a video on YouTube demonstrating a bug in GTA Online that makes it impossible to complete the Agent ULP mission. It's now March 2021 which means that I uploaded that video two-and-a-half over three years ago. I still get comments on it to this day of people saying that the bug still persists.  Edit: I checked the date on that video. The upload date was Dec 15, 2017 which means it's actually over three years old, yet the bug still persists.

Considering the mammoth amount of hard programming problems that were solved to make this game I'm really shocked that something this easy to fix made it through.  
I'm not surprised that it made it through at all. A function accidentally did way slower processing than the developer thought it did and that's just things that happen. Not fixing it on the other hand...  
‚ÄúHey can we devote a sprint to looking into the loading times, they seem to be pretty bad‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat? No absolutely not. We need to ship more content‚Äù  
God damn it I can totally imagine managers saying that shit. IDK how many suggestions I've made to improve a process or rework some code that would take AT MOST a few days that could pay off huge (like weeks saved easily) that got ignored due to not having the time or budget. Basic shit like can we get a debugger setup for this project? would be met with NO FEATURES ARE MORE IMPORTANT AND WE HAVE NO TIME FOR TOOLS!!. But then debugging manually takes significantly longer (I'm talking freaking prints...) so more time ends up being wasted than if we just got a debugger setup in the first place. R* easily let millions of hours be wasted by players, probably missed out on millions in additional revenue from players who stopped playing because load times increased beyond what they felt like was worth it, and all for maybe a few grand worth of developer wages.

I work in software engineering so I can completely understand how this came to pass. However, I can also understand an "outsider's" perspective. What people need to consider when scrutinizing a company's software product is scale, as in the sheer number of people working on it. The engineer who wrote the code for parsing the JSON could have been new to the gig and is far removed from the other engineers that actually use it. Since the code works, there's likely no communication between the author and the users. Consequently, the users just assumed that the long loading times would be expected given that parsing a JSON file is far from the only thing the loading process actually does. The problem from the product consumer perspective is that the load times did not make the cut when determining what the priorities are. As a result, no one at Rockstar has bothered looking into why it takes so long.

At one point this probably worked fine. This issue is processing time increases exponentially. So there are 63 thousand items now. With half that ~32k you reduce load times by 75% from 6 min to 1.5. Half again to ~16k and load times are down 87.5% to 45sec. This was probably initially tested with dozens or hundreds of items. Even low thousands and it would have completed almost instantly. But whoever did the design should have known the impact of this design and done it the right way initially even if it took a little more development time.  
I actually don't find the fact that it was overlooked to be a big deal. You can't get everything right up front and you don't want to go prematurely optimizing things. The fact that it existed for 7 or 8 years as a pretty huge time suck is what is hard to imagine.

I wouldn't believe it if it wasn't for the impressive article. The biggest game on the planet, probably the best game devs in the industry, 7 years after release, by far the most common complaint about the game. And they didn't even do a cursory profile to find such a silly bug? How is that even remotely possible? Finding and fixing something like this would be trivial with access to the code, even for someone fresh out of university. I was under the assumption that the loading time was done for political/marketing reasons ("look at our logos"), anti-cheat or something out of the ordinary. But json parsing? I still find it hard to believe this was just not caught.  
Both of the problems identified by the article author were dramatically worse with data size. Quite likely, during early testing the game did not have a noticeable problem calling sscanf and searching hashes because the data size was small, but over time as the release date approached, the JSON ballooned to 10MB and nobody had a handle on the load-time problem. Then they chose to "solve" it with loading screens instead of assigning developers to identify and fix the issue, because of all the normal reasons: leadership made a bad decision, or the people who wrote the original code had left the company, or they felt there wasn't time to diagnose the issue properly, maybe they had other issues that crashed the game and only just managed to solve those before release so this one wasn't top priority. Not saying it's right, but all of these are common.

But as this article proves, this is a crazy simple problem to diagnose and fix.  If 1 guy without source access could do it, any competent engineer on their team should've been able to do it.  The fact that this wasn't found shows that over the course of 7 years, not a single person has even attempted to profile and fix this issue.  
It's entirely possible the developers are working a demoralizing job and have no real motivation to do anything that's not on a ticket. And if the leadership saw more value in microtransactions than fixing loading time, it will never get a ticket. That's my guess.

I've played *a lot* of GTAO in the last year.  I'm pretty sure the "best game devs" that developed it (not disputing that!) have long since moved onto something else and the core game engine is mostly being maintained by a couple of overworked Eastern European guys making coal miner wages.  There's been virtually no technological improvements to the game in years.  Obviously some investment in content and gameplay (Cayo Perico Heist is great!), but as far as core engine systems I doubt there's much going on there just based on how little investment they are putting into curbing exploits, modders, and other annoyances. Edit:  My comment about Eastern European developers is intended to convey that they‚Äôre incredibly talented and taken advantage of by Western companies by grossly underpaying them.  
Good point. However even more painful to see their work suffer like this. GTA5 was and still is a technical marvel in many regards.

I don't think I could put up with even 1m50s of load time. Great job cutting out over 3m though.  
To be fair, if the improvement is consistent, those with modern machines could get it within 18-55 seconds.

And often you would repeatedly have to load in a row because the mission soft locked somehow or the lobby doesn't start or a cheater just took over the lobby. Would be interesting to crunch the numbers on how much electricity the world has spent on GTAV loading times so far. It might even be a significant number.

Claps to the author!!  
He should be paraded around tbh. Collectively the time people have spent waiting for that single core to do this useless work could probably counted in years if not decades.  
It's in the order of magnitude of 5000-20000 years of wasted compute time (if each player loaded gta online 10 times) considering they sold 140 million copies. This is one of those times the leetcode problems seem worth it lol.

Note I doubt very much this comes down to engineer talent, I‚Äôm sure there are engineers yelling I‚Äôd mostly guess this is two things.  They are probably using some kind of off the shelf JSON parser.  The offending stuff is probably deep in some black box dll.   And I would be very surprised if R* doesn‚Äôt know the json parsing is causing that. They‚Äôve probably suggested switching it, but gotten the Kibosh due to the inherent risk there. Management just doesn‚Äôt want to prioritize that.

 I really am surprised they put zero engineering effort into improving performance for their cash cow...  Probably because there's a lack in competition. It's not like the players can go anywhere else. I don't get why they supply the data as JSON at all. It's not like their system is open for 3rd parties. It only needs to deliver the data to their own application that runs on an x86 architecture, so they might as well deliver the list in a binary format that's optimized for C++.

It only needs to deliver the data to their own application that runs on an x86 architecture, so they might as well deliver the list in a binary format that's optimized for C++.  I don't think JSON is really the problem - parsing 10MB of JSON is not so slow. For example, using Python's json.load takes about 800ms for a 47MB file on my system, using something like simdjson cuts that down to ~70ms. I think the problem is more that they didn't go beyond the "it doesn't crash, let's not touch it again" stage. If they managed to botch the JSON parsing in such a way, I think they may also have managed to mess up parsing whatever optimized binary format.

If they managed to botch the JSON parsing in such a way, I think they may also have managed to mess up parsing whatever optimized binary format.  
 I really am surprised they put zero engineering effort into improving performance for their cash cow...  Probably because there's a lack in competition. It's not like the players can go anywhere else. I don't get why they supply the data as JSON at all. It's not like their system is open for 3rd parties. It only needs to deliver the data to their own application that runs on an x86 architecture, so they might as well deliver the list in a binary format that's optimized for C++.

Note I doubt very much this comes down to engineer talent, I‚Äôm sure there are engineers yelling I‚Äôd mostly guess this is two things.  They are probably using some kind of off the shelf JSON parser.  The offending stuff is probably deep in some black box dll.   And I would be very surprised if R* doesn‚Äôt know the json parsing is causing that. They‚Äôve probably suggested switching it, but gotten the Kibosh due to the inherent risk there. Management just doesn‚Äôt want to prioritize that.

This is insane. My company dedicates a significant amount of profiling and measurement to startup, where even adding a few milliseconds to startup time gets flagged as something to eliminate if at all possible. That Rockstar never considered similar profiling and protection for their startup times is beyond belief.

Very well written article. I used to write Game trainers a long time ago, doing a bit of reverse engineering(much lighter that what you can read in the article - the games were also less complex back then). This reading sparked my curiosity, and I sort of want to dig a bit into the software that was mentioned there.

I'm a bit confused, why is sscanf and strlen so bad?  
It calls sscanf() to read each number from the JSON (of which there are a lot) and apparently the implementation of sscanf() is very dumb and calls strlen() which scans to the end of the (very long) string. This seems like a bug in sscanf() to me. A reasonable implementation would not need to call strlen(), but it's still mad that they didn't find such an obvious bug. Edit: I found the code - you can see it here. Interestingly glibc does exactly the same thing. They reuse scanf() which takes a FILE argument, and FILE requires a length, so it calls strlen(). Definitely a bug (a pretty serious one I would have thought!) in Microsoft and GNU's libcs. The GTA developers' code is perfectly reasonable. They did nothing wrong (apart from ignoring such a huge bug for years). Definitely a bug in libc.  
It‚Äôs a classic ‚ÄúSchlemiel the painter‚Äù issue, even down to the reliance on strlen(). Imagine someone painting lines on a road, but instead of carrying the bucket with them, they keep running back to the start to dip their brush again and again. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an issue with sscanf(), though. I‚Äôm not sure how sscanf() could even work if it didn‚Äôt check the length of the incoming string. Rather the issue is the author of the ersatz JSON parser didn‚Äôt understand how sscanf() works and used it inappropriately, which is another element the ‚ÄúSchlemiel the painter‚Äù problem.  
 I‚Äôm not sure how sscanf() could even work if it didn‚Äôt check the length of the incoming string  It doesn't need to check the length, it simply needs to check if the character it's currently on is the null terminator

I'm a bit confused, why is sscanf and strlen so bad?  
They are not bad.  It was their use of it.  Their parser did not scale linearly O(N) with the number of items, but by quadratically O(N^2) which isn't noticeable with a few items but really bogs down over time. I get the feeling their they thought they set it up O(N) but didn't actually test it.

Makes me wonder if you could just replace the downloaded JSON string with something much shorter through a proxy server and decrease the loading times that way. You might not have the items in game, but if it's not game breaking, could be a win

They say  "we believe" so we cant hold them accountable for it.

AMD:  Variant One - [...] - Resolved by software [...]  Researchers:  A PoC for variant 1 that [...] can perform arbitrary reads in a 4GiB range [3] in kernel virtual memory on the Intel Haswell Xeon CPU. If the kernel's BPF JIT is enabled (non-default configuration), it also works on the AMD PRO CPU. (Source: https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.de/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html)  I'm not happy that they're basically saying: "Don't implement JIT compilers in kernel space assuming that our CPU works according to the specification." I would guess it's possible that this problem could return in the next JIT compiler or maybe even a regular kernel function if the code is not thoroughly checked.  
"Don't implement JIT compilers in kernel space" seems a generally sound sounding bit of advice either which way ;)

 Their design was just bad.  I'd say the design simply didn't address security at all. Someone got task "improve performance", and security was not on the requirements list, so was not considered :)  
This is the root cause for 99% of security vulnerabilities.  
Security should always be on the list when considering design. Doesn't matter what level or if it's hardware or software. This should be as ubiquitous in the industry as checklists are in hospitals. I mean, I made myself laugh just saying that, but I still think it's true even if it'll never happen.

That doesn't even begin to make sense.  The NSA/CIA/DOD themselves run hundreds of thousands of servers and workstations on the same exact same Intel hardware that you use.  Also, this attack would be near useless to the intelligence community.  You can only really exploit it if you're already able to run code on the same physical hardware as your target, and this vulnerability has been getting built into hardware since before cloud computing was even a thing. The Management Engine issues - I could totally see that being some NSA backdoor.  However, insecure branch prediction would be a weird rabbit hole to program in.  
But it‚Äôs possible to write software that adds delays, and which mitigates the ability to use this side channel. The Mozilla blog just posted what they‚Äôre doing in Firefox to close the hole while the bug persists[1]. So someone who knows of the bug can protect themselves from it.  OTOH ... these kinds of deliberate holes tend to be penny wise and pound foolish, flawed for the same reason as security by obscurity and trusting the enemy not to know the system. The costs of working around the deficiency tend to vastly exceed the security advantages.  [1] Edit: Link.

2006 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.190.1003&rep=rep1&type=pdf  Information leakage through covert channels and side channels is becoming a serious problem, especially when these are enhanced by modern processor architecture features. We show how processor architecture features such as simultaneous multithreading, control speculation and shared caches can inadvertently accelerate such covert channels or enable new covert channels and side channels.

That patch is only about Meltdown, it doesn't do anything for Spectre. Spectre does work on AMD and even on non x86 architectures. It has been demonstrated on ARM and is fully expected to work on modern PPC and MIPS.  
that exploit runs on more platforms than java and next to java i probably still prefer it

 but it is designed as crap  Not really. It was designed to boost performance, and it does that just fine. Simply no-one considered the security implications of this.  
It's not really true to say that security wasn't considered at all. Speculative execution is designed to wait for security checks before making the results of execution visible by conventional means. That's why the attack relies on detecting the results via unconventional means, by information leaking through side-channels such as how long it takes to access something in memory. It's likely that engineers did consider the possibility of these side-channel attacks, they've been speculated about for some time, but didn't think there was any practical way to use them.

I still dont understand how could js code exploit these vulnerabilities  
In the end, JS is translated to machine code just like everything else. It's just another programming language running on your computer. It shouldn't have access to much, being in a browser environment and all, but at the end of the day that's just a detail and not a particular important one.  
The subtlety is that it requires specific CPU instructions, for some of these exploits (Meltdown), which wouldn't be produced by JavaScript.  
The reason Meltdown isn't accessible from JS isn't a lack of access to specific machine instructions, it's a lack of arbitrary memory access. Meltdown happens by speculatively executing assembly past a page fault. Javascript doesn't let you create raw pointers (unless you also have a bug in your js transpiler) so you can't trigger this. Spectre doesn't require raw pointers, only branch prediction pollution (execute a lot of branches that are positive, to train the predictor to think similar branches will be positive) and the ability to measure L1 cache population via precise timing measurements. You can't do anything about the former, so browser vendors are considering ways to make the latter more difficult.

I still dont understand how could js code exploit these vulnerabilities  
In Spectre paper there is an example... tl;dr: javascript gets translated to assembly/machine code before execution because your CPU can only run machine code. It gets translated in predictable way, so you know exactly what code will run on target machine and it doesn't matter if the initial code was written in javascript or anything else. Both attacks depend on the fact that you can run code on target machine, and in case of javascript you can.  
If I'm not mistaken, meltdown also depends on the fact that you can execute a custom and illegal memory access (which would result in a page fault if executed in-order). I don't think that's possible in javascript.  
I still dont understand how could js code exploit these vulnerabilities  
Javascript cannot be used to read kernel memory with this vulnerability, nor can it be used to "take over" your computer. However, researchers were able to construct a javascript program using the same technique that lets the javascript code escape the sandboxing and read memory from within its own process. So if two web pages are using the same process (which has been normal until now), information could leak between the two.  
But doesn't Chrome (and recently firefox?) spawn a new process for each tab? I though that was why Chrome was so memory heavy and why a crash in one tab does not affect the whole browser? If so, this exploit shouldn't affect Chrome?

"Intel believes these exploits do not have the potential to corrupt, modify or delete data." Clever. Leaving out steal or read.

Must be kind of painful to have all this memory protection infrastructure on your chip, only to find out that it has been completely worthless. I wonder whether there is anything in the Intel architecture documentation specifying that user-space really cannot access kernel space memory. (Leaking enough information to reconstruct kernel space memory is equivalent of course. ) I.e., the manual does state that direct accesses are forbidden, but whether they guarantee anything beyond that?

The memory protection support in processors is designed to fulfill the needs of operating systems, not some abstract need: processors need to read from memory to do useful work. It is operating systems that want to isolate processes from one another, and they generally need hardware assistance to do so efficiently. The underlying issue is that operating systems are finding more and more possible exploits, so that they need more and more robust protection against complicated threat models. And this kind of side-channel attack means the drive for more performance using speculative execution, etc., (which is a direct requirement of the processor) is not available to the OS's defending against this exploit. Until this kind of exploit was discovered, things like timing attacks using deliberate kernel protection faults were not obviously part of the OS requirements. I think it is completely unfair of Linus and other to expect that hardware magically protect against all side channel attacks including undiscovered ones. That would require either supremely conservative performance (slow down everything to match the slowest path, so that there is no timing attack), or insanely complicated design to figure out where performance gains could only include provably safe variations in time.  
 I think it is completely unfair of Linus and other to expect that hardware magically protect against all side channel attacks including undiscovered ones.   Is that what he's doing, though?  He wants them to admit there is a serious problem and stop spinning it as a Nothing Burger (TM).  
Well, he has declared the CPU's "crap" designed in a way that is not "competent." If this attack channel was so goddamn obvious, why hasn't the Linux kernel been aggressively considering timing attacks like these and already had these protections in place? The answer is that just about every freaking kernel programmer was ignoring the issue as well. But, hey, not going to call them incompetent crap engineers, are we? No, that must have all been on the hardware folks. Any design has to be made in the context of requirements: someone high up would have to say "no timing attacks possible against attempted memory protection violations" before you could say that. I don't think any CPU vendor has that in mind, I'm guessing if they avoided such faults, it's because they got lucky when designing the memory protection logic and weren't being as aggressive in developing their speculative execution. The other aspect is that you can have legitimate disagreement about where the line between OS and hardware support lies. If there is a tradeoff between side-channel exposure and performance, the hardware guy can't deliver maximum performance unless he lets the software opt out. Then whoever is delivering the software needs to decide whether their system should slow down to be more secure (e.g. flushing more stuff on protection faults). If I'm running an Intel CPU with all my code and no external code, why the fuck should I have to possibly slow down my memory accesses to prevent me spying on myself?

The press release says they do not believe the flaws allow hackers to delete or manipulate data, but recent news reports never said the flaws allowed that ... the N.Y. Times says it allows for hackers to potentially copy/steal the entire memory contents of your computer/mobile phone.   
And the memory contents of cloud servers *

I agree Intel needs to fix their processors but isn't this an universal issue? The Meltdown paper mentions, in section 6.4, that for ARM and AMD "out-of-order execution generally occurs and instructions past illegal memory accesses are also performed". And Spectre also works on ARM and AMD architecture. Edit: As several people have pointed out, the current variant of Meltdown doesn't work on AMD. This patch confirms this.

 but these can be fixed without patching the kernel.  To be more precise, these have to be fixed without patching the kernel. There is no sane* kernel patch which could fix userspace to userspace leakages. *There are several insane patches kernel patches you could do; Things like disabling all memory caches or disabling all branch prediction, but these would result in an absolutely massive performance degradation.

 The Meltdown paper mentions, in section 6.4, that for ARM and AMD "out-of-order execution generally occurs and instructions past illegal memory accesses are also performed".  As far as I understand the toy example in 3 only shows that out of order execution has observable effects, however it does not involve any secret fetched from the kernel and instead uses a fixed value to perform the out of order load, nothing really questionable about that1 . The exploit itself tries to fetch a value from kernel memory to perform the lookup and that could not be reproduced on AMD.   And Spectre also works on ARM and AMD architecture.  Different exploit that actually affects all and isn't fixed by the recent patch afaik.  1 Actually it might make it impossible for an in process sandbox to hide anything reliably from untrusted code. Then again, who regularly runs large amounts of untrusted code on his system. Most people just browse anyway and we all know that the few hundred scripts and ad providers on cnn.com are completely trustworthy.  
That's true. They were unable to successfully leak kernel memory. Although they do mention that an optimized or modified version may succeed even on ARM and AMD.  
The paper says that they don't know why and just assume that it may be possible. This kernel patch says that it isn't on AMD.

I think Intel knows they have problems, why else would the ceo dump company stock?  
 I think Intel knows they have problems  99% of that is of their own doing though. They have been becoming less and less competitive over time and trying to rest on their lead. I know quite a few people that work there and they say it's a shitshow. Mostly things like dumping projects and realising they were needed and restarting them or reinventing the wheel because of flawed logic. Just management fuckery, trying to seem like you are busy but you are just moving paper from one table to another.   why else would the ceo dump company stock  The stock is overpriced as it is, in a few years given the current strategy from them I wouldn't be surprised if it was in a much worse state.   
They've been flying around with no direction for quite a few years now. They were too late to get into the smart phone processor market, and have been going into several directions at once after they blew it. I'm glad I dumped their shares a while back. Any company they touch or buy seems to get poisoned or withers on the vine.   
I think Intel knows they have problems, why else would the ceo dump company stock?  
Honestly?  He gets a large portion of his compensation in company stock; he is required to keep 250k shares.  Anything over and above that is cashed out and diversified, probably on an annual basis.  Pretty smart. Google indicated that their engineers shared these findings with Intel on Jun 1, 2017, so his recent stock dump is unlikely to have been related.  
 Google indicated that their engineers shared these findings with Intel on Jun 1, 2017, so his recent stock dump is unlikely to have been related.  If you look at the timeline:  Intel was notified. (June) Intel had a quarterly investors meeting where they didn't mention that a bug this big existed to investors. (?) Intel CEO puts in stock plan. (October?) Stock plan executes. (November?) Bug becomes public. (January)  it's entirely possible that the CEO's stock plan was affected by the not-yet-public news.  
If he does the same thing every year at the same moment, should he have change is investment tactics? I doubt its insider trading if he have been doing the same things for years.

Inventor says Google is patenting work he put in the public domain
The stupid thing about how software patents work is that if you don't apply for it, anybody else could try to do so later and if they succeed (which is always a chance since patent officers often have no idea what the fuck they're doing), they can fuck you over with it. I could imagine that Google just decided to try as hard as possible to patent whatever the fuck they can about this important new technology... if they fail, they at least made (relatively) certain that nobody else can later do it either. The best option for the inventor would've probably been to patent it himself and grant the world an irrevokable royalty-free license, rather than not patenting it at all. Patents are not free, unfortunately, but it seems that he cares enough about this that he might have been willing to put out the money. With the way this stupid system works, the only way you can make sure that nobody else takes it is to claim it for yourself.

An expensive process that could sink a lot of people. I believe people that work at the patent office have already come out and said they mostly look at already issued patents as proof of prior existence if it's not there they approve and just let people challenge it in court. Essentially not doing their job and putting the burden on the judicial system. Things so stupid like using a stick to play fetch are patented. Common sense is not allowed to be used when approving or denying patents.

 Essentially not doing their job and putting the burden on the judicial system  This is the only sensible thing they could do. The cost and difficulty of really deciding if a patent should be valid is immense. Making that effort for every filed patent would be hugely wasteful and downright insane. Instead, the patent granting process is a sort of first-pass filter that eliminates patents that are unequivocally bad, but doesn't try to be conclusive. Sure, this leads to waste when patents get contested, but the waste is much less, and the burden is shouldered by interested private parties instead of being paid for with tax dollars. I do think that there are serious problems with the patent system, but having the patent office do more work up front is not the solution to any of them.

From what I gather from the article, this is less of a question of who invented it and more of a question of whether Google added enough on their own to be worth an independent patent. This is even more reason why the original inventor should have patented it himself, I think. Because then he could have set license terms that prevent others from doing a tiny bit of derivative work and then claiming their own patent on that. We really need something like a copyleft for patents.

So if I add a public license, like gpl, to my code someone could still patent it?  
I'm not really sure, I'm not a patent lawyer. There's some important distinction between first to file vs. first to invent that plays a role there. There's also a thing called "prior art" which allows you to invalidate a patent later if you can show that someone else did it first. However, the way these things usually turn out is more complicated: it's more likely that somebody will take your GPLv2 code, make some minor improvement to it or reapply it to a slightly different use case, and then somehow convince a patent office (which are mostly run by laymen who don't care) that this change is significant enough to be worth its own patent. If they can get that patent granted, they can then prevent anyone (including you) from using that improvement or applying your code to that separate use case, even if you came up with it independently. (Their code would still have to be released under the GPL because copyright and patents are two completely orthogonal things, but you wouldn't be allowed to use that "open-source" code without violating their patent.) For that reason, it's generally a good idea to use open source licenses with explicit patent clauses to prevent this shit, like the GPLv3 or the Apache license.  
So if I add a public license, like gpl, to my code someone could still patent it?  
Yes. Licenses are not patents.   
Doesn't matter.  Patents have to be novel.  If you can prove that someone else came up with it first, then they can't patent it.

Isn't this just proof the whole patent system is broken and needs destroying? We could easily share ideas without worrying about anyone stealing. We all benefit more from collaboration instead   
The alternative is to instead have everything be guarded as a trade secret, which would slow down progress immensely. With patents, the inventor gets some protection, in exchange for disclosure that anyone else can build on and improve.  
Except that you can't build and improve on something that you're not allowed to use because someone else has a patent. Trade secrets are still a thing anyway. Nobody patents shit that really gives them a big competitive advantage and can reasonably be kept secret today. The patent system is outdated and needs to either get a major overhaul or just be abolished. FWIW I think all the claims that without patents nobody would invent anything anymore are bullshit FUD. These days, first-to-market is plenty of incentive in and off itself.

It worked in the short term. If it was still working, they wouldn't have changed it. These days, the talented developers are more likely to be working on linux-based OS's and languages. Without changing, they would be Oracle.

It is a good thing. But people are still gonna comment saying how this pledge is not enforceable and how they could turn evil in the future. And maybe that is true but making a pledge like this is a very good indication that Google won't use patents offensively. Plus, it would be a massive PR shitstorm if Google suddenly took down the page and reneges on the pledge.

I don't like the concept of a patent in software in general.  It feels for me like you want to patent a book story...   
There is a huge difference in software patents between the US and Europe. In Europe patenting software is almost impossible.

You can't compare the two just because they're both written. A book doesn't do anything. There are reasons for patenting software that don't apply to a story.  
Not very good ones. Your innovations are already covered by copyright, so long as you keep them close to the chest. Now we have a framework for patenting math.  
Unless I'm mistaken, copyright doesn't offer the same protections that a patent does. Most software probably doesn't need to be patented. Some of it does.  Taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patent_debate#Arguments_for_patentability  Patents protect functionality. Copyright on the other hand only protects expression. Substantial modification to an original work, even if it performs the same function, would not be prevented by copyright. To prove copyright infringement also requires the additional hurdle of proving copying which is not necessary for patent infringement. Copyright law protects unique expressions, while patent law protects inventions, which in the case of software, are algorithms; copyright cannot protect a novel means of accomplishing a function, merely the syntax of one such means.[8]

This is the best tl;dr I could make, original reduced by 93%. (I'm a bot)   A Google spokesperson told Ars that Duda came up with a theoretical concept that isn't directly patentable, while Google's lawyers are seeking to patent a specific application of that theory that reflects additional work by Google's engineers. Over the last couple of months, we've repeatedly asked Google to put us in touch with a Google technology expert who can explain exactly what Google invented and how it goes beyond Duda's own work. Google never made someone like that available to us, so we can't explain how Google distinguishes its own invention from Duda's original work.

What was once all of Google became Alphabet at some point (with Google as a subset), and Alphabet has no such pledge. Not saying the people are right about Google removing "don't be evil," but that's likely where the misconception arises (and to be fair, it was real bad optics for Alphabet to not retain "don't be evil")

Patenting software doesn't make sense. Copyrighting it, however, does. Anyway, this just goes to show how much patents prove a lack of novelty.  
It's idiotic. My company is always writing patents for things that we haven't even necessarily done or made work. There's just this idiotic patent quota given to us. Management is incompetent.  
The old image of somebody presenting a working prototype to the patent office is novel. Don't even need to actual working prototype or something that could ever work for that matter.

Everyone take a breath and read the article. Google have recognized that Duda invented the theoretical foundations of ANS. What they are patenting is a specific implementation, which is exactly what parents are for.  Duda claims that he suggested this implementation to Google engineers via email. That is the crux of the dispute, meaning this isn't a broader question about software patents. On the topic though, software patents are the nukes of the software world. No one particularly likes them, but they have to maintain an arsenal of them for deterrence reasons. This disincentives large firms from suing one another non-stop, since it would carry a near-certain counter-suit. If you don't like software patents, you can go yell at the USPTO. Google, Facebook, Apple, et al. are acting rationally within the system that exists by trying to patent everything they can.

The 'specific application' that Google have 'invented' amounts to 'use ANS to compress video'. That is a trivially obvious application of ANS, and one that was specifically proposed by Jarek already.  If you invent a new compression method then deciding to use it in places that other compression methods are already being used is not a novel invention. Otherwise what stops me from patenting 'use ANS to compress text files', or 'use ANS to compress my parent's tax return' or 'use ANS to compress binaries of compression applications'? Patents are supposed to be non-obvious to a skilled person.  Given ANS itself has prior art, Google's argument for their video patent is nonsense and they should be ashamed of themselves. Rather than engaging in MAD, Google and other technology companies should be using their lobbying power to persuade legislators to reform the system to ensure that software is not patentable.

They're okay with it. They'll make more money than the fines.  
Which is exactly the problem with our legal system. Many laws don't apply to the rich, because they can just continue to pay the fines and never have a dent in their wallet. It's like if you were fined a penny for stealing. You'd be like "woah! I just paid a penny for a loaf of bread instead of the normal price! Might as well just keep stealing it!"

So if I'm understanding the GPLv2 license properly. In order for TikTok to be compliant, they must release their source code publicly?  
Yep. With LGPL you could avoid this by bundling the LGPL code into an open-source library, and then linking against that library in your closed-source project. But under GPLv2 this is prohibited, so they would have to open source their entire app.  
Sexy Cyborg (u/sexycyborg) really did a good one on one such issue where she went personally to a company and had them give her the source code. The BS chinese company said they will only give the source code in a pendrive to someone who goes to their office in Shenzen, when the international community asked them to do so (since they were claiming to be compliant) So someone reached out to Sexy Cyborg and she did all the foot work in getting the source code lol. She is a badass.

Oh that's interesting. On Android wouldn't it be technically possible? You could have it not supported in the main app store version, but provide an APK that uses intents to allow users who really want to to hook their own streaming app in.

So if I'm understanding the GPLv2 license properly. In order for TikTok to be compliant, they must release their source code publicly?  
They either have to release their source code (and license it as GPLv2) or change their code to invoke OBS as a separate process. OBS probably doesn't support seamlessly doing that. It's the combining of the two codebases that makes it noncompliant.  
The GPL copyleft doesn't trigger when you combine code in the same process, it triggers when you do so in the same "program"; the definition of such being more than a little murky legally speaking. But I imagine that a judge would consider a process-separated OBS to be the same program for the purposes of the GPL. After all, there are plenty of ways for multiple processes to act as a single program (otherwise Google Chrome would have never gotten off of the ground).  
Worth noting Apple seem to take this interpretation. Clang exists because their lawyers suggested that the 'linking' issue was merely technical and a judge would likely see out of process as part of the same work.

After all, there are plenty of ways for multiple processes to act as a single program (otherwise Google Chrome would have never gotten off of the ground).  
The GPL triggers when you create a derivative work, this is inherent to the words "based on" in the license. Traditionally, static and dynamic linking are said to create derivative works. Some other interactions are a little hazier. But all tests aside, this particular tool is just OBS with a few UI tweaks, so... It's pretty clearly a derivative work on its face. I am not your attorney and this is not legal advice.

Not publicly, no. That's a common misconception with GPL. They must give everyone a reasonable path to requesting and receiving source, but they themselves don't have to make it public.  
To be compliant, their source must be licensed as GPL. So the first person to request and receive it can then distribute it freely.  
To get the source code all you have to do is drop by our office in China!

 I'd argue it's part of their culture. They don't recognize piracy/duplication the same way we do.  "The Hardware Hacker" by Bunnie Huang dives into this at a manufacturing level pretty well. From the section "Part 2 thinking differently: intellectual property in china":  One of the most insightful lean engineering practices enabling the creation of complex systems on a shoestring budget is the shanzhai method for sharing IP. I‚Äôll explore this by comparing and contrasting the Western notion of open source with the shanzhai method, which I refer to as gongkai. In Western law, open source has a formal definition, referring specifically to an IP sharing system governed by an explicit license to share. This license is granted by the copyright holder, often with significant commercial restrictions. Open source advocates vigorously defend this notion and are quick to dis-avow any IP that doesn‚Äôt explicitly use an approved license. In gongkai, if you can obtain a copy of the blueprints, you can use them as you please; it doesn‚Äôt matter who made them. Yet people still share their ideas because the blueprints act as an advertisement. Blueprints often refer explicitly to certain chips or contain contact information for the firm that drew them. The creators hope circulating their blueprints will bring business to their factory when people order parts or sub-assemblies referenced within, or when people call their firm to improve or customize the design. In other cases, blueprints are traded. For example, there are bulletin board exchanges where before you download a blueprint, you must contribute one of your own.

Stop using Tiktok.  Its poison.  
I'm convinced that TikTok is a Chinese tool of subversion. Look at the amount of damage that can be done with certain posts encouraging kids to cause mayhem. It's a great way to disrupt a society. War isn't only waged with bullets and bombs.  
lmao the same could be said for Youtube pal. Also, Tiktok is full of all sorts of content, e.g. educational discussion relating to space, geology, biology, etc, economic and political discussions, exercise, hiking, biking, crafting, welding, sewing, wood working, etc.

Right along with Reddit, Instagram, YouTube and Facebook. They are all just as bad. Actually, Instagram is absolutely worse.  
There is no way that Instagram is worse than tiktok. No chance at all  
In the other subthread you focus on addictiveness (although you mostly use anecdotal evidence, just because you're not addicted to IG doesn't mean others aren't). But you have to look at it from mental impact angle. Instagrams entire purpose in the teen world is posting content that make your life look better than it is, and looking at other people's (fake) amazing life. All it does is make teenagers insecure and depressed. It's ruining the mental health of all the teens worldwide. TikTok's content is very different from instagram. There's far less content focused on people showing off their beauty/lifestyle, and a lot more focus on funny, interesting or useful content. It's less selfies and more funny shit that happened. It's less thirst trap and more life hack and tips.

Yeah, stop using everything, but not Reddit, Reddit is the best!  
it has porn

It's crazy how addictive it is. The feed is tailored so well, crazy  
The person who designed the algorithm that feeds your page must be a genius. I don't think there is a website that knows what you wanna watch as well as tiktok.

It appears that their installer downloads OBS from the official site, installs it, and then installs their software that works with it. They haven't forked OBS, or modified it, if that's the case, they've simply written a proprietary application that automates OBS. If they're using OBS shared libraries then perhaps they're violating the GPL (but wouldn't be violating the LGPL - wonder how those libraries are licensed?). What they're doing, though, appears to be a more complex example of something like my Logitch mouse software pausing and playing VLC media player when I hit a mouse button. Apparently there is OBS source present in their software and the GPL doesn't give them the right to use that source without distributing the source of their own software. Sorry for the confusion.

 I'm wondering if there's any reason to keep paying for an individual dev account.  I'm going to guess "no." I suspect Microsoft is taking this the way of other developer tools they own: "If you do the sort of work that can make real money with our tools, we want our cut. Otherwise, do whatever you want."  
I can see the logic behind that, and seems quite fair IMO.   
It's been used by lots of very high end pricey software like CGI in a way. lack of private repos was one of the reason I used bitbucket.. maybe they want to take their market share too.

Yep. It's a great way to get people using their development platforms. I just wish they'd adopt a similar pricing model for their operating systems. Make Windows free for home/hobby use.  
They do seem to be leaning that way given how lax they still are with free upgrades even after it officially ended and non activation doesn't have the lock out period like older versions.

I second this. All of their frameworks and dev tools (that I have used) are well designed and documented and superior to their alternatives.

Does anyone know how this compares to Bitbucket and GitLab? Do they have higher collaborator caps for their free private repos?  
Gitlab have no limits on free private collaborators, their limit is harsh on CI free minutes though, which Github don't have. Free users also don't get things like full workflow on merge request approvals or epics or stats or code quality.

GitHub now gives free users unlimited private repositories
For the inevitable non-article-readers: private repositories by free accounts are limited to three collaborators each.  This is actually a pretty clever way for them to make their service more useful for personal projects by people who weren't going to pay anyway, while still charging for commercial use at scale.  
So this almost fits my needs for school projects, without worry someone will steal code cause issues.

This is really interesting. GitLab's biggest feature (in my opinion) was free private repos. This completely changes that.  
Gitlab also offers pretty good and free CI/CD for private repositories   
For free?  
Yes, completely free. Just like Travis or Drone. There is a bit of wait though, but no big deal.

What about GitLab actually having a free software project that you can self-host? GitHub kind of requires you to, you know, keep using GitHub. Perfect fit for Microsoft.  
Running it on my little raspberry pi just for my own little repos. Pretty sweet.  
Isn't that a little slow? Last time I set up a VCS on my Pi it felt slower than just using GitHub.

 I can understand the hate for their consumer products, but their developer product portfolio always seemed really solid.  Objections to Microsoft development tools aren't primarily about product quality, but about anti-competitive practices to privilege their product in the marketplace and extract rents from the industry. MS worked really hard historically to sabotage competing development tool vendors, with practices that might have been illegal under closer regulatory scrutiny.

In my experience, Bitbucket's website is so much slower, and the speed of networking with the repos was inconsistent. It wasn't worth the hassle of that, so I ended up paying for github private repos    
Not to mention it's down more often than it should.

I don't think Bitbucket will miss all those non paying users that much. Companies will keep using it because they're already using Jira.

And why would that be? I was under impression GitLab blew GitHub out of the water when it came to features.  
I believe that unlimited free private repos are one of the most powerful features of GitLab for regular non-business users.  
BitBucket had this as well. There was no mass exodus when it was available. Microsoft purchase did more for GitLab than private repos, in my opinion, so this piece of news is not really worrisome for GitLab (which is more oriented to self-hosting I believe), but just good news for GitHub users.

This is going to sound super shill-y, but MS is one of the companies I‚Äôve been most excited to watch recently. Been fascinating watching the Ballmer/pre-Ballmer style get slowly replaced by the Nadella style. It looks like a pretty substantial philosophy shift has occurred.

probably worried about how many people hopped off github onto gitlab when microsoft acquired them. BTW gitlab does unlimited private repos and collaborators. I'd like them more if they did proper pull requests instead of those weird merge request things >.>

Reddit's main code is no longer open-source.
 back in 2008, Reddit Inc was a ragtag organization1 and the future of the company was very uncertain. We wanted to make sure the community could keep the site alive should the company go under and making the code available was the logical thing to do  Translation: We needed you guys back then. We don't now. The rest of it seems like a combination of technical hurdles that don't seem particularly compelling (they don't need to have secret new feature branches in their public repo) and some that don't make any sense (how does a move away from a monolithic repo into microservices change anything?) and some that are comical (our shit's so complicated to deploy and use that you can't use it anyway) It's sad that their development processes have effectively resulted in administrative reasons they can't do it. I remember them doing shenanigans like using their single-point-of-failure production RabbitMQ server to run the untested April fools thing this year (r/place) and in doing so almost brought everything down. So I'm not surprised that there doesn't seem to be much maturity in the operations and development processes over there. To be fair though, the reddit codebase always had a reputation for being such a pain that it wasn't really useful for much. Thankfully, their more niche open source contributions, while not particularly polished and documented, might end up being more useful than the original reddit repo. I know I've been meaning to look into the Websocket one.  
I guess they dont know they could make a private repo and update origin after the feature is done.

 they don't need to have secret new feature branches in their public repo  They don't, but there is a trade-off here. Long-lived branches are harder to merge. Open source contributors can't merge a branch they don't have access to. That means someone internal has to choose between (1) making it a priority to merge open source contributions into the feature branch (and dealing with the risks or inconveniences that entails) and (2) dealing with a harder merge later on. That's probably doable, but it's not a fictitious difficulty.  
git rebase is your friend. If you have a feature branch, it's your responsibility to regularly rebase (daily, ideally) from master and keep it mergeable. Simple.

Just curious, are there are any companies that have moved to a microservice architecture that are open sourced? It does seem like it would be a lot harder to manage.

I think Netflix is a good example of one that open sources many of their components. As for one where the whole product is open source and microservice based, I'm not sure. I'm sure others might have an example in mind. Some quick Googling showed a few like Travis CI. In general, I don't feel like the (sometimes dubious) organizational benefits from microservice architectures are a good fit for FOSS development. They tend to be better with strong centralized policies, leadership, etc., spreading work out to many teams. Things like having good CI, testing, etc. practices are all very important. The ones I've found Googling around have all been similar to Travis CI and Reddit insofar as they are a public facing open source repo of an industry developed tool (using hosted as a service), so frankly I don't see this as a compelling reason to can all plans to keep reddit itself FOSS. Orchestrating it with tooling like Kubernetes would make it much easier to manage, but it looks like reddit's has a lot of homegrown code to glue it together.  
Yeah, I don't think Netflix is any more open source than Reddit is after this change. Probably less, since their more monolithic bits were never open source.

In general, I don't feel like the (sometimes dubious) organizational benefits from microservice architectures are a good fit for FOSS development. They tend to be better with strong centralized policies, leadership, etc., spreading work out to many teams. Things like having good CI, testing, etc. practices are all very important. The ones I've found Googling around have all been similar to Travis CI and Reddit insofar as they are a public facing open source repo of an industry developed tool (using hosted as a service), so frankly I don't see this as a compelling reason to can all plans to keep reddit itself FOSS. Orchestrating it with tooling like Kubernetes would make it much easier to manage, but it looks like reddit's has a lot of homegrown code to glue it together.  
Can you think of a SaaS product you've worked on where the product code wasn't intimately coupled to the automation code and deployment platforms? I certainly can't.  Netflix releases their tools as open source (and they have some pretty cool stuff) but they do not FOSS their product.

Out of curiosity - why do you think the benefits of microservice architectures are sometimes dubious?   
 back in 2008, Reddit Inc was a ragtag organization1 and the future of the company was very uncertain. We wanted to make sure the community could keep the site alive should the company go under and making the code available was the logical thing to do  Translation: We needed you guys back then. We don't now. The rest of it seems like a combination of technical hurdles that don't seem particularly compelling (they don't need to have secret new feature branches in their public repo) and some that don't make any sense (how does a move away from a monolithic repo into microservices change anything?) and some that are comical (our shit's so complicated to deploy and use that you can't use it anyway) It's sad that their development processes have effectively resulted in administrative reasons they can't do it. I remember them doing shenanigans like using their single-point-of-failure production RabbitMQ server to run the untested April fools thing this year (r/place) and in doing so almost brought everything down. So I'm not surprised that there doesn't seem to be much maturity in the operations and development processes over there. To be fair though, the reddit codebase always had a reputation for being such a pain that it wasn't really useful for much. Thankfully, their more niche open source contributions, while not particularly polished and documented, might end up being more useful than the original reddit repo. I know I've been meaning to look into the Websocket one.

Generally speaking, microservices architectures are (for better or worse) pretty closely coupled with their automation code and thus the platforms they run on. It's already difficult to get that stuff running in prod (staging too if you've got some cash): getting it set up so you can ship the whole thing to contributors is super difficult and it has diminishing returns. You're not just shipping code, you're shipping container orchestration configs, database configs, load balancing logic, and a bunch of other shit that isn't portable. It's one thing to have the code for the services available; if your contributors can't run it, it's not really open source. And having it out there in a broken state is worse than not having it at all. Reddit is SaaS and I don't know anyone who's been very successful at open-sourcing their MSA SaaS product.

If I read it right, it's not so much that it's "no longer" open source, but hasn't been truly open for a while now and they're just giving up on maintaining the open version.  Because of the above, our internal development, production and ‚Äúfeature‚Äù branches have been moving further and further from the ‚Äúcanonical‚Äù state of the open source repository. Such balkanization means that merges are getting increasingly difficult, especially as the company grows and more developers are touching the code more frequently.  So in effect, they made a private fork of their own code and it's now diverged to the point where they can't feasibly maintain both. It's sad but I suppose inevitable when your business model involves using your code rather than giving it to other people and selling support. Any users of your code are not potential customers but competitors. However, since their source apparently remains available under a semi-free copyleft license (CPAL), maybe there will be a community-maintained fork of some kind.

But a side benefit is that you're creating a new pool of future employees already familiar with your internal technology. I mean, imagine React was closed-sourced. It would be a nightmare to ramp-up new front-end devs.

Yeah, I think we should still be thankful Reddit gave the open source community as much as they did. I can't think of any other tech companies that open source so much of their code, so this is pretty much to be expected.

I'm no expert when it comes to code architecture and large codebases but it seems to me like their codebase is horribly organized with over a decade worth of code being written without any major cleanup being done. There is no way to understand how all these pieces fit together cuz there are no meaningful comments in most of the files. How do you even keep developing on this codebase as it's such a mess. Is this a shit codebase or am I simply too negative?   
 How do you even keep developing on this codebase as it's such a mess.  People who have been developing this mountain of shitty code either: 1. have been there such a long time, they hold the map to most of it in their head. 2. take a really long time to get familiar with it with the reluctant help of people who fall in category #1, and eventually they drift to #1 themselves.  
3 Don't have a work ethic and feel about wading through spaghetti code and taking weeks on a feature that should take hours roughly the same as working at a gas station: "Eh, it pays the bills" / just a job 4 Have a huge work ethic and great sense of architecture but after working with #3 for a while and trying to make changes either turns into #1 or #3 or quits the system in protest

/u/spladug:  we're a big enough company now that, unfortunately, we have to think about people trying to divine our strategy from the repos and beat us to the punch.  /u/Lt_Riza_Hawkeye:  Right, so why not push over all of the changes to the public repo AFTER videos have been implemented and are live on production, rather than during their implementation. It seems to me like that would solve both problems  /u/Kaitaan:  Because features aren't developed in a vacuum, especially when you're working with a monolith.  If, in your example, video was the only thing being worked on at a given time, then sure, that would be easy.  But if it's not (and really, what company is only doing one thing at a time), now someone has to go cherry-pick all the commits that were video-related, make sure they don't contain anything not video-related, make sure they don't rely on anything not video-related, redo all the testing, fix anything that was missing from those commits, and hope that nothing else changed while they were doing all the above.  That alone is a full-time job, and not a fun one.  I mean, isn't this precisely what branches are for? Serious question because I've never work on a large team. It seems they only have master, testing, and dev branches. Wouldn't it make sense to dev videos in one branch and secretx in another when you have 100 devs?

I‚Äôm speculating that closing their source code is the result of this recent ruling about ownership of content on social network sites. After all if your source code is already open and then it turns out you don‚Äôt even own your site content what unique assets do you actually have? reddit has always argued that they own a license to their user‚Äôs submissions but if this ruling weakens that argument then they probably have to take some steps to mollify their investors. Edit: for accuracy

So are they going to have problems in the future, since they took in code from outside devs?  They can't close source that code. Won't that limit reddit from ever selling their platform to others?  If they distribute anything, they would have to open source it.

If that means that they realise that they fucked up with the reddit app and the mobile site, then I'm all for it. /s They've wasted time and effort on an experience that is inferior and frankly poor for a company of reddit's stature. Also, they complain of the realities of being open source when they have 100 developers. Like having 100 developers is a huge deal. I work with companies many times larger who manage OSS, contributions and PRs without much effort. So, for reddit to turn around and moan about the effort required to balance between their private, proprietary code and their public OSS code shines a light on how bloated their codebase has become.

So sad that Aaron Swartz can't rest in peace.  
At least he didn't have to see reddit, a 12 year old site become a fucking corporation and not even have a rich text editor or fucking preview option when writing posts and comments. In the last 5 years reddit hasn't received any significant update that improves the experience for the end-user directly. I wrote about it at some length here https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/6xfyfg/an_update_on_the_state_of_the_redditreddit_and/dmg4c9x/?context=3 Yes, Aaron was a freedom advocate but I'm sure he knew the whole point of it was that open-source led to higher quality software. I'm sure he'd feel the same way as me looking at reddit as a major project, making major money (at least at keeping itself afloat) and not receiving a fucking update to basic functionalities in 5 years. Aaron was a programmer first and an advocate second. From that point of view, he'd look at reddit and think "welp, that's a dead project, it's going nowhere fast". May he RIP.

So many comments seem to think this is some indicator that they've turned evil. If they have, it's unrelated to this change. How useful was it ever that the codebase was open source? Did anyone ever stand up their own clone of reddit and run it on the open internet? It seems impractical to maintain a codebase like this in the open, and from what I've heard they're doing a major rewrite, which would make it even more complicated. If no one uses it, why maintain it?  
Less Wrong's discussion section is a Reddit instance, I think.

I wanted to stand up an internal clone of Reddit for my company to use as an internal discussion board alternative to email. Unfortunately, their licensing is too restrictive for me to do so anyway. So for me at least, Reddit being open source made no difference.   
What were the licensing terms that were a deal-breaker for your plan?

How We Built r/Place
Huh, it's interesting that support for bots was actually part of the design spec considering the controversy they caused. I don't disagree, it's just interesting.   
That's probably because it was supposed to be a short-lived project, so it even makes it interesting - first wave, only actual hand-crafted pixels, then a mix of hand-crafted and bots starting with a low percentage of bots and increasing... At the beginning the more interesting part is the collaboration between humans on the same project, but at the point where all "big" projects were controlled by bots, the most interesting part is the human interaction between projects to respect limits, etc  
Bots aren't inherently bad, either. We go crazy when we see them on social media and news commentary because those there are actual consequences to the ripples of distortion they cause. Outside of communication, we generally accept that bots are fascinating to design and watch. While bots on /r/Place diminished the power of individuals to interact with the board, those individuals were likely aware that they had little power to begin with. Within moments of encountering Place, any user could see that there was no way for order to defeat chaos so long as the two were equals. Maintaining an image required constant human interaction while destroying that same image hardly even required being awake--just click and repeat randomly. This immediately introduced the problem solving aspect of the setup. Individual users lost their power the moment subreddits and social networks opened up channels for organization. /r/BlueCorner made my efforts moot long before bots did. Bots, then, were an evolution of the competition. Had the time limit been endless, random users would have disappeared and their power would have grown ever greater.

 Maintaining an image required constant human interaction while destroying that same image hardly even required being awake--just click and repeat randomly.  There's a metaphor in here somewhere.

Bots aren't inherently bad, either. We go crazy when we see them on social media and news commentary because those there are actual consequences to the ripples of distortion they cause. Outside of communication, we generally accept that bots are fascinating to design and watch. While bots on /r/Place diminished the power of individuals to interact with the board, those individuals were likely aware that they had little power to begin with. Within moments of encountering Place, any user could see that there was no way for order to defeat chaos so long as the two were equals. Maintaining an image required constant human interaction while destroying that same image hardly even required being awake--just click and repeat randomly. This immediately introduced the problem solving aspect of the setup. Individual users lost their power the moment subreddits and social networks opened up channels for organization. /r/BlueCorner made my efforts moot long before bots did. Bots, then, were an evolution of the competition. Had the time limit been endless, random users would have disappeared and their power would have grown ever greater.

Huh, it's interesting that support for bots was actually part of the design spec considering the controversy they caused. I don't disagree, it's just interesting.   
This was probably influenced by the fantastic work people did on scripts for Robin -- adding channels (hashtags), spam filters, encrypted messaging, trivia bots, auto-voting on room changes.... Someone wrote code to reconstruct the ancestry of each chat and someone else presented it as a dashboard with countdowns and predictions. Someone even developed an IRC gateway for Robin. The developer community that sprang up around Robin was something that I found particularly interesting, and which I think was critical to keeping it as long-lived as it was (getting to T17 ccKufi).  
Holy shit. The button was 2015. I could have swore it was last year. Totally forgot about robin.   
Robin was definitely the least interesting of the three. I had forgotten about it within about a week. Still, that's better than most April Fools jokes.

Last year's April Fools on reddit. You'd start in a chat room with you and one other person and then you'd merge with another group of 2. Then 4, than 8.. It took longer each time because the room you merged with  had to be around the same size. The final merge days after April 1st of the two largest chat rooms of thousands of people literally broke reddit and they were forced to immediately end it.

Is there a chance we can get a raw data dump of all the activity on r/place?  Tuples of {timestamp, x, y, color}?  
Yeah, that'll be released at some point in the future EDIT: here it is https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdata/comments/6640ru/place_datasets_april_fools_2017/

Could we get that with anonymized(or not) usernames?  
Getting the usernames (anonymized or not - though I doubt they'd release the actual usernames) would be cool. It would be fascinating data to comb through. You could see certain users that would purposely destroy things. You could probably weed out single mistakes versus systemic trolls. Having the users not anonymized would be cool too - you could see if their behavior on place was similar to their behavior on reddit posts/comments. But that's probably why they'd be prone to anonymize it.  
Could we get that with anonymized(or not) usernames?  
I don't think there's any point in anonymizing the usernames since they were available and collected while place was running.  Trying to anonymize them now would be like trying to put a genie back in a bottle.

Once in the message queue, they are cast into their true shape - application logs - in our low-level wrapper. Finally, they are reshaped, coloured and displayed using vector graphics, so that no matter how deep the stack or how hot the cache, you can be sure your hand-crafted flame graph is up to snuff.

I enjoyed this, but I'm curious about one thing.  Sometimes my browser didn't get updates.  I once worked for an hour on a section, only to load it in another browser and find out that I was changing the wrong tiles because I had a outdated picture in the browser I was using.  I finally checked another browser because I was surprised at my progress (which had previously been stymied by others reversing my work.) Were you aware of that happening, or that it was possible?  
Due to the nature of the project (launch all at once with minimal testing) we weren't able to find all the bugs in advance, and once we did launch it was dangerous to fix bugs, especially ones that were only effecting a small number of users.

i'm guessing bots were mainly responsible for the more elaborate images like the mona lisa and such.  
If you watch a place timelapse you'll see two Mona Lisa's emerging at the same time.  The one on the left being drawn by users and the one on the right by a single user running a script controlling a large group of bots. What is telling is that the human drawn one starts with the face (the collaborators decided this would be the best way to get others interested in the project).  The one being drawn by bots prints pixel-by-pixel in a very obvious fashion.  Details like this make me love these projects.  
What's interesting is how poorly the bot defended it's art. Since it was doing line by line, left to right it probably checked for pixels that had been overwritten in the same fashion and replaced them. Which means with enough people the bot would just get stuck repairing the top most part. The one on the left is less worried about an individual pixel and more worried about recognizable features. This, IMO, is a more effective defense as it would allow the users to get large features with minor defacing on the canvas then worry about the smaller, less impactful parts.

Okay, it's kind of tangential but I have to say this, all that you guys wrote on the blog looks so overwhelming to me. I am a CS major, I'll graduate next year but I could barely understand anything. I am just scared I mightn't be good for programming and stuff when I see crazy stuff like this. When do you learn this, during work? How hard are these things to learn and how does the intuition come?   
I always get pretty intimidated at the start of a project, particularly when it seems like it's big and I'm not sure how to do it from the get go. That's OK though. Just tear it apart into smaller pieces and see if you can make sense of them and then come back and look at how it all fits together after a bit of that tactical work. I think you'll surprise yourself with what you can do when you stop being daunted by the overall project and just solve some problems. In the end, just remember this: no one knows what they're doing and everything in engineering is tradeoffs. Have fun!

EXACTLY THIS.  There's still a lot of stuff on /r/programming that flies over my head, after being a programmer for nearly 20 years.  This write up makes perfect sense to me, though, because it deals with tech I use every day -- redis, Node, HTML5, caches, and sockets.  Experience helps a bunch. I've given this talk to a lot of beginner programmers:  When you first start out somewhere, you are going to think you're the dumbest one there, and everyone is light-years ahead of you.  It still happens to me.  But you keep grinding at it, until you understand it all.  One day in a meeting, you'll look at all your co-workers and say, "Wait... you guys are a dumb as I am!"

 This was a team project so no one needed to know or understand everything. Having good coworkers or other people you can learn from and get help from is extremely valuable. I'm constantly learning new things and encountering systems or concepts that I don't understand. Not knowing things is fine and it's better to recognize you don't know something and try to learn than it is to pretend you know everything. Most things you can learn through experience. Web applications can be complex systems, but they're not rocket science and if you try to keep things simple and boring you'll do well.   
This makes me want a job in a true dev environment so bad. I started learning HTML/CSS about 9 months ago to transition out of a career in sales. Wound up starting a construction materials company with an old boss and took on the responsibility of managing our technology. It's lonely being a brand new dev in a good old boy industry like this. I always get so jealous and day dreamy when I read accounts like yours. Just to be in an environment where there were people with experience to learn from sounds so awesome.  
I'm in this positionas well. Being the only dev in a workplace can have its benefits. One of the major downsides is you are never really sure if what you're doing is actually good. Everyone seems pretty pleased because it works, but I'm always afraid of running into another developer who will look at it tell me it's garbage.

 EFF  They‚Äôre great, hats off to them. But nevertheless, they‚Äôre a focused on the US which makes them less of a choice for Europe. We‚Äôd need an equivalent organization that understands local law and jurisdictions, cooperating on the level of at least the entire EU.

I wish there was a large and strong international white hat/it security institution that could back this kid up. He did the right thing. Found a flaw, verified it and reported it. We need to throw our weight in and cover each other when someone gets targeted like this, just because some fucking ego was scuffed.

We need laws that cover this shit. If you find and report a vulnerability properly you can't be sued or held liable for damages, on the other hand you are not allowed to disclose your findings to the general public or a 3rd party during a 30 day period.  
I'd go further and have a "pay to delay" schedule that doubles every 30 days.  Want to delay disclosure 30 more days?  No problem: That'll be a $500 fee paid to the discoverer.  30 more days?  $1000.  30 more days?  $2000.  Until they stop paying to avoid disclosure. Multiple parties discovered the same vulnerability?  Well, get ready to pay them all every 30 days after they disclosed it to you according to the fee schedule! People could and should make a living doing this sort of thing.  
Now that would just be an exploit. One needs only secretly share that information with numerous contacts and have them all nail the company with the "pay to delay" charge. Those contacts would of course either pay the original party a cut of what the first payment would be, or they'd agree to pay an increasing cut each 30 days until the vulnerability is disclosed.

That sounds like literal extortion. I can see what you're going for, but that's still extortion. At the very least give companies like 30-60 days for free, FFS.

Why did he even need to report it?  Is using browser tools to edit values even hacking at all? I'm not sure he did ANYTHING illegal.   
Depending on the letter of the law, there's a significant case to be made for theft, fraud, etc. It doesn't matter that he contacted them and had them cancel his pass; the fact that he obtained the pass in the first place could be considered an illegal act. To use an analogy to brick-and-mortar stores, imagine if a shop had an entry door and an exit door, and only set up anti-theft devices at the exit door. If you grab an item, then walk out the entry door without paying for it, it could legally be considered shoplifting, even if you immediately walk back in to give the item back and tell them their security sucks. It would be a dick move for them to call the police, and even more of a dick move for the police to arrest you and the courts to press charges, but it would all be within the letter of the law (in our hypothetical situation where the law is written that way).  
I think your analogy is flawed. It's more like he checked out told the cashier it was $.50 instead of $30 and the cashier said yup that's correct and let him walk out the front door. It's not his fault they didn't say no it's $30.

I know a similar case in Spain Basically, Sevilla Transport had an APP with schedule's information. The app was awful as hell, so a young student decides create his own app. His app was a complete success, beating the original. Just contrast the difference at the picture of below:  https://i.blogs.es/e9d80e/tumblr_inline_okoz72fiyj1qbxxsf_540/1366_2000.png (left: original, right: made by the student).   Sevilla transport authority was ashamed by a young boy! That couldn't happen, so they sue criminal charges against him: Hacking security measures, plagiarism... These charges didn't have any fucking sense, but the author didn't want take the risk for a free app. So he deleted it of the market place.

Given how things work in Spain, I would bet that the government of Sevilla sub-contracted a shitty contractor company (C√°rnicas or Meat Grinders due the high turnover and burnout rates and low prices and salaries) to do the work and they delivered the minimal shitty available app possible. They wouldn't offer him a job  because, first, they probably weren't even hiring on the first place, second, the contracting company most probably finished the contract after delivering (Or maybe after delivering, providing a bit of support and had their contract removed after other shitty contractor company bid less money for the maintenance), and third, either the contracting company wasn't hiring people with no degree or just they weren't interested in someone who actually had technical knowledge.

That's not just Spain, that's software contracting in general, both public and private sectors.

Whats with all public transport companies?  A friend of mine created the an app for the public transport in Sofia, Bulgaria. The first on the market.  The transport company had only an unusable web interface. When they head about it, they send cease and desist letter. It did not work so they tried to buy the app. It's MIT project on github, so that did not work to.   At the end they just added a captcha to the web interface.

Yes.

I'm using a free Android app named "Offi" developed by a long-time local Android enthusiast here in Berlin. Over the course of several years, he has extended the app from supporting primarily Berlin to a vast amount of networks all over Germany, Europe and the world. It is absolutely comprehensive, and feature-rich, and still, there are several public transportation companies that have contacted him not to include them in the app and not to consume their APIs. So sad.  
If you don't want me to consume your api then you need to secure it with api keys. That's like putting up a billboard that tells people not to read it.

Fucking dinosaurs. Probably think that if Offi accesses their data, then it'll "have" all their data, and they won't "have it" any more.  
From bash.org: <NES> lol <NES> I download something from Napster <NES> And the same guy I downloaded it from starts      downloading it from me when I'm done <NES> I message him and say "What are you doing?      I just got that from you" <NES> "getting my song back fucker"  (I hope the link is right. bash.org is blocked at my workplace.)

I'm usually in favor of responsible disclosure, but holy shit:  the system stored the passwords in clear text and it emailed it to you if you asked for a password reminder.... someone found out that the admin password was adminadmin and managed to log in using that.... He just used the developer tools in the browser, that everybody has access to, saw that the price was being sent back to the server when he was about to make a purchase, and tried if he could change it....   
There's always one developer on the team who doesn't care about this sort of thing, and the others have to pick up after them and make sure everything is done properly. This must be what happens when everyone on the team is the bad developer.  
I'd guess although they didn't have the understanding to know better, they just implemented what management asked for, including taking the short-cuts management demanded.

Someone finding the admin password is beyond bad, but that in combination to passwords being plain text? I sincerely hope most people realized how awful that site was quickly and refused to use it.

 they earlier talked about how this was not ethical hacking because no one asked the guy to do it  That's not what "ethical hacking" means.  
For some, ethical hacking requires agreement with the target. This is to avoid risking perturbations of the service, etc. during the hacking attempt. As for the law (in most countries), it's a requirement. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security)#Legality_in_the_UK  Edit: playing devil's advocate, here's some reason that are pro-"don't hack if your target doesn't agree to be hacked":  as said, the hacker could disturb the service during his/her hack. And even cause huge damage (like, wiping or corrupting the production database). Even if no actual damage occur, even if the hack failed, the company may spend a large amount of worker-time (thus money) to analyze afterwards the attack and makes sure no damage was done (they will likely not know the attacker was a white hat, nor the extend of the hack) any lawsuit against someone trying to intrude your network would become useless. "I was trying to see if it could be hacked!" said the nephew of your competitor. it could happen at the wrong time, like right before a migration to a safer system. "Ok, you've shown previous system was terrible at security, but we were in the middle of changing it. Now the new system is up and running, we would have prefer this new system to be pen-tested". if a hacker manage to penetrate a system containing sensitive data (like SSN, medical records), you would still have someone getting unauthorized access to sensitive data - which is bad in itself.   Ofc there are good things about having hacker trying to penetrate networks - it forced the hands of bad actors, or at least expose them. But we need to weight the pro and the cons. Or make another law altogether, like "any system that matches those criteria [public sensitive data, yadda yadda] needs to host honey pots that mimics their internals for public target practice" (ofc, problem would be the cost due to additional planning/world/infrastructure).  
Probably in the dictionary there can be room for two distinct phrases "ethical hacking" and "legal hacking".

Edit: Basicly a tech guy found a vuln in a gov site(created and maintained by third party) , that allowed ssn lookup (also automated lookup / person and name). The guy reported it to the firm gov, which said it was not a vuln. Basicly dismissing it.  He then contacted the press, which brought the story.  The following days, the firm, which has the bug, contacted the tech guy's boss and told that his employee had hacked them and asked if they were aware. After that, they filed a report for hacking. Poor tech guy.  All he did was finding a severe bug, report it correctly, then gets a report.  So yeah. Atleast theres that.....

Which is why I'd never report bugs to a company without a public bounty program. It means they do not give a fuck about security and will instead try to silence you by any means necessary. Better get that bounty on the dark & high seas.  
I have a couple of rules for things like this that I think are pretty reasonable:  Is it a bug in open source software (free or not)?  Disclose it right away (using secure methods if possible).  Fix it too if possible. Is it a bug in closed, proprietary software?  If they don't have a bounty I just put it in "my file" (I have a special place where I store vulnerabilities and knowledge of them). Is it Sony, Comcast, or Verizon?  They can suck it.  Start with loud, public disclosure because... Fuck them.  I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if it turned out they were funding ISIS, "just to spread the evil."   
I get Comcast and Verizon, but what has Sony done? They make pretty good TVs and have some good games on their console but I don't know much else about them.

Well, that tears it. If I find a vulnerability in someone's system, I won't even try to warn them about it, I'll just abuse the hell out of it. That way I can go to jail content in that I at least wronged someone with my unauthorized information system access.

Well, my guess is that they aren't.  They are business man and accountants.  The outsourced the project (or at least parts of it) to the company who was willing to do it the cheapest.

This dumpster fire took them 4 years and 9 million EUR??? What. The. Fuck.  
This dumpster fire took them 4 years and 9 million EUR??? What. The. Fuck.  
Hey, noob programmer here: I'll take the 9 million and produce a better app. I'll have it done when I'm finished with my degree in 3 years.  
You're probably far along enough now to do it in a weekend or two

That was my exact reaction. I could build the system myself in 4-6 months.  Give me a few engineers and I'll have a beta in one. ...And I would have a system much more hardened than theirs...  
I built my web development business up a few years ago and started pitching for a few small government RFPs; most of the time I couldn't come up with quotes high enough to be considered!  Like, I was gonna go in with ¬£10k, making a healthy profit, and the budget range they were asking for was ¬£50k-¬£150k.  Most of the jobs went to big companies who then immediately sub-contracted it out after pocketing the majority of the cash.

In my city a student found a vulnerability on the bus tickets (they use NFC)  that basically let you go for unlimited travels, he was awarded a prize.  
Was that prize unlimited travel?

The people responsible for the ticket system should be arrested. Releasing such a insecure leaky cobbled together program shows the disrespect for consumers, they should've known better.   
This just in: disrespect is now illegal. This is one of the cases where even I think the market will solve it.  
There is no free market on public transport. At worst you end up with a monopoly, at best with a oligopoly. Very few companies in this world have the scope and capital to disrupt existing public transportation networks of busses, trams, and possibly underground trains.  
Transportation is usually publicly run because it is run at a loss with public subsidy making up the gap. That's not exactly something private companies are clamoring to get into.

The title is completely overblown. What actually happened is much, much simpler:  And a week later the news broke out that he was taken from his home by the police in the early morning and taken to custody. (He was released after a few hours.)  Literally, the police came to question him because there was a massive public outcry and they wanted to ensure that there wasn't anything nefarious going on. He wasn't "arrested", he wasn't even detained, and he certainly hasn't been charged with a crime.  Are we really getting up in arms over completely non-technically literate police officers doing their basic due diligence?

A single person answered 76k questions about SQL on StackOverflow. Averaging 22.8 answers per day, every day, for the past 8.6 years.
I picture this individual getting back home from a full day of work at a boutique furniture store, putting a vinyl of Earth Wind and Fire on, pouring themselves a full glass of wine, and just fucking going at answering SQL questions until the early hours.  
The man is the head of an analytics department at the New York Times, a professor at Columbia, and owns an analytics consulting company. He fits that profile to a tee.  
He also literally wrote a book on SQL. Several of them, actually. And on datamining as well. https://www.amazon.com/s?rh=p_27%3AGordon+S.+Linoff&ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1  
I mean it sounds like his contributions to SO basically comprise a couple books by themselves.

Did he write any sequels?

At least StackOverflow gives you a box of stuff when you reach a certain point.  
And some amount of geek cred that's semi-useful for work.  
As someone in the top 2% who has been interviewing for jobs recently, I can say it's really worthless. The best I got was a "that's impressive! Good for you man" from an interviewer. Most of the other ones didn't even check my profile I think, although I promote it in my resume. But the worst is when the interviewer asks during 30 minutes the most basic shits about the language for which I answered 400 questions. Makes me feel like I just wasted my time.

Conversely, too high an amount of karma probably indicates you're not that useful at work.

Also privileges. Things like closing questions and marking questions as duplicates whenever you want.

Here is his blog post on his StackOverflow activity: http://blog.data-miners.com/2014/08/an-achievement-on-stack-overflow.html "For a few months, I sporadically answered questions.  Then, in the first week of May, my Mom's younger brother passed away.  That meant lots of time hanging around family, planning the funeral, and the like.  Answering questions on Stack Overflow turned out to be a good way to get away from things.  So, I became more intent."  
 So, I became more intent.  There's something about this that hits me just right. I want to put it in the mouth of a Big Bad in a dnd campaign or something

Most of What You Read on the Internet is Written by Insane People  The largest subs see from 1% to 3% of uniques comment per month. So Reddit consists of 97-99% of users rarely contributing to the discussion, just passively consuming the content generated by the other 1-3%. This is a pretty consistent trend in Internet communities and is known as the 1% rule. But there's more, because not all the users who post do so with the same frequency. The 1% rule is of course just another way of saying that the distribution of contributions follows a Power Law Distribution, which means that the level of inequality gets more drastic as you look at smaller subsets of users.  Inequalities are also found on Wikipedia, where more than 99% of users are lurkers. According to Wikipedia's "about" page, it has only 68,000 active contributors, which is 0.2% of the 32 million unique visitors it has in the U.S. alone. Wikipedia's most active 1,000 people ‚Äî 0.003% of its users ‚Äî contribute about two-thirds of the site's edits. Wikipedia is thus even more skewed than blogs, with a 99.8‚Äì0.2‚Äì0.003 rule.    I found one [Amazon] reviewer with 20.8k reviews since 2011. That's just under 3,000 reviews per year, which comes out to around 8 per day. This man has written an average of 8 reviews on Amazon per day, all of the ones I see about books, every day for seven years. I thought it might be some bot account writing fake reviews in exchange for money, but if it is then it's a really good bot because Grady Harp is a real person whose job matches that account's description. And my skimming of some reviews looked like they were all relevant to the book, and he has the "verified purchase" tag on all of them, which also means he's probably actually reading them. The only explanation for this behavior is that he is insane. I mean, normal people don't do that. We read maybe 20 books a year, tops, and we probably don't write reviews on Amazon for all of them. There has to be something wrong with this guy. He's less prominent now, but YouTube power-user Justin Y. had a top comment on pretty much every video you clicked on for like a year. He says he spends 1-3 hours per day commenting on YouTube, finds videos by looking at the statistics section of the site to see which are spiking in popularity, and comments on a lot of videos without watching them. Maybe he's not quite insane, but he's clearly interacting the site in a way that's different than most people, essentially optimizing for comment likes. If you read reviews on Amazon, you're mostly reading reviews written by people like Grady Harp. If you read Wikipedia, you're mostly reading articles written by people like Justin Knapp. If you watch Twitch streamers, you're mostly watching people like Tyler Blevins. And if you read YouTube comments, you're mostly reading comments written by people like Justin Young. If you consume any content on the Internet, you're mostly consuming content created by people who for some reason spend most of their time and energy creating content on the Internet. And those people clearly differ from the general population in important ways.   
If you posted this comment does that make you an insane person?

 If you read Wikipedia, you're mostly reading articles written by people like..  One note on Wikipedia is that a lot of edits are semi-automated and samey, like someone reverting vandalism, fixing grammar or renaming categories. So it looks way more disproportionate than it is. You could revert 1000 vandals in a day and contribute "0 content" by that measure.  
Apparently theres (sort of) "official" bots.  Met a guy who was making one to look for some specific kind of formatting  error.  Apparently there's some kind of vetting process before such bots are allowed join the ranks.

SO has a system setup that discourages contribution from new users; not directly, not explicitly, but it's there. If you can get yourself a few thousand "points" without attracting the attention of mods or "trusted users" then you might be okay, but even then you're still on thin ice until you reach 20K. I've never tried contributing to Wikipedia, so can't speak to their system, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's similarly discouraging for new contributors.  
 I've never tried contributing to Wikipedia, so can't speak to their system, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's similarly discouraging for new contributors.  Oh, it has to be infinitely worse. Here's an actual quote from one of the Wiki admins:  ‚Äú‚Ä¶inclusionism generally is toxic. It lets a huge volume of garbage pile up. Deletionism just takes out the trash. We did it with damn Pokemon, and we‚Äôll eventually do it with junk football ‚Äòbiographies‚Äô, with ‚Äòfootball‚Äô in the sense of American and otherwise. We‚Äôll sooner or later get it done with ‚Äòpopulated places‚Äô and the like too.‚Äù   Here's a text by former admin (different one), In Defense of Inclusionism:  Wikipedia is declining, fundamentally, because of its increasingly narrow attitude as to what are acceptable topics and to what depth those topics can be explored, combined with a narrowed attitude as to what are acceptable sources, where academic & media coverage trumps any consideration of other factors. This discourages contributors‚Äîthe prerequisite for any content whatsoever‚Äîand cuts off growth; perversely, the lack of contributors becomes its own excuse for discouraging more contribution (since who will maintain it?), a self-fulfilling norm (we focus on quality over quantity here!) and drives away those with dissenting views, since unsurprisingly those who advocate more content tend to also contribute content and be driven away when their content is. One bad editor can destroy in seconds what took many years to create. The inclusionists founded Wikipedia, but the deletionists froze it. in the early days you could have things like articles on each chapter of Atlas Shrugged or each Pokemon. Even if you personally did not like Objectivism or Pokemon, you knew that you could go into just as much detail about the topics you liked best‚ÄîWikipedia was not paper! We talked idealistically about how Wikipedia could become an encyclopedia of specialist encyclopedias, the superset of encyclopedias. ‚Äúwould you expect to see a Bulbasaur article in a Pokemon encyclopedia? yes? then let‚Äôs have a Bulbasaur article‚Äù. The potential was that Wikipedia would be the summary of the Internet and books/‚Äãmedia. But now Wikipedia‚Äôs narrowing focus means, only some of what is worth knowing, about some topics. Respectable topics. Mainstream topics. Unimpeachably Encyclopedic topics.    I am not excited or interested in such a parochial project which excludes so many of my interests, which does not want me to go into great depth about even the interests it deems meritorious‚Äîand a great many other people are not excited either, especially as they begin to realize that even if you navigate the culture correctly and get your material into Wikipedia, there is far from any guarantee that your contributions will be respected, not deleted, and improved. For the amateurs and also experts who wrote wikipedia, why would they want to contribute to some place that doesn‚Äôt want them? But who really cares about what some nerds like? What matters is Notability with a capital N, and the fact that our feelings were hurt by some Wikigroaning!

 inclusionism generally is toxic. It lets a huge volume of garbage pile up. Deletionism just takes out the trash. We did it with damn Pokemon, and we‚Äôll eventually do it with junk football ‚Äòbiographies‚Äô, with ‚Äòfootball‚Äô in the sense of American and otherwise. We‚Äôll sooner or later get it done with ‚Äòpopulated places‚Äô and the like too.‚Äù  Wrestling articles has to be on that list to pare down, too.  
 I've never tried contributing to Wikipedia, so can't speak to their system, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's similarly discouraging for new contributors.  Oh, it has to be infinitely worse. Here's an actual quote from one of the Wiki admins:  ‚Äú‚Ä¶inclusionism generally is toxic. It lets a huge volume of garbage pile up. Deletionism just takes out the trash. We did it with damn Pokemon, and we‚Äôll eventually do it with junk football ‚Äòbiographies‚Äô, with ‚Äòfootball‚Äô in the sense of American and otherwise. We‚Äôll sooner or later get it done with ‚Äòpopulated places‚Äô and the like too.‚Äù   Here's a text by former admin (different one), In Defense of Inclusionism:  Wikipedia is declining, fundamentally, because of its increasingly narrow attitude as to what are acceptable topics and to what depth those topics can be explored, combined with a narrowed attitude as to what are acceptable sources, where academic & media coverage trumps any consideration of other factors. This discourages contributors‚Äîthe prerequisite for any content whatsoever‚Äîand cuts off growth; perversely, the lack of contributors becomes its own excuse for discouraging more contribution (since who will maintain it?), a self-fulfilling norm (we focus on quality over quantity here!) and drives away those with dissenting views, since unsurprisingly those who advocate more content tend to also contribute content and be driven away when their content is. One bad editor can destroy in seconds what took many years to create. The inclusionists founded Wikipedia, but the deletionists froze it. in the early days you could have things like articles on each chapter of Atlas Shrugged or each Pokemon. Even if you personally did not like Objectivism or Pokemon, you knew that you could go into just as much detail about the topics you liked best‚ÄîWikipedia was not paper! We talked idealistically about how Wikipedia could become an encyclopedia of specialist encyclopedias, the superset of encyclopedias. ‚Äúwould you expect to see a Bulbasaur article in a Pokemon encyclopedia? yes? then let‚Äôs have a Bulbasaur article‚Äù. The potential was that Wikipedia would be the summary of the Internet and books/‚Äãmedia. But now Wikipedia‚Äôs narrowing focus means, only some of what is worth knowing, about some topics. Respectable topics. Mainstream topics. Unimpeachably Encyclopedic topics.    I am not excited or interested in such a parochial project which excludes so many of my interests, which does not want me to go into great depth about even the interests it deems meritorious‚Äîand a great many other people are not excited either, especially as they begin to realize that even if you navigate the culture correctly and get your material into Wikipedia, there is far from any guarantee that your contributions will be respected, not deleted, and improved. For the amateurs and also experts who wrote wikipedia, why would they want to contribute to some place that doesn‚Äôt want them? But who really cares about what some nerds like? What matters is Notability with a capital N, and the fact that our feelings were hurt by some Wikigroaning! After all, clearly the proper way to respond to the observation that Lightsaber combat was longer than Sabre is to delete its contents and have people read the short, scrawny‚Äîbut serious!‚ÄîLightsaber article instead. If it doesn‚Äôt appear in Encarta or Encyclopedia Britannica, or isn‚Äôt treated at the same (proportional) length, then it must go!   
Ah yeah back in the day I contributed massively to Zoids entries on Wikipedia, cleaning them up, adding photos etc. Then one day the notability police came in a set them all up for deletion. The various fan wikis are way more wild west, I miss when Wikipedia could have an article for every proper noun  
Most of What You Read on the Internet is Written by Insane People  The largest subs see from 1% to 3% of uniques comment per month. So Reddit consists of 97-99% of users rarely contributing to the discussion, just passively consuming the content generated by the other 1-3%. This is a pretty consistent trend in Internet communities and is known as the 1% rule. But there's more, because not all the users who post do so with the same frequency. The 1% rule is of course just another way of saying that the distribution of contributions follows a Power Law Distribution, which means that the level of inequality gets more drastic as you look at smaller subsets of users.  Inequalities are also found on Wikipedia, where more than 99% of users are lurkers. According to Wikipedia's "about" page, it has only 68,000 active contributors, which is 0.2% of the 32 million unique visitors it has in the U.S. alone. Wikipedia's most active 1,000 people ‚Äî 0.003% of its users ‚Äî contribute about two-thirds of the site's edits. Wikipedia is thus even more skewed than blogs, with a 99.8‚Äì0.2‚Äì0.003 rule.    I found one [Amazon] reviewer with 20.8k reviews since 2011. That's just under 3,000 reviews per year, which comes out to around 8 per day. This man has written an average of 8 reviews on Amazon per day, all of the ones I see about books, every day for seven years. I thought it might be some bot account writing fake reviews in exchange for money, but if it is then it's a really good bot because Grady Harp is a real person whose job matches that account's description. And my skimming of some reviews looked like they were all relevant to the book, and he has the "verified purchase" tag on all of them, which also means he's probably actually reading them. The only explanation for this behavior is that he is insane. I mean, normal people don't do that. We read maybe 20 books a year, tops, and we probably don't write reviews on Amazon for all of them. There has to be something wrong with this guy. He's less prominent now, but YouTube power-user Justin Y. had a top comment on pretty much every video you clicked on for like a year. He says he spends 1-3 hours per day commenting on YouTube, finds videos by looking at the statistics section of the site to see which are spiking in popularity, and comments on a lot of videos without watching them. Maybe he's not quite insane, but he's clearly interacting the site in a way that's different than most people, essentially optimizing for comment likes. If you read reviews on Amazon, you're mostly reading reviews written by people like Grady Harp. If you read Wikipedia, you're mostly reading articles written by people like Justin Knapp. If you watch Twitch streamers, you're mostly watching people like Tyler Blevins. And if you read YouTube comments, you're mostly reading comments written by people like Justin Young. If you consume any content on the Internet, you're mostly consuming content created by people who for some reason spend most of their time and energy creating content on the Internet. And those people clearly differ from the general population in important ways.   
I had to look at Grady Harp's profile since reading and reviewing 8 books per day on average seems unsustainable. Some of his reviews feel fairly boilerplate and feel like he's selling them (they are nearly all five stars) but the sheer volume is impressive.

I was offered a SQL developer job last year, and I considered just taking it, spending 6 months converting everything to EF without anybody knowing, and then just sitting back, collecting a paycheck. But they required being in office. During a pandemic. A guy on my LinkedIn was offered the job after me and left after like 3 months.

Severe flaw in WPA2 protocol leaves Wi-Fi traffic open to eavesdropping
Whenever this happens (like with heartbleed), I always wonder how long someone else has known and taken advantage of it.  
 Whenever this happens (like with heartbleed), I always wonder how long someone else has known and taken advantage of it.  Given the vast amount of mathematicians & security researchers employed by the NSA, it's hard to imagine they haven't known it for quite some time. The same probably applies to russian & chinese agencies...  
Absolutely this has been known by at least one global intelligence agency. However, using it carelessly poses the risk of an extremely valuable resource being burnt. It would likely be handled with the utmost‚Äôs of care and not in situations where the value of data it could glean would outweigh the risk of it being detected and burnt. In other words, it‚Äôs entirely unlikely that it was used to spy on your Yahoo Answers replies at the airport.  
Especially when they could probably just ask the people who run the airport wifi to let them spy on your Yahoo Answers replies.

This attitude frustrates me. Do they employ vastly more mathematicians and security researchers than the open research community? I doubt it.  While it is very likely that they know about many vulnerabilities that we don‚Äôt, it is much less likely that they have advance knowledge of any particular vulnerability. There are going to be ones they already knew about, but there are also going for be ones that they didn‚Äôt.  Now, maybe you can make a case for why this particular vulnerability probably would have been discovered by these agencies prior to now. But what you‚Äôre saying now amounts to spooky NSA with their spooky mathematicians knows everything. It‚Äôs not helpful.

Not only do they hire a huge number of mathematicians, they hire he best that they can find. There is also a large difference between NSA researchers and lab researchers: the NSA pays better. These NSA researchers exist solely to crack common systems and build exploit programs. From some of the program leaks, we know that they devise 0-day attacks long before anyone knows that there's a problem

Tinfoil spoiler: There's even the idea that flaws were put intentionally. Or even more subtle, by suggesting a certain feature, hoping for an anticipated flaw.  
That's not just an idea. It's proven fact with some tech and app 'features' like with Skype once MS bought it.

 The return of cc jacking from big box businesses is about to return in a major way tho.  ... elaborate?  
Big credit card breaches from wardriving.. aka driving around with a laptop and wifi toolkits. Back when WEP first became vulnerable a lot of retailers were targeted and tons of credit cards were compromised.  All that cooled down quite a bit when everyone switched to wpa2.. With this coming out and PCI compliance still a joke I'll bet we see a return to the days of massive cc dumps.

Severe flaw in WPA2 protocol leaves Wi-Fi traffic open to eavesdropping
Will be interesting to see the complexity required to perform this attack. A hole this wide in WPA2 would have serious security ramifications for almost all of us who connect to home and many commercial WiFi routers.   
The paper paints a pretty straight forward description of 'how' to implement all the various key re-installation attacks, including flow diagrams of the steps involved. The biggest 'hurdle' is intercepting wifi messages intended for clients s.t. you can respond, preventing them from doing so - this requires specialised equipment (or some good positioning / timing). To quote their conclusion section (emphasis mine):  These attacks do not violate the security properties of the formal proofs, but highlight limitations of the models employed by them. In particular, the models do not specify when a key should be installed for usage by the data-confidentiality protocol. Additionally, we showed that the PeerKey and fast BSS transition handshake are vulnerable to key reinstallation attacks. All Wi-Fi clients we tested were vulnerable to our attack against the group key handshake. This enables an adversary to replay broadcast and multicast frames. When the 4-way or fast BSS transition handshake is attacked, the precise impact depends on the data-confidentiality protocol being used. In all cases though, it is possible to decrypt frames and thus hijack TCP connections. This enables the injection of data into unencrypted HTTP connections. Moreover, against Android 6.0 our attack triggered the installation of an all-zero key, completely voiding any security guarantees. Rather worryingly, our key reinstallation attack even occurs spontaneously if certain handshake messages are lost due to background noise. This means that under certain conditions, implementations are reusing nonces without an adversary being present.   
I'd have emphasised the following passage, that suggests that by flooding the target's device so that it misses handshake messages, the attacker could "brute force" his way into having the attack trigger. IIRC, you can arbitrarily disconnect a client from an AP, making this even more feasible.  Rather worryingly, our key reinstallation attack even occurs spontaneously if certain handshake messages are lost due to background noise. This means that under certain conditions, implementations are reusing nonces without an adversary being present.   
Will be interesting to see the complexity required to perform this attack. A hole this wide in WPA2 would have serious security ramifications for almost all of us who connect to home and many commercial WiFi routers.

Doesn't HSTS solve this?  
Personal gripe with HSTS: when using hotel/airport wifi, frequently what is required is that you access any webpage (e.g. google), it then redirects you to a login page, and then after you login you can then use the hotel wifi (android handles this better than windows - it automatically prompts you to the login page). With HSTS, I can no longer access any webpage - I have to find one without HSTS (moved from google to cnn, and then cnn to aljazeera). As HSTS becomes more commonplace, finding a login page will be harder. Someone with more tech chops than me recommended that I visit 1.1.1.1, which should always redirect to the portal as captive portal setup should redirect anything that's not in the client's dns resolver cache. So far that has solved my problem.

 After the WPA side-channel attacks I decided to go without Wi-Fi.  Do you honestly think the odds of someone with the necessary skills targeting your Wi-Fi signal are that high?  What would they even have to gain?  You can buy stolen identities online by the hundreds. 99% of the reason to secure home Wi-Fi is to keep your neighbors from freeloading.  No one is driving around cracking home Wi-Fi signals, there's just too little to gain.  
Except people were totally doing that during the WEP heydays. If the WPA exploit is easy and fast to execute, there will be a resurgence here

It's not about them targeting his wifi. It's about them having the potential to target anyone's wifi. From an individual perspective, he's better off staying ahead of the pack, security-wise. If the exploit gains widespread use, he'll be safe. It's generally easier to exploit older security, and there's generally a better return on targeting the status quo, rather than the bleeding edge. From a communal perspective, the people who do have things to hide are better off if they're not the only ones practicing good security. Otherwise good security only serves to draw attention to dissidents. Perhaps most importantly, people enjoy optimising. Some people optimise athleticism and others optimise material possessions. Others optimise their wifi connections. The journey is the destination.

 A hole this wide in WPA2 would have serious security ramifications for almost all of us who connect to home and many commercial WiFi routers  I may be obtuse here, but what security ramifications are there? Modern Internet users generally are using protocols that have already assumed the lower-layer protocols are completely insecure. HTTPS, ssh, IMAPS, etc., none of them would be affected. There may still be some people there using HTTP, but that's becoming rarer, and no one's using it for anything serious. DNS is about all I can think of that's not secure any more, but again, the application layers are already assuming that DNS is insecure.

Severe flaw in WPA2 protocol leaves Wi-Fi traffic open to eavesdropping
Is there any alternative methods we can use now? Instead of WPA?  
Nope. Also the other responses to you are misunderstanding the impact of this.  Compromising WPA2 might be considered the equivalent of compromising your Ethernet cable.   It‚Äôs already game over in that case - maybe you‚Äôre safe if you stick to using a well-implemented VPN, but you still have a bad guy on your network, a bad guy capable of spoofing ARP, manipulating your DNS, and MITMing everything you do, not to mention whatever he‚Äôs using your connectivity for.  
Sorry for being stupid but... this only applies to wireless networks, right? Like, it's okay if you use an ethernet cable?

And if it's that bad and can't be patched in software we are in for a world of hurt. The Wi-Fi Alliance would have to release a successor, which in itself could take quite some time and then every single WiFi appliance would have to be replaced. And the upgrade from WEP to WPA was easy in comparison to what we would have to do today. In 2004 the only things who would exclusively use WEP would be Laptops, some Desktops, a few PDAs and a single mobile gaming console, and at least Laptops and Desktops were easy to upgrade. Today everything but the kitchen sink has Wi-Fi built-in and it can't be upgraded in nearly all of those devices   
Think about all those millions of embedded/IoT devices that never get updated and have cheap and crappy wifi controllers. Hopefully there‚Äôll be a backwards compatible solution that requires no action by clients.  
Is there any alternative methods we can use now? Instead of WPA?  
Rely on secure protocols: https or as said in the article use a vpn provider (a secure one). Therefore the data sent is encrypted anyway and your wifi security doens't matter much. Bigger problem for home use is that your network could be abused for malicious purposes and you get blamed for them. It' snot like a hacker cares about your family photos.  
But there's no alternative to WPA? As far as routers go  
ethernet cables, unfortunately  
Is there any alternative methods we can use now? Instead of WPA?  
Yeah, run a cat5 cable to your laptop like an insane person.  
let's be sensible here, you need at LEASt cat6 to be secure.

make sure you are using https there are also vpns, but know your vpn well, don't just grab anything there are "vpn"s out there that are which are scammy/ outright malicious/ fake/ misconfigured  
Bad advice. There are soooooo many other TCP and UDP protocols that don't have a HTTP equivalent. So saying "just use HTTPS" is like saying "Just always drive with a tank". But people also drive a roller, bike, surf board, bus, train, airplane and whatnot.  
this is the average user we're talking about the issue is banking, identity-heavy sites like facebook, etc. yeah you have to encrypt SMTP too but a lot of people are just doing email through the browser and who really cares if someone is messing with your gaming sessions (in terms of life-destroying intrusions)  
Severe flaw in WPA2 protocol leaves Wi-Fi traffic open to eavesdropping
From the FAQs on https://www.krackattacks.com/  What if there are no security updates for my router? Our main attack is against the 4-way handshake, and does not exploit access points, but instead targets clients. So it might be that your router does not require security updates. We strongly advise you to contact your vendor for more details. In general though, you can try to mitigate attacks against routers and access points by disabling client functionality (which is for example used in repeater modes) and disabling 802.11r (fast roaming). For ordinary home users, your priority should be updating clients such as laptops and smartphones.  So it looks like patching only the clients (laptops/smartphones) could be enough?

Not just eavesdropping:  The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities includes decryption, packet replay, TCP connection hijacking, HTTP content injection, and others.   Basically WPA is just as 'bad' as WEP now.  These are the CVE-2017-identifiers registered for the exploits 13077, 13078, 13079, 13080, 13081, 13082, 13084, 13086, 13087, 13088. Yes. 10 of them. It looks like this is actually a pretty big deal. WPA-2 is vulnerable at the protocol level so it doesn't really matter if you use WPA Enterprise; it's just as vulnerable.  So yeah. "Oops" describes this mess pretty well.  If anything this shows the importance of end-to-end encryption and that now in 2017 there is no excuse at all anymore to not offer https to your customers.  Edit: Fortunately it can also be patched client-side so the world isn't coming to an end just yet (thanks /u/Chee5e) Edit 2: To all the people in this thread correcting others: please keep in mind that when this was posted the site explaining the exploit was not live yet and it seemed a LOT more severe.   
 Do we now need WPA3? No, luckily implementations can be patched in a backwards-compatible manner. This means a patched client can still communicate with an unpatched access point, and vice versa. In other words, a patched client or access points sends exactly the same handshake messages as before, and at exactly the same moments in time. However, the security updates will assure a key is only installed once, preventing our attacks. So again, update all your devices once security updates are available.  https://www.krackattacks.com/

It's "broken" in a very different way to WEP - to be the same it would have to be a vulnerability in AES. The problem is actually a mistake in the mechanism for negotiating security parameters between the client and AP. It can be predictable - which means an eavesdropper could possibly intercept that negotiation and calculate the security parameters it needs to receive data from the client unencrypted at Layer 1/2.  People are reporting this as a "fundamental" flaw - but it isn't. It's a poorly implemented handshake process. Because of that, it is fixable through patching.  
Good to hear. Unfortunately it will take a LONG time until access points are patched though. So we should still consider access points to be insecure by default.   
Routers from ISPs will surely be updated. Surely...

 Basically WPA is just as 'bad' as WEP now.  Almost, but I'm still missing the part where the key could be recovered. Which would just be the plot twist to change that disaster into ubiqitous available Wifi everywhere in the world. I loved WEP for that. EDIT: There's no ubiquitous wifi:  Note that our attacks do not recover the password of the Wi-Fi network.   
How hard was it to crack WEP? Like how much time did it take?  
Couple seconds  
How hard was it to crack WEP? Like how much time did it take?  
It took about 4 years. Once the exploit was found it wasn't hard to fully open. In any security protocol, it takes a monumental amount of effort to close all the holes but it only takes one to destroy all that effort. The PS3 was a prime example of this, it lasted years until a key was found and then it was open season. WEP was the same and as it was embedded it was impossible to close the exploit. So this is a pretty serious problem and really can only be solved by end to end encryption on top of the standard network/wifi encryption.  
How hard was it to crack WEP? Like how much time did it take?  
Minutes with kali's built in tools. So easy that there is a lifehacker article on it.

Precisely. WPA2 is now default insecure. We may eventually get to a point where a client (cellphone, laptop, etc) may be able to run a test exploit and warn the user "this AP is unpatched and you may be leaking info to an attacker", but that's not coming along for a long time, if ever, especially since it's of grey-legality (since it technically violates CFAA and similar). Not to mention that there are plenty of routers in sales channels that were manufactured before the exploit was announced or patched, and will thus be delivered to customers "new" who statistically speaking are unlikely to patch - "don't fix what isn't broken" and all that. The sad news is that there's no longer such a thing as secure WiFi, since even if you know you patched your equipment, your users can't really verify that.

Unless your router was made in the past 3 - 5 years it probably doesn't autoupdate.  And it probably isn't supported anyway.

Suddenly that $40 I spent on a VPN after a scary letter from my ISP about downloading something is looking better.  
If you were worried about scary letters from your ISP, then having a proven exploit in wireless security would actually help your case.  Also, a VPN doesn't help you too much for this exploit. You shouldn't be sending anything important unencrypted, anyways. VPN or not, if I can access your network, you've got trouble.  
But with VPN (or SSL) at least your stuff is encrypted in transit (until they manage a MITM attack that is). With this WPA 'krack' it isn't.   
Traffic snooping is the least of the problems introduced by this flaw. Local network access is where the gold is.

Is this the time for WPA3? I'd like to see public wifi networks being encrypted now...  
Encrypting public networks is close to useless. You never know whether the person providing the access point is evil or not (they could easily be pretending to be any legit access point), so you kind of have to assume that they are. For example, if there was free $mycity Wi-Fi, I could set up an access point called "$mycity Free Wi-Fi" and grab all the data that comes through. Since I as the access point operator have to be able to decrypt the data (otherwise I couldn't forward it to the right place), I know the key, and all the data is mine if I want it. To secure this, you'd have to have a way for the access point to prove that it's legit, e.g. by publishing certificates in a place that's hard for an evil person to manipulate or fake. And then people have to actually check against the certificate, else all of this is a complete waste of time.  
 Encrypting public networks is close to useless.   No, it isn't. It was with WEP, where every client had the same en-/decryption key. But with WPA and WPA2 people use a session key. This is actually what the 4-way handshake is about: setting up a session key. That means also that client A has a different session key than client B. And so client A has a little bit of difficulty (would WPA/WPA2 be secure) to eavesdrop on client B.

Asking without googling first. But why is wifi less secure than 3G. Both are wireless, I guess the sim card holds encryption keys, but couldn't your router exchange the same keys when you do the wps/whatever setup when you press the button? At least why isn't this another security protocol along wep and the rest?  
 3G  3G, e.g. GSM, was never secure. It has flaws known since 2009 and never was fixed.  I guess the sim card holds encryption keys  If you think this, then probably it's much better to send you off so that you buy yourself a book of "Applied Cryptography" from Bruce Schneier. This is a very readable book, you don't need to be a Ph.D. on maths for it. Sorry if this sounds like a snide remark, but I really have the feeling that you need first to get the basics. A reddit post / answer isn't really for way to teach this.  
Yes, thanks for the book recommendation. I do know the basics, how far was I off? I'd presumed the sim card has the public key of the operator and the operator has the public key of the card. But you're right, I'll do my research first before asking on reddit.

What a great way for the developer to learn that compiling for 64 bit doesn't increases the size of integers to 64 bits.  
I think the biggest issue is the implicit assumption that sizeof(long) > sizeof(int), which is not true in the LLP64 model used by the MS compiler. It's a bit sad that people seem so reluctant to use explicitly-sized types.  
I think the biggest issue here is to translate a date string into an integer "as-is". The MS ecosystem had future proof date values for a long time now.  
Storing sequences of ints as ints instead of strings is a pet peeve of mine. Always goes well when you then have a leading zero for some reason. Oh and this overflow issue.  
I think the biggest issue is the implicit assumption that sizeof(long) > sizeof(int), which is not true in the LLP64 model used by the MS compiler. It's a bit sad that people seem so reluctant to use explicitly-sized types.  
 It's a bit sad that people seem so reluctant to use explicitly-sized types.   It's mind-boggling to me that this wasn't standardized in every language ever.  
It's a hold over from when people were writing C with the assumption that their library code might run on a wide range of cpus, like back in the day when windows did run on 16-bit cpus. They were relying on the compiler to size the types appropriately for the platform they were compiling for, so it would run no matter if the cpu was 8, 16, 32, or 64 bit. PoRtaBilItY It's a terrible idea, a terrible habit, and it doesn't apply in lots of situations like date math code. But the habit is hard to break, and there's a lot of legacy code out there. Im glad that newer languages (C# in particular) only has explicitly sized types. An int is always 32 bit.

Indeed.  And in fifty years it will be mind-boggling how we missed tricks now that will be so obvious then.

In C, explicitly sized types (int64_t etc) aren‚Äôt actually guaranteed to exist. I mean, they WILL exist on any platform you or I ever actually target, and I think historically have existed on any platform that MSVC has supported, but if you‚Äôre a mediocre developer (or, especially, a mediocre dev promoted to management) you‚Äôre going to read ‚Äúnot guaranteed by the standard to exist on all platforms‚Äù and issue guidelines saying not to use them.  
That‚Äôs only true if you‚Äôre using really old C compilers. Explicitly sized types have been standardized for literally decades.

What a great way for the developer to learn that compiling for 64 bit doesn't increases the size of integers to 64 bits.  
Would you be willing to expound on that? A quick explanation of why?  
I think it breaks too many x86 software if the integer size was raised, so it was left at 32 bits. https://stackoverflow.com/a/7180344/1642933 EDIT: To clarify, this is an artificial limit and nothing stops you from writing a compiler that actually uses 64 bit integers as the default int type and have it work perfectly fine by itself. It's when you interact with the operating system that expects 32 bit integers as API values where everything goes wrong. EDIT2: Additionally you actually lose 16 or 32 bit integers unless you added some compiler specific integer type. Because between char and int is only short (or short int for the full name). char on x86 must be a single byte (C dictates that sizeof(char)==1) so if you define int as 64 bit (sizeof(int)==8), you only have the "short" type left for smaller integers. Do you pick 16 or 32 bits? This may actually be a much bigger reason to have int still as 32 bits.  
[deleted]  
Would you be willing to expound on that? A quick explanation of why?  
Because making integers bigger would unnecessarily take more memory for the same code. One of the goals of higher architectures is larger address space (more houses per road) not necessarily just larger data bus size (bigger houses possible on the road). If it takes 1 GB of memory to run an application and 50% of that application is integers, you just increased the memory footprint by 0.5 GB, even if you don't need bigger integer sizes.

On windows, even longs stay 32bit but Linux longs are 64bit, just to give you some nice cross platform compatibility issues

For being a company that does nothing but software, Microsoft is a terrible software company. Their Xbox app is one of the worst apps I‚Äôve ever had to deal with.  
It's actually kind of entertaining. Windows is basically built on a few decades of garbage implementations and workarounds, their C++ headers are terrifyingly bad. Any app they create that is included with windows, especially the Xbox app as you mentioned is just a travesty. The photos app doesn't even work properly in Win11... the fucking PHOTOS app. Yet they have .NET, C#, VSCode, Visual Studio, and a whole bunch of other incredible software tools that are very well designed. Like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

I worked with middleware that insisted that ip addresses were supplied as four strings of three ANSI characters, including the leading zeroes in one context and then as four integers in another (took me a while to track down that bug and put a wrapper in place to account for it). Phone numbers as numbers wouldn't surprise me at all.

A lot of languages' time libraries suck, to be fair. Not as bad as this bizarre hand-rolled format, but still pretty bad. For example, in Java the situation has much improved in recent years, but for many years if you used either of the two(!) time libraries included with the JDK you were just begging for trouble. Now the third (yes, really) bundled time library is finally good. As I understand it Python's built-in tools are pretty dreadful to this day, and it is not the only language in this position. So, yes, use someone's date/time library, because date/time is impossible and someone has thought about it more than you have. But not necessarily the one bundled with the language.

 COBOL guy here, veteran of the the Y2K programming push  I literally had to fix a Y2K fix two days ago. We still get two-digit years from the mainframe, and we have to convert them to four-digit years in our (Java) code. In one particular program this was done like:   if (yy.compareTo("20") > 0) {     year = "19" + yy; } else {     year = "20" + yy; }  This particular program was working with dates mostly from the previous year. So now that we're getting into 2022, it was starting to get 2021 years. And since "21".compareTo("20") > 0 is true, the two-digit year "21" became the four digit year "1921"...

And this must have been invented after Y2K: older dates won't fit either. To print something sane with %d (which I presume is the motivation), it also needs a date after 2010, when 64-bit systems are becoming mainstream. Lesson learned: we need to stop using designs that are outdated at the time of design. I swear I'll stop using Python 2.7 for my next script.  
Why did it need to be after 2010? Why would 2005 print any different  
Because it‚Äôs a two-digit year. It would have to be single-digit or zero-prefixed. Both of which looks silly.  
At least in Python you can do "{num:06d}" to format a number that is padded with zeros only if necessary. >>> x = 220101 >>> f"20{x:06d}" '20220101' >>> x = 50101 >>> f"20{x:06d}" '20050101'  Edit: not sure about other languages that actually use proper number representation, lol.

Wasn't this what everyone was worried about for Y2K? Here we are 22 years later fighting off a plague, and "oh yeah the date rollover buggered our computers lol" A bit of dark comedy for you  
Dates are a very common pitfall in programming. They seem simple but as soon as you actually start to work with them, you realize how complex they are. There's the normal stuff like getting the number of days per month right, then leap years, fitting weeks and days and months all together correctly, and then you get into the really tough things like time zones and daylight saving (oh, you assumed each day was 24 hours? twice a year it isn't!) and leap seconds and moving across borders (if you liked daylight saving, good news, you can do it as much as you want in some places!) and bad hardware clocks (hope your software still functions when suddenly it's 1970, or when time stops entirely).  Then add in a penchant for "doing it more efficiently" or "only using what we need" and you get things like this, where whether you know it or not, you've put an expiration date on your software and hopefully it can be noticed and fixed before problems happen.  
Yup, see falsehoods programmers believe about time

I wonder what the impact of the 2025 problem, a.k.a. Showa 100 problem, will be. Some Japanese computers systems written in the 80s use Japanese calendar for dates, which works in eras tied to reigns of the emperors, but were not designed for switching to a new era, so they keep counting as if the guy whose army bombed Pearl Harbor were still alive. Showa era ended in 1989, but if it never did, 2025 would be Showa 100. And if you have only two digits for the year... You know where it's going.

You need to make a lot of dumb decisions before storing a date this way. I would expect this wouldn't occur often. The parser code for it would look... Interesting. Lots of zeroes and modulo.

Stuff like that is infuriating. Climate and weather data in myriad online repos everywhere, especially from government met agencies-- I'll generously say about a 6th of my time something in my scripts might fall over because of weird date-parsing. Either it's just a number, or it includes some sort of meta information like time zone or units (e.g. "seconds since HMS"), maybe it's a satellite that uses a special format for "leap seconds." Don't forget the classic: is 20200809, September 8th, or August 9th? Edit: forgot to whine about strange delimiters. If you store 20200809 so it somehow dumps out as 20,200,809.... A comma delimited text file is pretty... Special.  
As someone who has spent a decade writing drivers and parsers for met and air data, I think I've seen just about everything. No two devices used the same date format. Some devices used different formats for getting the clock, setting the clock, sending a data request, and timestamping the data. Infuriating. When my turn came to write one, it was 100% ISO8601 on the wire. Internally I used .Net's "ticks" in a long int for database timestamps.

Could someone explain this bug in simpler terms? I work as a developer but I don't understand what this means  
They were storing times formatted like this: 2 digits for the year, 2 digits for the month, 2 digits for the day, 2 digits for the hour, 2 digits for the minute. So 2021-09-13 14:37 becomes 2109131437. ... except then, instead of storing it as a string like a sane person, they tried to store it as an integer. 4-byte signed integers can go from -231 to +231 - 1, so -2147483648 to 2147483647. With New Years 2022 the time ticked over from 2112312359 (2021-12-31 23:59) to 2201010000 (2022-01-01 00:00), which all of a sudden is outside the bounds of a 4-byte integer, thus throwing some form of type error on the conversion to integer.

So 2021-09-13 14:37 becomes 2109131437. ... except then, instead of storing it as a string like a sane person, they tried to store it as an integer. 4-byte signed integers can go from -231 to +231 - 1, so -2147483648 to 2147483647. With New Years 2022 the time ticked over from 2112312359 (2021-12-31 23:59) to 2201010000 (2022-01-01 00:00), which all of a sudden is outside the bounds of a 4-byte integer, thus throwing some form of type error on the conversion to integer.  
thanks for explaining. I read all the comments and still didn't understand, because my brain just wouldn't compute that anyone would choose to store a date like that. why?  
Could someone explain this bug in simpler terms? I work as a developer but I don't understand what this means  
Microsoft apparently stores the current date in a format like YYMMDDhhmm So yesterday (2021-12-31T23:59:00) would be stored as: 2112312359 or with thousand separators: 2,112,312,359  This is lower than the maximum unsigned integer value: 2147483647 or with thousand separators: 2,147,483,647  Today the year incremented, so Microsoft exchange tries to parse this date as an integer (2022-01-01T00:00:00) 2201010000 or with thousand separators: 2,201, 010,000  This number it higher than what an unsigned int can store, so the date parsing fails, which crashes the Exhange server... EDIT: Mixed up signed and unsigned... Thanks for pointing it out /u/alphaatom  
How does that handle dates before 2000  
It probably doesn't...

How can it be that msoft's QA department isn't running test servers with clocks set a month, a year, and maybe even 20 years (hi, 2038!) in the future? How can that be? If they were, they would have known this was going to happen and remediated it. What are the rich corporations who buy and use their own Exchange rigs paying for, anyway?

It's interesting how the hack occured https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/06/intel_nda_source_code_leak/ It was an attack to an Akamai server at the beginning of the year, I suspect this was a file server right when people were figuring out how to do remote work.

Oh yeah, this exploit in particular is from this and I think he hasn't leaked more stuff from this exploit. Most of other things are misconfigured network on SonarQube instances that exposed them to Internet. This is sad because I imagine development teams were proud of having continuous integration but did not used something like a Nexus (Sonatype) to proxy/store the packages in the intranet, and instead relied on getting things from Maven and such directly. But most dumps don't document how they were gotten. I guess people exploit a flaw for some months before leaking what was downloaded so the person doesn't figure out and fix the flaw quickly. Edit: a statement from sonar devs https://blog.sonarsource.com/public-response-code-leaks

I just got hired at a young but promising tech company. I had to sign an NDA just to interview with them, mandatory badge if I'm ever onsite, etc. Every onboarding powerpoint, schedule, memo, and article I see is marked confidential in the corner. And my team collaborates all day long on Zoom, sharing information that would let the competition size us up pretty easily.  
Because everything they made you do was about compliance box checking for audit controls, not actual security. Some elements (such as the badge) help against basic social engineering and physical access, but they're just a minimal layer of what should be a more comprehensive plan.  
Nothing actually says what you have to do for compliance, only that you do something and can prove you did.

Intel said this: https://www.tomshardware.com/news/massive-20gb-intel-data-breach-floods-the-internet-mentions-backdoors "We are investigating this situation. The information appears to come from the Intel Resource and Design Center, which hosts information for use by our customers, partners and other external parties who have registered for access. We believe an individual with access downloaded and shared this data." Hardly a hack.... Just a violation of an NDA. Not really shocking or amazing or sneaky or all these things everyone makes it out to be. The notorious hacker 4chan isn't at it again.  
I guess you haven't seen the other dumps or downloaded the files. While this is a possibility the dude of leaks has source and info on a ton of chips and things that have been verified in the past. Remember, he isn't the one who hacks, he leaks and publishes hacks people send his way. Judging from his history it started when people send him docs on the inner workings of Widevine. The Intel content is a ton of files, so it's hard to parse everything now. At the beginning of the year most source hacks he received were misconfigured SonarQube instances in CI systems. The dude with the leaks says his source has more things, I would wait a bit to see what this turns out to be. Edit: also there's a possibility that it is a hack to a third party so not an intentional NDA breach.  
Not sure if you have ever worked under an NDA, but it's not super secret society kind of stuff. You just get access to stuff easily, under the promise that if you leak it you will be held legally accountable. It's way more likely an intern or dumbass is the cause. Calling any of this "hacks" is like calling a guy who walks in your open door and takes your milk a secret agent spy.

It's common to intentionally use weak passwords on resources you don't care about. Like dev environments and such.  
Exactly. Imagine having a VM or something you distribute as a dev env and not a company wide dummy password for root on them. Sometimes stuff has to have a password for the sake of having it.

I have been a software engineer in corporate environments for 25 years and I have never heard the term "backdoor" used to mean anything other than a way to access a resource with a weaker security check (or to circumvent a security check).  It might not be intended for "intruders," it might be for employees to debug issues, or admins of a company to get access to other data, etc. But there isn't a standard technical meaning beyond the common one.  
I am 5 years /u/FunkyPete 's junior, but I concur.  It only has one meaning, an intentional security vulnerability that it's used out of convenience (or perhaps malice) to gain access to something ostensibly well secured.  
Intel VP here, you conspiracy guys are always taking things the wrong way. Back door, is the opposite of front door. In case of fire you can exit through either the front or back door. Now move along, nothing to see here. I said MOVE ALONG!!!

stop saying backdoor.  The proper term is "management engine" IMHO anyone who doubts there's an entire complex autonomous system inside of every single chipset for the past decade+ with ring -3 access that hasn't been fucked sideways by AT LEAST the NSA and CCP is a certifiable idiot.  
Carry on the fight. I'm old and tired and nobody ever listens anyway. Anybody who can rub two bytes together should have the intelligence to figure that any hardware device that's completely un-auditable would have more holes than swiss cheese. I'm sure there are holes for our government, Intel and probably other governments. Nothing that passes through a network or computer can be considered safe.  
This is exactly why I'm hoping RISC-V starts getting more traction. We really need to have open source hardware that we can actually trust.

Maybe opensource devs can use this data as documentation for opensource firmware.  
Unfortunately not, this is still proprietary unlicensed code owned by intel - you can't use knowledge gained from studying it as the basis for open source reverse engineering efforts.  For example, WINE (a compatibility layer for running Windows applications on Linux) won't accept contributions from anyone who has seen windows code.  
Leaks have been previously used as a basis for documenting previously undocumented hardware; this is supposedly court-tested for cases where the documenting people and the implementing people never mix except via unidirectional documentation. Similarly, cryptographic signing keys (such as for firmware upgrades) have been judged uncopyrightable; though as a practical matter a court couldn't put that genie back in the bottle anyway. So you're right in the trivial sense, which isn't what happens in the real world. And I wish I could've had your username.  
You have to take care that it‚Äôs ‚Äúclean room‚Äù The issue isn‚Äôt whether you‚Äôll win the court cases. It‚Äôs whether you‚Äôll have to pay for protracted legal proceedings and if doing so will bankrupt you.  It‚Äôs best to just avoid this like the plague if you work on such projects or plan on doing so.  Here‚Äôs a tweet from the Dolphin project about the recent Nintendo Leaks https://mobile.twitter.com/Dolphin_Emu/status/1257051968045899776  We cannot use anything of any sort from a leak. In fact, we can't even look at it. Dolphin is only legal because we are clean room reverse engineering the GameCube and Wii. If we use anything from a leak, Dolphin is no longer legal and Nintendo will shut us down.

Honestly, i feel bad for Intel. They were such a great company back in the days...  
A lot of complacency in recent years though. Lots of quality issues, broken 10nm process, now broken 7nm process. Looks like things systematically went wrong after some point.  
About the point that marketing became their core competency. Maybe after the success of  ‚Äúintel inside‚Äù.

I mean, pentium 4 was broken to the core and Intel was engaging in extensive and illegal anti-competitive practices (fined $1B for it) at the time. They only got saved because their small Israeli team happened to have a mobile architecture with a new paradigm that had some legs (strip everything back down, build back up with a focus on performance per watt, and cut features that do not fit the guidelines even if they boost performance), and said architecture  happened to scale up extremely cleanly into the desktop power space/Core processors. Intel coasted on that for a very long time.  When you consider that during this time NVIDIA went from a 10B company to a 250B company by capturing stream compute and now ML compute, AMD leapfrogged Intel with a solid chiplet architecture using Jim Keller, a dirt shed, and some monopoly money, ARM continued to dominate the entire ultra-low-power space... the list goes on... Intel starts to look like Microsoft when they missed the wave of dotcom innovation. Really, given Intel's dominant position, Intel should have been expected to nail a lot of those markets, and go above and beyond that by innovating and doing some market making through innovation. The only thing sadder than Intel's total miss on so many valuable spaces is Intel's horrific failures with Larrabbee, mobile processors, and aimless wandering in IOT. There are some notable exceptions like 3D Xpoint but not enough.

That's a pretty over-the-top soundtrack for the F12 key  
You wouldn't F12 a car!  
Dude I was trying to turn down my brightness the other day and accidentally F12ed a federal government website... I'm so scared, never closed out of a window faster in my life.  
You wouldn't F12 a car!  
You wouldn't F12 a baby!  
That's a pretty over-the-top soundtrack for the F12 key  
To be fair the SSNs were encoded with base64.  So basically 1% more secure than plain text  
It's not obfuscation at that point, it's just encoding. Base64 is not a secret.  The people that should be charged are the people trying to raise criminal charges in the first place, for wrongful prosecution. That, and the developers that created this and the project managers that accepted the work should all be investigated for squandering taxpayer funds.  Maybe we the people should press charges of gross incompetence towards the governor.  
 It's not obfuscation at that point, it's just encoding. Base64 is not a secret.   Seriously. Plaintext to Base64 is like changing ASCII to UTF-8 and saying, "it's now more secure".

To me that's actually worse, since it indicates that at some point someone knew that the application could leak sensitive data then went about trying to mitigate that in the absolute stupidest way possible.  
Fun story: I once was asked to track down a bug in an in-house HR application for people to check their paystubs. It was related to login stuff, so I was tracing through the login code, only to see that your session was maintained by writing out a cookie containing a base64 encoded user-ID. There was no validation beyond that- if you set the cookie yourself, you wouldn't get prompted for a password.

That's not the reason it was encoded. The reason it was encoded was that someone stored the data in a general purpose user side data store, which automatically uses base64 to avoid string handling problems.

Oui, vous avez raison.  
To be fair the SSNs were encoded with base64.  So basically 1% more secure than plain text  
 To be fair the SSNs were encoded with base64.  Holy cow.  Can you imagine the level of dysfunction during development?  Not only did none of the programmers raise the alarm*, but neither did anyone reviewing the design.  And there was obviously no independent security review...  all for a government website. I bet this was outsourced.  In other countries, government ID numbers aren't considered a secret or sensitive like the SSN is in the US.  When immigrants come to the US, they have to be warned not to give anyone their SSN. It would be interesting to know who did the work. * Maybe someone did and they were ignored, which is just as bad.  
The problem with big, well funded projects like this is that the project manager will often keep a "risk register" of things discovered during development that in any rational and sane world would require them to go back around and address after a development cycle. I can almost guarantee there's a risk register somewhere for this, with this on it alongside a bunch of other vulnerabilities and the signature of the "responsible client manager" of some government crony who is supposed to be the "liason officer" for the project right next to all of them to signify it's not a big deal or "within acceptable risk profiles", which is code for most of them to say "I do not know what this is, or why it's a big deal, but it will stop my project and the only thing that matters to me is signing this project off on time so I can take the money and leave this company while putting a success on my CV." I've been around many project managers and only a very small percentage of them were worth the paper their "risk registers" were printed on, responsible client liason managers even less so.

One way is that the client might have asked for a view in the application that wasn‚Äôt in the original scope so to not extend the project out another 2 months they duplicated the code for the closest existing view an removed the all parts they thought had private data.

I cannot believe someone paid money to make this video.  
It looks like the video is the same quality as the site: they didn‚Äôt even change match the grading for the background image and the superimposed video.    They really should stop hiring family memhers.  
Someone in the YouTube comments even pointed out that the power outlet on the left of the TV is not North American. They couldn't even be bothered to use american stock images!  
You mean to say that somebody in the YouTube comments hacked the video by noticing a detail that wasn't meant to be seen.  
I cannot believe someone paid money to make this video.  
You need to up your cynicism level: * Denying the truth and doubling down is now a viable path when facing criticism * This kind of video moves the Overton Window, making a similar response in the future more socially acceptable * At least some people will be convinced by this kind of content * This plays perfectly well into the narrative of ‚ÄúBig Media is fake news‚Äù and systematically continues to dismantle objective truth while reinforcing the existing paradigm his supporters live within This is blatant disinformation. Edit: Given how effective the impact has been I imagine the return on investment is pretty good. You can even get the content amplified, have external actors fan the flames of the controversy and have your point of view shared widely for free.

There actually has to actually be prosecution first which is unlikely to happen. This wasn't produced by the governor but rather a PAC.

The most telling thing for me was when this first made the news a bunch of Twitter people started talking about how we needed understanding for the governor, and we should educate him politely. Meanwhile, this Maniac is attempting to file charges against someone for looking at the source to a web page. I can't help but get the feeling that there are a lot of people attempting to pull cover for this guy. It's insane to think that he could speak to a prosecutor for more than 2 seconds and still walk away with the thought that charges are ever going to be filed.

You give someone a Word document of your Resume. At the bottom of the document, you put your password to your login on a job portal, text colored white on a white background, so it's hidden - just so you don't lose it. That recruiter accidentally highlights the password while reviewing the document and says "hey, I noticed what looks like a password. I'm not going to use it, but I wanted to let you know that it's a bad idea to do this." And you make it your life mission to sue the living shit out of that company for hacking your text document with this hacker's feature that lets you select text with your cursor. It's just as insane  
I was trying to think through how I‚Äôm going to explain this to my 70+ year old aunts and uncles; This is the perfect metaphor to get the idea across, thanks  
Lucky. My parents don't know what a word document is or that you can color text. Might have better luck saying they left a password under the keyboard at a public library hoping no one would pick it up for any reason.

Another good analogy: Imagine a stranger shows up at your door with your wallet, says "I think you may have lost this. I just found it on the sidewalk over there, took a look at your ID and realized you were right around the corner so I wanted to drop this off right away before you panic." The wallet is just as you lost it, no money taken, all your cards and IDs safe and sound.  And your reply is "I am calling the police, how dare you steal my wallet and home address!"

It's ok to not know how something works. There's simply too many things in the world for everyone to know everything about all of it. Which is why you surround yourself with experts who can fill you in on things.   This guy is actually just a moron for ignoring his advisors. Anyone browsing this sub is fully aware, but the governor is basically saying it's a crime to read a book at the library, that the library made available for you.  If you don't want people looking at teacher's SSN, then don't hand that data out to everyone browsing your site. Or just retire, you absolute dinosaur.

Furthermore, is the governor implying that the only authorized and legal way to access that website is with a modern GUI-based browser? what about lynx? where do we draw the line? Arguably, the client computer is not property of the state and any data intentionally sent by the server is considered authorized data (as the state sent it) and it is the responsibility for the client to render that data in whatever way it sees fit.

Adobe to end-of-life Flash by 2020
Adobe:  Adobe is planning to end-of-life Flash. Specifically, we will stop updating and distributing the Flash Player at the end of 2020 and encourage content creators to migrate any existing Flash content to these new open formats.  Google:  Chrome will continue phasing out Flash over the next few years, first by asking for your permission to run Flash in more situations, and eventually disabling it by default. We will remove Flash completely from Chrome toward the end of 2020.  Mozilla:   Starting next month, users will choose which websites are able to run the Flash plugin. Flash will be disabled by default for most users in 2019, and only users running the Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR) will be able to continue using Flash through the final end-of-life at the end of 2020. In order to preserve user security, once Flash is no longer supported by Adobe security patches, no version of Firefox will load the plugin.  Microsoft:   In mid to late 2018, we will update Microsoft Edge to require permission for Flash to be run each session. Internet Explorer will continue to allow Flash for all sites in 2018. In mid to late 2019, we will disable Flash by default in both Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer. Users will be able to re-enable Flash in both browsers. When re-enabled, Microsoft Edge will continue to require approval for Flash on a site-by-site basis. By the end of 2020, we will remove the ability to run Adobe Flash in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer across all supported versions of Microsoft Windows. Users will no longer have any ability to enable or run Flash.   Looks like Flash will be completely dead by the end of 2020.

This is, in all seriousness, kinda depressing. There's lots of old flash games I love to go back and play from time to time, that I'm fairly sure the creators have long since abandoned and have no interest in porting. I'm sure you could download them, run them on an old browser version in a VM or something, but it's kind of a pain in the ass, and definitely beyond what most casual players would be willing or able to do. I hope they build some kind of legacy sandbox to allow you to still enjoy old content in.

Flash will be disabled by default for most users in 2019, and only users running the Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR) will be able to continue using Flash through the final end-of-life at the end of 2020. In order to preserve user security, once Flash is no longer supported by Adobe security patches, no version of Firefox will load the plugin.  Microsoft:   In mid to late 2018, we will update Microsoft Edge to require permission for Flash to be run each session. Internet Explorer will continue to allow Flash for all sites in 2018. In mid to late 2019, we will disable Flash by default in both Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer. Users will be able to re-enable Flash in both browsers. When re-enabled, Microsoft Edge will continue to require approval for Flash on a site-by-site basis. By the end of 2020, we will remove the ability to run Adobe Flash in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer across all supported versions of Microsoft Windows. Users will no longer have any ability to enable or run Flash.   Looks like Flash will be completely dead by the end of 2020.

The use of WinXP past EOL shows that they won't give up even when the product is dead.  I'm not sure what else can be done

Lots of misinformation in this thread, so I'm hijacking the top comment. Adobe will only end support for the Flash Player. The animation software that used to be called Adobe Flash Professional was rebranded to Adobe Animate, and will continue to be developed and supported by Adobe.  
What does that mean for users of that software?  Will it render to HTML5?  
It has for a while now. Even before they rebranded it.

I wonder what will happen to all the games and animations of Newgrounds. I really love that site, and I confess I spent a lot of my time watching the superb animations from so many amazing creators in there.   
[deleted]  
It's Adobe, I feel that's a good reason.   
[deleted]  
They may feel there's IP in there which they still want to protect. Though they are probably wrong and should. But it's Adobe...  
Might not even be about wanting to protect IP.  There might be code in it that was written by contractors/consultants many years ago that they actually do not have the right to open source. That's one of the reasons the CDDL is incompatible with the GPL, despite what whiny Linux nerds will tell you‚Äîthere were a lot of drivers and other code that absolutely needed to ship with Solaris, but that code could not be open-sourced because Sun did not own the rights to the code and didn't even necessarily have a way to contact the original creator(s). IP laws are complicated, especially when the rights span multiple countries.  
[deleted]  
Open sourcing proprietary programs is more complicated than simply sticking it on your Github instance with a GPL license.  When you open source the code, you have to go through each module to check to see if you're using those modules with any of your other applications.  You also have to ensure that all of the code you publish is code you actually have the right to relicense.  It's very common for one companies' code to include libraries or modules from other places that you might be allowed to use internally to your own code, but that you can't relicense. Basically, it's a pain, it gets lawyers in a twist, and when you already have 'open' versions like Pepper Flash around it doesn't necessarily make sense to spend the dev time working on it.

So I get that people hate Flash now, but for a long time, Flash WAS the cutting edge of interactive design, and it was awesome. Honestly, I don't see that level of experimentation or creativity in interactive stuff these days (either on desktop, web, or mobile).  
Agreed. I'm not a fan of Flash anymore, but back in the day, I remembered the endless amount of Flash games available on the web that kept me entertained for hours. I think, now with the rise of Steam and other game distributors, the appeal to use Flash for animations and games has dropped. JavaScript could replace Flash entirely with new libraries and implementations, but I don't think anyone is interested in web games. I still think, though, JavaScript/CSS animation will continue to be a big part of the web.  
I agree with all of that, but remember that most people (but not most people on this sub) primarily use smartphones and iPads for this sort of thing now. Phone games replaced web games. Desktop computing has really fallen off.

The problem is 'Flash' is actually a bunch of different parts and people naively associate it with obnoxious banner ads from the early days of internet (or are just repeating stuff without any understanding of what Flash was). Flash was an amazing animation tool Flash was an awesome development ide (AS3) that could cross compile in order to make solid desktop and mobile apps Flash was a browser plugin meant to play the output of the other above two tools and pushed the capabilities of what you could do in the browser for a long time. Unfortunately that also means it often had security issues, turns out when you have to access the OS instead of just displaying very limited html that it is harder to secure. Also since it ran in a browser for most of its life it did not have access to hardware acceleration which meant you were running graphics and games on pure CPU. Surprise! That is of course not going be good performance. AND the majority of our experience with Flash was on much slower computers where even AAA games built in C++ had limited graphics.. so I'd say it did a pretty fucking good job. But of course most of the top comments are "har har I haven't used flash since __ ", "derp flash is trash" because hating on Flash makes idiot programmers feel part of the herd.  
[deleted]  
Yeah also, remember web video before Flash? Exactly. There basically wasn't any. Flash was the only solution that even vaguely worked. It was shit in a lot of ways but it did have some positive effects.  
I actually do. Embedded realplayer and quicktime videos, and downloadable wmvs. It was even more disgusting than it sounds.

Yeah, seriously. I see people in here crowing about the death of an evil obsolete technology and it's like they just don't care about the giant cultural trove of work made with that platform. There was a really good Lego flash game, years ago, called The Nightfall Incident. It was on a really old version of Flash, so old it was still called Macromedia Shockwave, and to play it these days step 1 is 'set up a Windows 7 VM'. Pretty soon step 2 is going to be 'download old versions of the browser and Flash from whatever dodgy website comes up on Google'. Pretty soon a decade and a half of glorious variety of Flash games and animations are going to follow suit. That's pretty sad, especially when so many people seem aggressively keen to accelerate the process.  
That's what I keep thinking about, too. However people feel about them now, places like Newgrounds were a huge part of early internet culture. Flash going away without necessary exports will turn all of that content into a locked museum with the lights turned off.  
[deleted]  
One option is to download the SWF and run Flash Player outside of the browser. If push comes to shove, you can run a VM and install Flash and a version of Firefox which is compatible with it. Heck, that's probably safer than running Flash natively. In addition, Mozilla developed shumway, a Flash VM and runtime written in JavaScript. I don't know how well it works, though. Once Adobe finishes killing off Flash, I'm sure we'll see an electron+shumway alternative to Flash Player, if there isn't one already. Sadly, this is one of the risks of depending on a closed source plugin. Adobe could gain some good will from the tech community if they open sourced Flash once it's EOL'd.

Flash (the editor) exports HTML5 now. It doesn't support everything Flash Player did, but it's enough to create content. We have SVG, we have HTML5 2D and 3D transforms and other effect filters, most importantly we have WebGL which allows unprecedented performance and control over graphics. Plus, the web needed Flash for cartoons because bandwidth was scarce and video standards on the web were non-existent. In the MPEG4, Netflix and YouTube age, that's no longer an issue. So you can use any professional animation packages, or draw on napkins and take photos, doesn't matter, as long as you can make a video out of it, you're good to go and publish your work on the web today.

Flash is now animate cc which creates some javascript crap that's not remotely as performant as flash. Also html5 never was ment to be a successor, it's not as good for those things. And companies don't like to hear that it's 10 times more complicated and will cost a lot more to produce.

I like that, now-a-days, you can easily disable Flash on websites. I see this as a feature of Flash :).  However, the same is not true of HTML5 autoplaying videos. Even with browser extensions, certain websites keep retrying to play and these retries sometimes succeed if you scroll.

This is the best tl;dr I could make, original reduced by 78%. (I'm a bot)   Specifically, we will stop updating and distributing the Flash Player at the end of 2020 and encourage content creators to migrate any existing Flash content to these new open formats. Adobe will continue to support Flash on a number of major OSs and browsers that currently support Flash content through the planned EOL. This will include issuing regular security patches, maintaining OS and browser compatibility and adding features and capabilities as needed. We plan to move more aggressively to EOL Flash in certain geographies where unlicensed and outdated versions of Flash Player are being distributed.

How do you add this to Chrome?  
Down load the zip. Unpack it to a directory. Smart people, with the required coding skills as well, they look at the .js files, remove any trackers/phone home code. Then Chrome -> Settings -> Extensions -> Turn on Developer mode -> Load unpacked Find the extension directory, select it and then click Open. The extension is now added to Chrome. It'll load from that same location, so make sure it's a permanent one as Chrome will look each time it starts up.

This really sucks. I feel bad for this dude, if you read the article, he makes really good points. There aren‚Äôt really great alternatives to FB when it comes to staying connected to lots of friends and family without also being bombarded with ads and conspiracy theory crap. Since I deleted Facebook a few years ago, I‚Äôm more active in making photo galleries and sharing them direct with friends and fam via iCloud and text message- the downside is that type of shared content isn‚Äôt aggregated for everyone so you have to do all the user management yourself.

I created a browser extension that interacted with Facebook a few years back, and also received a C&D letter‚Äîwhere the lawyers managed to spell my name three different ways in so many pages‚Äîonce it went viral. The letter threatened to disable all my accounts, and since I was in the same situation as the author, I promptly complied with their terms: delete all source code, remove the extension from the store. The extension was open sourced anyway and already largely forked by the time I scrapped it, so it‚Äôd essentially become an immutable record on the internet. Every FB employee I talked to about the situation after the fact found the extension hilarious and were shocked to learn of the C&D ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  
What did the extension do?  
Showed a notification anytime someone started typing to you, whether you had the conversation open or not. Creepiest thing I‚Äôve built (yet). It was called ‚ÄúFacebook Sixth Sense‚Äù if you want to look it up.

there is a gist on github: https://gist.github.com/renestalder/c5b77635bfbec8f94d28 not sure if it works... I just googled it ‚Äã EDIT: IT WORKS.  
This does work, but to my disappointment the news feed was not empty after unfollowing everyone. It still assumes you want to see some of your friends' posts no matter what. I thought removing all my "Favorites" would do it too, but that had no effect. I tried logging out and back in too. Edit: Now that I think about it, maybe the posts I see are only those that were already in my feed before I unfollowed everyone? I'll update this comment later today with the results. Edit2: 5 hours later, and my feed in unchanged. I only see posts from before I ran the unfollow script.

True but if you do anything that has just a vague hypothetical chance to end in lawyers, get a effing "legal expense insurance". If they realize you aren't paying your legal fees yourself, it will make it a bit more annyoing for them if you drag them along.

A couple years ago I unfollowed everything manually and have never looked back. In the absence of plugins to do it automatically, I suspect many would be surprised how quickly they can unfollow everything by just clicking 'unfollow' on everything in your news feed until there's nothing left. Even if it takes time, it is a very satisfying experience during.

How convenient it is, to just crush studies, browsers, plugins that displease this company ? I mean, user addiction and data is the top 1 income source for this platform (as stated in the article), so I guess they bite hard when someone decide to propagate a way to reduce that for users. That's why I'm now boycotting FB, no users, no power. When I see that a company is ethically doing things worse and worse, I just stop using things related to them (as much as I can at least). They did so many bad things ... After buying the Oculus Rift from Microsoft, they forced users to use a FB account to log in (https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-facebook-accounts-being-banned) and users that hadn't any FB account created a brand new that was almost instantlty flagged as a spam/bot account and get banned. Therefore, they couldn't use the headset at all. Don't event need to talk about the data leaks and the recent services downs for straight 6 hours. The Facebook-Cambridge analytica scandal .. A major bug made some private messages publicated on public feed, made quite of a mess between people. And so on, ... If anybody knows a site where they list Facebook issues I would be grateful, for shaming purpose

In 2011, I unfriended Facebook. I'll never understand how billions of people continue to use it. Like an astronaut whose parents are flat-earthers. It irritates me to see people still using Facebook.  
I quit around the same time.  I had 8 solid years of doing just fine without it, and then I moved to a small community in Iceland, and it's almost impossible to manage without it, so I had to turn it back on two years ago.  Not only does nearly everyone I know use messenger exclusively to communicate, it's pretty much the only place other than word of mouth to buy or sell anything.  The bar I work part time at uses a facebook group for scheduling our shifts.  I know most people don't get put in the extreme case that I was, but I am sure plenty of people feel they'll miss out on a lot without it.  The tools themselves are great.  It's the algorithms, and the profit model that makes it horrible.  When FB was just a chronological feed of things your friends posted, it was fantastic, but that didn't make money, so they turned it into the cesspool that it is today.  
WhatsApp is like that for Germany. You just don‚Äôt have a social life if you don‚Äôt have WhatsApp.  
Europe in general is WhatsApp. I use it to talk to all my EU based friends and vendors, and haven't met a single person there who uses a different texting app. Asia has a couple more options, but they're no better or worse than WhatsApp if privacy is what you're looking for.  
In 2011, I unfriended Facebook. I'll never understand how billions of people continue to use it. Like an astronaut whose parents are flat-earthers. It irritates me to see people still using Facebook.  
I deleted my account years ago, but before I did I found out they have weighting on your facebook feed. If you are not active enough or do not have enough friends then posts you make will not show up on your friends feed if there is content facebook deems of higher value. This was particularly easy to notice because I had previously deleted my account and created a new one(so I'm now using a barren account). After noticing a lack of response in posts, where I used to get them I asked a friend to check. He could not see my wall posts at all without directly viewing my profile. In addition to this Facebook creates ghost profiles of people that do not use facebook, but that it would like to track on any website with facebook plugins. It's incredibly creepy how involved and accurate this is. Finally Facebook are one of the worst companies for clearly manipulating "studies" that show they aren't harming society. I'd be curious to see how many studies they are rejecting to find that one needle in the haystack that says Facebook isn't really detrimental to a lot of peoples mental health.

Living abroad it was the only real way to keep up with friends and family back home. I actually intended to drop Facebook when I moved, but ended up far too isolating. Clearly my specific case is more anecdotal than most, but unfortunate as it is, for a lot of people Facebook remains the best tool amongst its competitors for what they need it for.

Facebook has its problems, but through it I've been able to do lots of good things, like expand my genealogy research with groups of people who share that interest.  IDK if it's a UK/USA difference but at least the feed I see on FB isn't full of mad raving cunts, but that might be because I only really follow bands I like and cat groups  
Every time I see these threads I wonder how it can be so different. I don't go much on Facebook. Maybe once a day or so. But I don't see any of the madness people talk about. Just a quick look now at my feed. There's absolutely zero politics or memes. I got a couple birthdays, someone's pregnant, a dad asking recommendations for kids activities over the weekend, bunch of pics of ppl meeting for drinks or dinner, someone got a promotion, some pretty cool pics from the city by a buddy photographer....  
You've curated that content by either ignoring or unfriending people that post political/meme content and your social circle posts personal information to Facebook. None of my friends use Facebook in this way except for event scheduling, which is the only reason I still check it.

 The loser here is the user, and the cost is counted in billions of wasted hours spent on Facebook.  True... but the winner is Facebook because as the author mentions, they want users to do one thing and one thing only: keep scrolling down the newsfeed, seeing as many ads as possible, all day if possible. Things FB has no interest in their users doing:  have meaningful interactions outside the newsfeed. keep in touch only with people who reach out directly to them, rather than post generic things to everyone and the world (which is what keeps newsfeeds going) to grab as many likes as possible (addictive behaviour). leave after a short, reasonable amount of time, to do more useful things.  The cost for using their platform is that you use FB the way FB wants you to. I have to sympathize with FB here, they spent billions to be able to serve nearly the whole world population, who voluntarily signed up, and now they want their investment to give returns... by clearing the newsfeed, you made their product better for users, but useless to FB... why would FB want people to use their product in a way that generates no revenue to them? Objecting that is only possible if you think of FB as some kind of non-profit, charity or at least a public service... which they are patently not. They are your typical for-profit, multi-billion dollar corporation which has no reason to do anything at all that's not going to generate profit. Anything that they do that might benefit people, they do only as a means to making more money, like any other product company. This kind of discussion seems to miss that.

I wish there was a Firefox extension!  
looking at the source, it seems like the whole extension could work in Firefox if it used the standard extensions API . Maybe some intrepid coder wants to take that on. Although I have a different question when looking at the source... why does the extension load Amplitude?? That's a user behavior tracking library.

Yesterday, I used glitches to inject the source code for Flappy Bird into Super Mario World on SNES. Here‚Äôs how.
This is amazing. Do you have any plans to do this for more games? Is it possible to save this code so it will always run Flappy Bird when the game is launched?  
I don't currently have plans for other games. You could write the code to SRAM, which is where save files get stored, but you'd still have to trigger it by using an arbitrary code execution glitch if you reset.  
I don't know much about game hacking, but couldn't you make it execute random code while loading the save, in a similar fashion to how XSS is done?  
That's basically what was used to make homebrew possible on modern consoles, e.g. when Twilight Princess let you write as much data to memory as you want, just by editing the save to never null-terminate your horse's name. Problem is, SMW's save is extremely simple with no strings or variable-sized buffers in sight.

That'd require a pretty massive bug in the file loading system, but it's possible one's out there.

Yesterday, I used glitches to inject the source code for Flappy Bird into Super Mario World on SNES. Here‚Äôs how.
Amazing stuff. Roughly how many attempts did it take?  
I did it first try :) Of course that's after months of planning and practice.  
 after months of planning and practice  That is... dedication.  
As dedicated as this guy? He's dedicated years (I think) to beating Mario 64 without pressing the A button and has very detailed videos describing the most insane glitches.  But it's not on the level of injecting code, but still dedication.

Why are there all these glitches for this game?  Does every game have these weird code replacement things, and this game is just popular enough for lots of people to know about it? Is this game especially poorly-made? Can you explain again what the multitaps are doing, exactly?  
I would guess most SNES games are similarly glitchy, and Super Mario World is probably the best studied SNES game. The multitaps are used to direct the processor execution to the sprite x-coordinate table. We can manipulate the code path so that it reads instructions from controllers 3 and 4. Then those controllers have buttons pressed to jump to the right memory address where we can manipulate more bytes for a larger arbitrary code execution.  
I'm not a programmer, so please have patience with my (hopefully not dumb) question: As far as I understand it, controller ports 3 and 4 basically have buttons pressed that match the value of the beginning of a memory address large (and non-critical) enough to hold the Flappy Bird source code? Thus allowing you to write that data in with the jump-spins?  
Not quite. The controllers point to a memory address that contains the sprite x-coordinate table (for things like Koopas, Yoshi and P Switches). That table is then executed to write a single byte to an unused portion of RAM. And then again, and again. Until there are enough instructions to form the "Bootloader", which is a small bit of code that let me write bytes to another portion of RAM very quickly, with spin jumps. I used the bootloader to write the 331 byte payload.

I really need to learn Assembly. I'd love to understand this stuff because it's right up my alley, I love seeing things used in ways that are totally unexpected. This video is done nicely: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv0kZKC6GAM and I like the way he explains it. I wish I had the background to understand this Mario exploit but it's based on so many sub-glitches that it's all going over my head. I wish I could understand the whole thing from the bottom up, as this high level version sounds very interesting. Awesome video dude, keep it up.

I have nothing better to do so im going to try and explain how things like this work in general. Im not sure about the specifics of this mario exploit but this might give you a hint as to what happned in the computer. First you need to know how a CPU works which is quite simple. A working CPU needs two things. A list of instructions to run, a counter which keeps track of where in the list of instructions it is currently executing (the Program counter) and finally, something that can run the actual instructions. For this, you don't need to know how a specific instruction is executed. The list of instructions is usually stored in RAM. When the CPU is running, all it does is repeat the following process over and over again. Fetch the next instruction from memory, execute the instruction, fetch the next instruction. Again, we don't have to worry about how instructions are executed. I said before that instructions are stored in RAM and that the CPU has a program counter to keep track of which instruction is being executed. RAM is just a big list of bytes which can be read by an index. So in order to read what is in position X in ram, you give the RAM the value X, and get the content back. That way, all the program counter needs to store is the index of the current instruction being executed. In normal execution, the CPU runs an instruction, then adds 1 to the program counter which makes it run the next instruction in the list. Now we can have a computer which does something from the start until forever but in order to do something usefull, we need to be able to make descitions.  In order to do that, CPUs contain instructions that change the program counter. These are called jump or branch and can be conditional or unconditional. All they do is change the value of the program counter if a condition is met.  You need to know one more thing in order to understand how exploits like this work and that is how instructions are stored in memory. The simple answer to that is that they are just a series of bytes split into two parts. The last part is data given to the instruction, it is a set of bytes and differs between each instruction. The first part is also a set of bytes which is called the op code. Each instruction in the CPU has a unique op code that tells the CPU what to do. All the instructions are stored in RAM as bytes containing an op code and data for the instruction. CPU instructions are therefore just a set of bytes, just like numbers or any other data. The CPU doesn't know what the content of the RAM is for, all it knows about it is the values stored. This means that code being executed is not treated any differently to data in the RAM. Now that you know all this, you may be able to understand how code injection works. In order to get the CPU to execute our own code, we need to do two things. We need to put our code in RAM and then we need to set the program counter to the start of the code. Because the CPU treats data the same way it treats instructions, we can calculate some values that correspond to instructions and trick the CPU into putting those values in RAM in a place where we can get the CPU to jump to. The tricky thing is finding a way to write data to somewhere that the CPU will jump to. If we have done those two things, once the CPU fetches the next instruction it will run our code instead of whatever code caused the CPU to jump into it.  I may be entirely wrong about this, but it sounds like seth and his friends found a way to write the coordinates of things in the game into a part of memory where the CPU will jump to. Once the CPU jumps to that special piece of code, you can use it to tell it to jump to more code somewhere else in memory where you can write more code.  I should add that modern CPUs have some protections in place that prevents it from accidentally executing CPU instructions where they know that only data is stored so executing random code is harder. Computerphile made a really nice video where they demonstrate doing a similar attack. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S0aBV-Waeo

I'm pretty sure most of these glitches are different versions of a buffer overflow exploit.

Why are there all these glitches for this game?  Does every game have these weird code replacement things, and this game is just popular enough for lots of people to know about it? Is this game especially poorly-made? Can you explain again what the multitaps are doing, exactly?  
What they do with these exploits is actually quite similar to how modern systems get hacked. You take advantage of something like a buffer overflow, use-after-free condition, or poorly validated input to corrupt the program state in a way that you control. In this case, I think they exploit a use-after-free bug, which itself exists due to a race condition. It works something like:  By hitting the block with precise angle and timing, you can spawn several Yoshis at once. Normally if a Yoshi is already active, any new ones will spawn as 1ups instead, but if they're spawned quickly enough, they don't recognize the others and will spawn as Yoshi. If Yoshi runs off a pit while holding an object in its mouth, that object's memory is marked as free. However if you have multiple Yoshis spawned, you can still manipulate the object afterward, because all Yoshis share a single global variable pointing to the object they're holding. (Normally there can only be one Yoshi, so no problem.) You can exploit this by getting another object to spawn in that memory, which Yoshi's "object in mouth" variable still points to. Then when Yoshi spits out the object, it changes some variables in that memory. If that object isn't designed to be eaten, this change can corrupt its state. The game program later looks at the object's state and refers to a table of addresses where each state's code is located. If the object is in some corrupted state, then it's going to look past the end of that table into some other memory and try to run code from whatever arbitrary address it finds. Since most 8 and 16-bit consoles don't have any sort of memory protection or exception handling, it will go on trying to interpret whatever that memory holds as CPU instructions. Usually this leads to the game crapping all over itself and freezing up, but if you can control that memory, you can put some valid instructions there, and make the program do whatever you want. In this case, the corrupted state leads the game to read instructions from a memory region that holds controller input, so by holding the correct buttons on the controllers, you can control that memory and insert a few instructions to make the program do what you want and/or return to normal operation. Seth chains a few of these exploits together to corrupt Mario's powerup state, so the program jumps into some arbitrary memory - and ultimately to memory he can control - when obtaining a powerup. He writes a small program into an otherwise unused memory region, then takes advantage of the fact that this game stores some program instructions in RAM (where they can be changed). Patching those instructions lets him redirect the game program to the one he wrote without having to jump through all these hoops every time. Now he's fully taken over the game program and has it running a Flappy Bird clone instead.  A lot of games have these kinds of exploits, but it takes very precise timing and inputs to trigger them (so the original programmers didn't fix them because they went unnoticed or weren't worth the effort), and it takes a lot of skill and luck to be able to actually take over the program after triggering such a bug, instead of just having it get stuck in a loop and trash everything. You might like to look up some of the Pokemon examples. Those don't require precise timing, so they're easier to follow.

They often did a lot of tricks and shortcuts for games on earlier hardware to try and extract as much power/juice/performance as possible. A lot of times, this results in holes in how things are handled, because of how 'hacky' they programmed the game. They sacrifice checks for and validation of code for performance.

So since you had to eyeball the first 31 bytes, do you have all those locations memorized, or did you use pictures for reference?

Hi Seth. I'll have to give a full watch later, but after a few minutes of clicking through I have a question.  Is what you're doing possible to execute in the original, untouched hardware? i.e. Whether tools assisted in reading memory etc or not, would the same effect be achieved if you perfectly mimicked the actions on the original hardware/cart?

This is great! Have you ever considered implementing a hex editor using this glitch? I'm sure you could cram a simple one into some less than 300 bytes of RAM and use it to bootstrap a larger piece of code without the tedium of the current approach. Say, up/down to increment LS nybble, left/right to increment MS nybble, shoulder pads to move pointer. Of course, the current approach is superior on the showmanship side of things.

Noob Question: Could this be done, given enough time and knowledge of glitches, on other, more complicated systems?  In other words, can one inject arbitrary asm code, in this fashion, into pc using standard peripheries, without having to use compiler?  
Yeah if you can find a suitable point of entry. Which for complex systems is rather difficult, see previous and current gen consoles. Heh, even TI calculators.

You do a lot of arbitrary code execution stuff, particularly with SMW. Since you can inject code into the game, could you theoretically inject code that could fix some of the various bugs that SMW has? Not that anybody would want to. I just wonder if you could. I also have a degree in Computer Science, and studied some x86 assembly in school. While I found the language a nightmare to work with (mostly considering the hoops I had to go through to do the work on a Vista machine), the capabilities are impressive. Especially once I learned most/all older cartridge games were written in assembly. Great work regardless. Can't wait to see this demonstrated at SGDQ2016

Inject the source code you say? :P Anyway amazing achievement, and thanks for the detailed explanation!  
In this case the source was assembly... So, yes, the source code was injected, which also happens to be the code executed.  Edit: As /u/vawksel pointed out below for those who weren't aware, assembly is just human readable machine code and translates one-to-one with the instructions executed.

*machine code. assembly is a language, just like c or java or python.  
Assembly get's translated virtually one to one. From a human readable form into machine code. So you can literally count the number of clock cycles something will take the CPU to perform by reading your assembly source code. This is nearly impossible in C code, Java or Python. Also, you can usually convert the machine code back into the original assembly (minus the comments left in the code). You really can't do this with C code and end up with anything that looks remotely like the original C code. With Java, you can get code that looks much more similar to the original Java. With Python, it doesn't make sense because python is usually interpretted and executed from the source code level itself. In higher level languages, such as C, the code you write is translated into many assembly instructions (or direct to machine code). The code is also usually optimized, so much so, that sometimes the machine code does something you didn't consider at the higher level in C. For example, int x = 10 * 2; could result in a bit-wise shift left operator instead of a multiply instruction because the shift left operator is faster for the CPU to execute and with careful consideration by the compiler could 100% of the time produce the same results. With assembly, this is never the case. If you write a multiply instruction, the CPU will always perform the multiply.  Java code, which looks somewhat similar to C code to an untrained eye, will get compiled into Java Byte Code. This is Virtual Machine Code, instead of Native Machine Code. It's for the Java Virtual Machine to interpret and execute on a CPU. This is so that the Java Byte Code can run on many different architectures, platforms, or CPU types, and as long as a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) exists for that platform, the Java Byte Code can be executed. For example, you can run the same Java Byte Code or Java Program on a PowerPC Mac with a JVM as an x86 based Windows PC with a JVM. This is impossible with both an assembler program written for a specific CPU type, or a C program's binary output compiled for a specific CPU or platform. Python in it's standard use case, is interpreted at the source code level. A python interpreter program will more or less read the source code you wrote, character by character, and execute the code as soon as something meaningful to it has been read. This results in the slow execution versus Assembler, C or Java. There are compilers for Python which will create native binaries for specific CPU types, but they are used less commonly as far as I know.

VSTS competes with GH Enterprise.  I think they'd probably go the other way.  GH Enterprise users get migrated to VSTS.  Combine the backends.  Differentiate based on feature offering.  GH is for OSS, individuals and small teams that have simpler needs.  Leverage VSTS/Azure for an integrated CI/CD offering.  VSTS is for the medium to large companies that need a more sophisticated entitlements system, issue tracking and project management and the ability to do customizations.  Provide a simple migration path from GH to VSTS.  As a company grows, they have a clear and simple migration path for the Source Code, Issue Tracking and Project Management needs. As a someone who looked into GH Enterprise, the experience was pretty lackluster.  Their sales approach was basically "Take it or leave it, we don't care."  Which doesn't work if you work in a regulated industry and have to deal with things like SOX and BASEL II.    
I am willing to bet that they make VSTS more complex and leave GH as a simpler solution. And then allow "upgrading" your git to VSTS.

First, I'm not a fan of this aquistion for privacy reasons. But I don't see GH Enterprise getting shuttered. They just paid $7.5 billion for it. I would expect the Git part of VSTS replaced with GitHub Enterprise. Using GitHub is what draws developers in and if they make the jump to VSTS include GitHub Enterprise I think it would increase adoption.  From the press release it sounds like Microsoft wants to integrate GH Enterprise with more Microsoft services than Github.com. I would expect them to leave GitHub.com alone for the foreseeable future. They realize what's at stake; their reputation and if they "Skype" it up then the developers that still trust MS will leave for something else and MS will loose all the good will they've worked for recently and GitHub.com will cease to exist.

If anything, I find the kind of monopolistic culture we'd been having lately depressing given the federated/distributed nature of both the Web and git, and look forward to see real project web sites again.

They could probably do this and nobody would get it anyway. NT kernel is very likely to be among the most complicated and convoluted pieces of software to exist yet.  
I tried reading the Linux kernel once. It make no sense to me. I‚Äôve seen part of the Windows source while working for MS, and the experience was similar. If you‚Äôre not a kernel expert, it‚Äôs all gibberish C code. Microsoft can‚Äôt release Windows as OSS though, as it would be a massive issue due to intellectual property patents (software patents) Releasing patented code is a major hurdle for all FOSS software, and generally why legacy products aren‚Äôt released as open source.

The implication is that the Windows (NT) code is of low quality and filled with cruft. Having worked on the NT kernel in the past, he is not necessarily wrong. The code certainly tends to the pragmatic side.

The company where I work have a few open source initiatives and we prefer using open source tools, but the code base for our web based application is still proprietary as it obviously contains business secrets. I would view MS in the same way, they are still allowed to be open source enthusiasts.

Visual Studio is hands down the best C/C++ development environment in existence.   
I myself do most of my development under WPF/C#, and I absolutely LOVE Visual Studio. I've used it for plenty of other languages, too, and I always find it to be very intuitive. I've also done my fair share of Android development under Eclipse and Android Studio, as well as iOS development in Xcode.   Visual Studio feels miles ahead of those. I wonder sometimes, though, if that's true, or if I've just been using Visual Studio so often and so long that everything else is foreign. Android Studio is a HUGE improvement over Eclipse, though, and probably where I'm second most comfortable.   Xcode is... well, I hate it. I only work in it when my job forces me to, it feels completely scatterbrained, and at the time I worked in it Objective-C was the only option, and I found the language to be "dense" for lack of a better word. Now we have Swift and the app I'm supporting is in Objective-C and I don't feel like porting it, so I just glare at it angrily while I work.   But again, some of this may just be bias because Visual Studio is what I know the best.

Interesting that Chris became a Technical Fellow; that's the highest IC position and not the PM/manager track.   
Highest non-manager rank is "Senior Technical Fellow". As far as I know, the only one at the company is Dave Cutler, the architect for both the NT kernel and the initial launch of Azure. It's really a deceptive title though. Many of the people with titles like "Distinguished Engineer" and "Technical Fellow" aren't ICs at all. Many of them have 300+ person orgs reporting to them.

Sorry, but this is exactly the stuff you say no matter what.  As a company you might have already decided to tank the thing you bought absolutely into the ground.  It doesn't matter, you say this same bullshit.  It's a standard "Oh nothing's going to change", and you have the now child company say "Oh yes, as far as we know, nothing's changing."  I've seen this first hand at multiple places. I'm not saying it's duplicitous, I'm just saying anyone swayed by these words is naive.  Only the actions will tell.  
It‚Äôs likely they already calculated the resulting backlash into a percentage of users that are likely going to leave. Business these days is mad.

I wonder what will happen with https://github.com/atom/xray Personally, i don't care about Atom (i doubt MS will continue developing it), but xray looked promising. It would be nice if xray could be developed further as potential base for future versions of vs code.  
Is there any reason why you think they'd stop developing Atom? I mean sure it's a possibility but I can't understand the reasoning. It's not like VS Code is a paid solution. Continuing dvelopment of both (and maybe even having some cross compatibility regarding some "team" features" would only increase the marketshare of use.

Sarcasm or not, if someone has a grasp of engineering and networking on the level of being able to architect a viable solution to something like this that is implementable, they should be making $460k a year. Like, you offer me 460k and ask me to move a mountain, Sure, I'll try to get it done but I'm not going to put all my efforts into it, I don't see the return to the amount of time spent on it to be worth it. 2 million is probably low balling it honestly.

 ...arbitrary standards body...  Like Microsoft, Apple, Google, or Mozilla? Seriously, any one of the four could bake support into browsers, and let the user's marketplace sort out the winners and losers. It's not always ideal, but it's certainly better than letting ideas rot on the vine while committees tilt at windmills.

 Now all we need is some arbitrary standards body we've given authority to, WC3 or something, to pick and choose which standards to promote, and we'll be there.  Hold on just a minute. The point of a decentralized web is that there WOULDNT be a third party to promote it. That's literally the core definition of decentralized. And therein lies the pproblem. Nobody to advocate except the people themselves. Ethereum or meshnet don't work unless EVERYBODY whose capable of doing so does. That's insanely difficult to do, and the reason a 2mil bounty is up.

Ironic. Decentralization only available to the nation that everything is centered around..   
 Ironic    They could decentralize the Internet, but not themselves.  
Is it possible to learn such power?

Yeah, the whole phones thing is so silly, due to battery and data usage. Meanwhile we basically all have desktops and laptops plugged into a wall 99% of the time, on 24/7, and on a higher speed more reliable connection.

That's a bit surreal since one of the underpinnings of the Internet and the way it was designed was to be decentralized. Interestingly, because of the era of when all this started to take form, the main motivation for a decentralized Internet was driven by the fear of a nuclear strike knocking off the servers. If the network is designed to move packets from node to node dynamically so that it would automatically route around destroyed sections, then it becomes impossible to shut it down other than destroying most of the country. I've read the article and the motivation behind this initiative and I'm still at a loss about what they think that can come out of this project that's fundamentally different from the way the Internet already works today.  
It sounds like they're talking about peer-to-peer grid networks, i.e. getting rid of ISPs.  
How do you cross the oceans in a peer-to-peer grid network?  Like in silicon valley, the idea is to use smartphones as nodes, but what about in poorly populated areas where the distance between nodes is large, and what about the oceans?  Who controls the node that connects to the transpacific/transatlantic cable and who owns the cable?  
The cable should be owned and regulated like the pipes that bring water to your house and we should only be charged enough to cover workers, power, maintenance, and upgrading the network. No profits, no executives making millions per year, no lobbying billions per year, etc.

you pay a small amount of a crypto coin to move data, and for each leg. You pay more to prioritize your data more.  People who provide and hook up infrastructure can charge crypt as they choose, although the system chooses the cheapest and best route.   Cables will be built when it's worth it to build cables because people will pay for it.  This is economics 2.0 type stuff and it's going to happen in a big way. If I build a laser link across a city that skips a lot of junk in between, I can sell that.  If I have an LTE repeater that is providing cell service for people, they can pay a little bit of crypt to use that.  This will enable phone plans that cost dollars per month instead of hundreds, depending on usage.  This model will drive data price down to cost. Decentralized, end to end encrypted, and cheap.  These systems ARE possible and they are the telecoms and governments worst nightmare.  
It sounds like they're talking about peer-to-peer grid networks, i.e. getting rid of ISPs.  
Sort of.  It looks like they want to do away with centralized authorities.  Their website makes it hard to understand what they're wanting, because of things like  Chinese, Spanish, Arabic and Portuguese speaking internet users make up 37.5% of the total online population, but only 11% of the Web is in their language.  So...what needs to be done to remedy that, exactly?  
People who speak those languages need to become content providers and programmers.  
It sounds like they're talking about peer-to-peer grid networks, i.e. getting rid of ISPs.  
Someone needs to maintain the cables/wireless connection points to enable the p2p connections. So we'd eventually choose a certain group of people to do so, then it might eventually become privatized again and then we're back where we started.   
The need for this becomes less in presence of a mesh based internet. This would be really high latency compared to the backbone, but as long as you could get the data eventually it would be worth it. Then, only those that needed low latency access would need to deal with isps  
It sounds like they're talking about peer-to-peer grid networks, i.e. getting rid of ISPs.  
But what about today's IP stack prevents that?  We already have multiple P2P ways of sharing information.  And we've already discovered that centralising data is a good thing because it allows us to focus infrastructure improvements and it's beneficial from a security perspective, in having 'trusted authorities'*. I also don't get the Silicon Valley meme of using phones.  Like sure, but you're just replacing ISPs with wireless carriers.  Fundamentally it isn't any different.  If the idea is a mesh of a low-range radios, the latency is going to be shit anyways and a single node can break a network with poor routing decisions. * whether you can actually trust them or not is a different problem

The internet is decentralized at the level of major Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs, and other large institutional users who can afford to run their own AS (autonomous system). If you can afford the hardware and IT resources to run an AS, and participate in BGP peering, then you can be peered with multiple different providers over multiple physical lines, and if one goes down, the packets will be routed over a different network and still reach you. So the internet is decentralized and robust enough for large ISPs, universities, the military, Google, big data centers, and so on to remain online despite outages. For the end user, there's generally a reliance on a single, centralized ISP over a single line. If that ISP goes down, or that line is cut, you lose access. Even if you potentially have access to more than one ISP (DSL and cable say, or your landline and mobile connections), your house is not an AS, so you can't have the same IP address space routed via both connections. If one goes down, and you reconnect with the other, you'll have new IP addresses, which means that if you were running any servers at home, you'll have to update your DNS and people won't be able to access it until that DNS propagation occurs. Furthermore, many people in the US don't have access to even one broadband ISP. There are a lot of people living in rural areas in the US, where the only options may be dialup or satellite. So this initiative seems to be about ways to work around those issues; provide more robust and reliable access for home users in circumstances in which their only provider may be out, or in which they don't have access to wired broadband providers in the first place, and the capital costs of laying out a new FTTH network may be excessive.  
 Even if you potentially have access to more than one ISP (DSL and cable say, or your landline and mobile connections), your house is not an AS, so you can't have the same IP address space routed via both connections. If one goes down, and you reconnect with the other, you'll have new IP addresses, which means that if you were running any servers at home, you'll have to update your DNS and people won't be able to access it until that DNS propagation occurs.  Mobile IP solves this.  It does have some overhead, but surely the overhead is less than forcing every single end-user to run their own AS!

The actual name of the project is "Wireless Innovation for a Networked Society (WINS) Challenges". I'm not sure why they're talking about "decentralization" in that article. It's meant to give Internet access to people in the US, which apparently not everybody has.  We are seeking solutions to connect the unconnected. The Wireless Innovation for a Networked Society (WINS) Challenges, run by Mozilla and sponsored by the National Science Foundation, seek practical, new wireless solutions that will help connect people to the Internet in challenging circumstances: after a disaster or in areas without sufficient connectivity. We‚Äôre seeking wireless technology innovations that will make the Internet more accessible, resilient, and healthier.  This has nothing to do with TCP/IP or routing:  Here‚Äôs an example: A backpack containing a hard drive computer, battery and Wi-Fi router. The router provides access, via a Wi-Fi network, to resources on the hard drive like maps and messaging applications.

The Internet was designed to be decentralised, but it isn't. It isn't viable to run cables between every single node in the network, so we centralise the cables into trunks. It isn't viable to have one worldwide trunk, so we segment the trunks into different ISPs. Building undersea cables is really expensive, though, so we're only gonna do a few of them. Making all this hardware work securely is impossible, so we build a bunch of centralised certificate authorities to tell us who to trust. Making routing work is really hard, so we centralise the configuration of that, and now it's easy for state actors to block access to particular nodes - so easy it has happened accidentally on many occasions.  The Internet is really quite centralised. There's single figures of root DNS server, vast swathes of the world which only get one ISP, our entire security model is based on centralisation, and global communications are extremely centralised. I can almost guarantee that my message got to you by going over a specific cable, because there's very few routes between the UK and the US which have the bandwidth to actually satisfy demand.

Mozilla is offering $2 million of you can architect a plan to decentralize the web
I think the term they meant to use was "a new Uncentralizable web". Any effort spent on decentralizing this web will only be immediately undone by the government and authorities in power now who want to centralize it.  What we need is a web that has builtin a little piranha that bites off the fingers of anyone who even begins to attempt to centralize it, leaving little bloody stump, as a warning to others who like to think that they are God and that they own the internet and the right to discriminate and charge people based on what they think and what they do.

That's exactly what I was thinking... It seems like there is already at least one solution out there. I've used ipfs net, and it worked very well for me.  
So does it work without an ISP?

Can someone ELI5 what they mean by decentralize?  
Right now if you want to load Reddit and its data, its hosted on their servers. This would get rid of servers and everything would be hosted on everyone's devices by storing little chunks of data. So if you wanted to load Reddit it would come from multiple devices all over the internet rather than one centralized server.  
Is that good or bad?  
Both. Could in theory provide faster more stable internet. For example, reddit getting overloaded and shutting down less often or giving smaller sites "hug of death". Also good if you're worried about big government meddling with the web. It would be harder to control and monitor data. Bad because everyone needs to "share" to make it effective. So if your devices are serving up data for everyone else, you better hope you don't have a datacap. Or youll be paying for other people's browsing. Or your phone battery draining while it shares it's chunks of data. These are very simple examples and just scratch the surface. But I think its important to note for a decentealized system to work, it would require a lot of cooperation between ISPs changing and individual people sharing. Neither of which has a history of going well.  
Is that good or bad?

I think the root of it all is hardware infrastructure.  A well functioning decentralized internet is only possible if there is great abundance of high bandwidth servers. Kind of like internet back bones of today, only with large amount of redundancy. That's only possible if governments decide to use tax dollars to fund construction of such networks for benefit of all Even then, you'd need some regulatory agencies to make sure bad actors don't simply flood the network with bad data to deny service to others.  
I agree that the key is the network hardware itself. Possibly when wireless becomes both directed, not broadcast, and the bandwidth is high enough, you can use all connected devices in a mesh network with some onion routing on top.  
[deleted]  
I think what they are getting at is the issues of interference and scheduling in wireless communications. E.g. If I have 1000 machines in a datacenter, I can connect them up with some switches and ethernet and they can use close to link speed constantly. Broadcast wireless devices don't really work this way. When one is transmitting, others can't really transmit at the same frequency. So 1000 devices in the same room will be communicating at 1/1000 link speed on average by taking turns on one frequency. While you can just buy more cables and switches, you eventually can't just add more frequencies (there is limited spectrum available for public use and the rest is expensive). Directed transmission could potentially help by having multiple nearby devices use the same frequency at the same time without interfering. I guess the idea is like having a lot of point to point links that dynamically point at each other and schedule to not use the same frequencies as overlapping links.  
[deleted]  
I mean access points that talk to each device by having directed beams to each client (and each client having a directed bran back). I don't know how access points are defined by broadcasting traffic either? Other than broadcasting it's location, what data does it send that are interesting for all clients?

Legit question: why should I use your course over something like The Odin Project or Free Code Camp?  Obviously youll be a little biased as you built this whole course, but curious if there is a reason to choose one over the other based on some fundamental difference.   
I love both of those projects and think they're doing wonderful things. I think one of the main differences is that this course is dense in rich media format (i.e. video-based lessons). To be able to hear an instructor (me) describe concepts in multiple ways, while sharing my screen with a student (you) makes learning to code very efficient and allows you to understand the key concepts from multiple angles. That said, the best part of learning online is that you can use many resources, so I encourage students to use any quality resources they can find.  
How come you're giving this free? Not that it's a bad thing or anything I just want to know your thought process  
If he's been on a programmer's salary for 30,000 students' worth of courses, perhaps he's simply got enough. Some people see value in a world of sharing, and such people have my respect! Thanks, /u/robeendey.

I am a comp sci major and I have been studying java for the past 3 semesters and have absolutely no idea what I am doing. (Either because i am not interested/motivated/ or i don't know why) I am VERY interested in this course however, I have one quick question: Would this course help me in my future with learning java and C etc for school and some type of development? Sorry in advance for the possible ignorance in my comment :(  
I've had a lot of comp sci majors take my courses and say that it helped them. Think of this course as a practical guide to real-world web development (i.e. things you'd be tasked to do at a job). While learning data structures and algorithms is important, this course helps to fill in the gaps by applying those concepts directly to real-world projects.  
thank you very much for your reply! I have trouble focusing in class as all i see is code yet i have no idea what its actually doing. It seems like this course will show me directly that coding is actually creating something rather than memorizing how data structures work without knowing why and for what. Thank you very much for the free resource.  Should I make an account or how would I go about using it properly. I hope you are making some sort of return off of this being free as you are helping so many people!  
Awesome. Yea, just make a free account and the course is yours forever.

I am returning to school for an IT degree in Health Informatics.  It looks like they will have me study C#/SQL/MS Visual Studio.  I glanced at the course material and wonder if there is value for me to consume the content even if the syntax is not exact?  Or would it be better to to stay away to avoid confusion in my little brain? As others have mentioned - thank you for sharing!  I won't be taking my classes for another year but I am trying to get ahead of the curve by studying free content now so I can might hit the ground running.

I signed up for your website/bootcamp when you posted a thread a few weeks ago. I got the first month for free but then $25/month afterward. Has that changed? Will I not be charged anymore. Sorry for my ignorance but this confused me a bit.

So like a lot of people probably, I've wondered how much I need to learn before I can get paid to code.  If I master everything here, would I be ready to apply for a job and would I get fired instantly lol.  
I think you would be ready to take those projects on, yes. Though getting a job really would depend on what the employer is looking for. There is always an option to freelance until you feel comfortable enough on your own to apply for a job.    
How do you freelance? I work as an application developer...not sure how to get started freelancing  
You can go to this website, sign up for free (and yes, there is a paid account option, which has more options, but you don't need to have it necessarily), and start looking for projects that you are interested in.

I'm confused.  I think a few months ago, the only offering on upskill was the essential full stack web development course, I think I picked it up on a discount from slashdot.  http://upskillcourses.com/courses lists 3 courses, so which of the ones are you now offering for free?   The entry for the bootcamp seems to be an overview of the course material present in the "essential web dev" course, so what is going on here?  Thank you. edit: on second thought, how is this different than your offering on codermanual?  
Seems like every month or so this guy re-markets himself. Now that this post was successfully popular, the next post will be "I taught 50,000 students how to code".

looks awesome. what is your background? and what kinds of things can one expect to be able to do after going through your course? edit: oh wow after going through it, I remember buying this course a while back. how come you decided to change it up to free?>  
I come from a web development background: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, PHP, MySQL. Nice to bump into someone who has taken my courses before. This is a complete rewrite of a similar course I created in the past. It's also nearly twice as long. Why make it free? I think the real question is: why not make it free?

Weird question, but is anyone else having issues with watching some of the videos? I love the way this is structured, but for some reason, some of the videos, mainly in the intro section, stop or stall and don't really continue even though they've streamed quite a bit. Is this because of traffic, perhaps?

Would you consider adding the option to collapse the left hand panel that lists the lessons? I only have a single monitor to work with so I'd like to have my screen split so that my browser occupies the left half while the editor is on the right. This way I can have a better view of the video.

I'm in the same situation. Just make the page as big as possible and drag the left half off the screen. I don't know how big your monitor is, but this works well with my 27". I can read everything and follow along well.

I ran a 100% free full stack web development bootcamp for those laid off by the pandemic. 65 people got jobs and we are doing it again! I would love to have you join us!
HEY LEON!  I am an alumni of his previous cohort and I literally work as a senior front-end Dev now from 0 coding knowledge! I am down to field any questions anyone might have about the program from the perspective of a student! Some background:  I went to school originally for biochemistry and medicine‚Ä¶but I fucking hated it. So I dropped out senior year, and have lived in Miami in a side house since 2019. My previous job was literally an overnight security guard at a busy Miami hotel making $14 an hour. My current job pays a little shy of 6 figures USD. It Took me from October 2020 to October 2021 to land my current position, lots of grinding, and a LOT of rejections. Edit: Woah. Did not expect this reception. I notice some dm‚Äôs and comments wondering about how it‚Äôs possible and how I did it.  Guys, it‚Äôs not magic I worked my absolute ass off. No matter what Leon teaches you, it‚Äôs going to be a LOT of work. Like let me not beat around the bush, Leon provides guidance, but you‚Äôre gonna have to push this boulder up the hill yourself.  But to stop nagging you and show some work I‚Äôve done check out my portfolio site at:  Amjadeportfolio.herokuapp.com I also love teaching so I wrote articles on my personal blog at: CodeMonkeyCove.com My old freelance company is: PuffinDesignLab.com My Twitter (as vacant as it is) is: Twitter.com/amjastplayin  
Hey, do you think this is feasible for people outside of US, example in the EU? In regards to the houses, you have to attend the classes even if your in different time zones? Appreciate any answers, glad to hear this helped you change your life in a positive way!  
Hey Radiance! Absolutely, there were actually a good amount of people in our cohort that were not stationed in the US.  In our Cohort, every class was recorded, so as long as you communicate that it is inconvenient for you to attend the classes in real-time you will be fine! But you can ask questions in real time so it would be helpful. if you join the discord, I would be happy to connect you directly with people who are non-US and what their strategies were!

Senior? Whoa, that's crazy, and if u really really had 0 knowledge is mind blowing, but I believe u, accountability is what really matters, congrats dude! That timelapse (oct 20-oct 21) was from starting the bootcamp till land a job? Or was  your search for a job only? And just to clarify, u took the free bootcamp or a paid one of Leon? Sorry for my bad English:(  
Yup! Believe it or not, it‚Äôs a senior role. That‚Äôs the disconnect. People think that in the process of GETTING A JOB that hard skills 100% translate to your job title.  But I‚Äôd say If you can split your time between how you network and in using the right channels to share the projects and skills you hone, I‚Äôd say the soft skills probably matter a tad more. Devs who don‚Äôt know how to network or how to passively attract attention to their progress and projects are the ones who make those graphs showing all the thousands of apps they submitted and show less than 5% responses. I don‚Äôt just ‚Äúhit apply‚Äù. The whole bootcamp took me 1 year but you will begin applying to jobs way before the end.  Now how did I get this job? Literally was contacted by a recruiter who set me up with a single 30 minute interview with the person who is now my team lead, and we meshed so well that I didn‚Äôt have to even go through the technical round. This took me 8 months of growing my network and failed interviews, but it is very possible, but between the freelance work I was frantically doing to get by, my current work pays way better but is much laxer.  But as Leon will tell you, ‚Äúif you are just hitting apply, you might as well throw your application straight in the trash‚Äù (Keep in mind as well, I was furloughed and this career choice was a huge Hail Mary I dedicated ALL my time into and developing. This was literally about survival for me)  
How did this recruiter know you? LinkedIn?

If you want to learn to code, this will change your life. Can't make it to class? Recorded classes are on Twitch and YouTube Never touched code before? He starts from square 1! Shy/introvert/don't like talking? Stick to the chat Don't have support in real life? Join the discord and get more support and hype than your family Don't have money? It's free! Not in the US? Leon is Mr. Worldwide when it comes to teaching! 100Devs isn't just a free online bootcamp, it's a whole support network that will be there for you to cheer you on, help you out, and give you a shoulder to cry on.

If you want to learn to code, this will change your life. Can't make it to class? Recorded classes are on Twitch and YouTube Never touched code before? He starts from square 1! Shy/introvert/don't like talking? Stick to the chat Don't have support in real life? Join the discord and get more support and hype than your family Don't have money? It's free! Not in the US? Leon is Mr. Worldwide when it comes to teaching! 100Devs isn't just a free online bootcamp, it's a whole support network that will be there for you to cheer you on, help you out, and give you a shoulder to cry on. If you're on the fence, give it a try. You won't regret it.  
Posts like this make me wonder if going back to university was the right choice... but im also majoring in artifical intelligence so it might do me better than a full stack or data science bootcamp

If you need any free dev help let me know I was also a teacher for 15 years before coding if that's helpful too  
We can always use the help! Really appreciate it. I'll follow up with a dm. Cheers!

I‚Äôm a former head of HR and now I‚Äôm an executive recruiter, dm me, I‚Äôll take a look at your resume and give you interview tips as well. Happy to help any way I can.

Hey guys, I was one of the 65! I wasn't as active in chat as I should've been and mostly watched the replays within a day or two - but I landed a full stack position before it was over (not entry level even)! Coming from a limited tech work history, this was seriously a blessing. And Leon is just..he's the person you want explaining this. Every concept is like a little hug from him. I haven't taken a moment to thank you Leon, my life really 180'd when you reached out to me about this initially. Cheers man.

With Leon's help, I doubled my salary and changed careers. He's never asked for a dime- just that I help other people where I can. 100% legend and a GORGEOUS head of hair. Leon also has great music taste, cute dogs, and at some point might even start an OnlyFans.

 85% of our graduates, most of whom do not have degrees or prior experience, go on to get full time offers at an average starting salary of $98,000.   How do you help them get to that point once they're through the bootcamp? Is it the projects done during the course to place on their resume, and/or helping them make those connections to get the interviews at all?  Do you guys work with specific companies or recruiting agencies?  
The Resilient Coders bootcamp is extremely intense. Like 12 hour days with no breaks for 20 weeks intense. By the end our students are lean mean coding machines, but they also have committed to serious networking each and every week. When they graduate they all have a completed fullstack project that they built on their own from scratch, a network of 100+ people in their area, paid clients, meticulous resumes, portfolios, ect... Plus we have staff whose job it is to bring employers to the table to meet our students as well. It took a long time to get to where we are with that program, but the results have been pretty amazing.

No, PLEASE take a break at the top of every hour at least. I meant like no spring break or long weekends.

Do not hesitate this is real. 100Devs is a thousand times better than a paid Bootcamp and more responsive than any college program. I tried both and 100Devs is the best.

We do live classes twice a week. Those classes last 3 hours with breaks every hour. Most folx will spend an extra 10 hours a week outside of class completing the homework, working on projects, and networking. Some do way more and some do less.    We use a lot of resources for homework, but I only ever share resources that are free and open to all.    Happy to answer any other questions!  
Can peeps not selected participate alongside?

I stumbled on v1 of this post in the fall of 2020 and was about 75% convinced that I was falling prey to some silly scam. I signed up anyway, because I was pretty desperate. I had just turned 34 and was working in landscape construction making $40k a year in California, meaning I was trapped in the paycheck-to-paycheck grind. Always had been, figured I always would be. Less than a year later, I landed a job doing marketing and developer advocacy (What is that? Read about it here) for a tech startup and more than doubled my annual income. Between my day job and my freelancing side hustles, I'm on track to break six figures in my first year in tech. I kind of can't believe it. I've been painfully broke for my entire adult life, until now. And this is just the beginning of my new career. Leon gave me the structure and the confidence I needed to see this seemingly impossible sea change through. Don't get me wrong, I put in the work. A loooooot of work. I woke up at 4 am every day for months to study before my 9-5 shoveling gravel and digging trenches. It was so, so, so worth it. 100devs changed my life in ways I'm still reckoning with. I want this so badly for everyone who has stumbled upon this post like I did last year. Sign up! Do what Leon says. He knows how to get you a job. It works. Believe me. You can do this.  
This one resonates with me alot. Im a carpenter (framer) and I don't make much doing this either. I want out badly and am so grateful for this bootcamp coming up. Thanks for this post I'm glad it worked out for you !

I was taught by Leon in both 100Devs and Resilient Coders. Life changing is an understatement. I started my year making LESS THAN 30,000. I currently make more than 3x that at FAANG and guess what? My little bro just also received his second offer. Right in time for the holidays. I cannot recommend 100Devs enough. Leon is the best educator I‚Äôve had in my life and the 100Devs community is fantastic. I am happy to answer any questions!

Signed up for reddit just to comment on this! I was part of the first cohort, and one of the 65 (#23 maybe? I forget) to get jobs so far, and can vouch that this course is 100% the real deal. Prior to bootcamp I had dabbled a little bit with code over the years, but never got past basic for-loops. I went through this bootcamp while locked in my house with my 2 small boys + husband during the pandemic, and it was a lot of work but SO worth it.  Before bootcamp I had been a stay at home mom for almost 6 years, and never really had any sort of career before - just jobs to pay the bills that I hated every moment of. Now I have a whole career ahead of me and a position where I'm appreciated. Leon is an amazing instructor, the live classes are fantastic for someone with attention/commitment problems like I have. I felt engaged and on-track throughout the course, which is huge for me. Usually keeping myself motivated beyond a few weeks is a gigantic challenge. What else can I say? It's all 100% free, that's no joke, and though Leon's drawing skills are pitiful, it's worth every second of your time.

My current work schedule should allow me to attend Sundays and Thursdays but Tuesday evening I work. I'd feel bad signing up if it means taking a spot from someone who can attend all the classes. I subscribed on YouTube, and joined the discord. Should I do anything else? What's a good prep for the upcoming boot camp?  
Still join us! We have many folx that have to catch up with the VODs (each class is immediately available after the live stream). If you did those things, you should be all set!   Also, my advice to prep is to spend time with your loved ones during the holidays because your time will be at a premium during bootcamp. No need to prepare anything code related just come as you are and ready to put in work :)  
I work until 5PM Pacific on Tuesday and Thursday but you‚Äôre saying it would be okay to enroll and just do the VOD after the session has ended?  I have full availability Sundays.

I started on my own a few months ago using your recorded classes and am waiting for the next cohort to start.  I can't thank you enough for what you've done for me!  
That is awesome! Where are you in the recorded classes? Excited to have you join us live!  
I'm at (funnily enough) winter break.  Doing the 30 mini JS projects and then on to class 14.  I already applied for a job because all they require is CSS,HTML, and JS, so I figured, why not?  I will not get 100% of the jobs I don't apply for.

Hey Leon! I would love to join but if I cannot this time, do you think if I were to go through all your videos from last year's bootcamp on YouTube, will it be likely that I will still be prepared enough to get a job? Hopefully this isn't a silly question.

I am currently learning java, would it be wise to take this bootcamp alongside that? because I am pretty deep with java  
Really is up to you and what you want. We teach full stack JS because after helping hundreds of folx get jobs I find it really is the easiest stack to land a job with at the moment. Your Java experience would help and I think you would get a lot out of the bootcamp that is not just learning how to code. We spend a lot of time teaching how to learn, network, and ultimately get a job. JS is just a tool on our toolbelt that helps us land jobs.

Hey Leon, thank you for doing this! I would like to join the cohort but I cannot commit to the class meeting times unfortunately. I have been following your YouTube videos from last year. Would I be able to do the same for this year's lectures? Will they available on twitch perhaps as soon as you conduct them? I would like to do as best as I can to do the bootcamp with the time I can spare, I believe you had different houses for different levels of commitment, is that not happening this go around? Thank you!  
Yep! The classes are always immediately available on Twitch and 24 hours later they will be on youtube. We are doing houses again and to apply to Turing you just have to submit a video when you submit the form. We'll also be creating a Discord channel specifically for folx who are following at their own pace, so you will have that community too!

Just looked at the course description on your site. Is this just for black and brown folx exclusively? And only those affected by the pandemic?  
I'm white, was not affected by the pandemic, was not "officially enrolled", but joined the Discord and watched the stream. The only difference between being "enrolled" or not is having Leon personally review your work/portfolio. If you think you don't "meet" the requirements you can (and should) still unofficially join.

Between my current job and prior commitments, I likely wouldn't be able to reliably commit to keeping up with this real time. How much is lost by trying to follow along on youtube (at a slower pace) vs. being in the live sessions?

Please spend more time on back end and OOP, seeing how many applicants we're getting that don't know much about those is really disheartening

Hey Leon! It kinda feels like a sign that this popped up on my feed today because I've been considering learning how to code for a while now.  I got laid off at the beginning of the pandemic which led to me landing in something I'm not really sure is the path for me.  Been thinking a lot recently about where to go from here.  Is it too late for me to start at the age of 35? What's the deadline to apply, is it first come first serve?  Thanks for doing this!

Reality Check: Most of the claims in this post are exaggerations at best, and flat out lies at worst. I am a senior engineer of over two decades working for a multinational company. Nobody we interview and hire would be coming solely from a free web seminar. Basic requirements are a degree from an accredited university or equivalent demonstrated work experience with references, or both. The salaries claimed here are absolutely unreasonable in most areas of the US for entry-level, and certainly not without a degree. Furthermore, the language and nuances demonstrated here indicate a heavy reliance on social manipulation techniques to convince you there‚Äôs nothing to lose. Your time is valuable. Your personal information is valuable. And although the actual knowledge may or may not be accurate, it is very easy to teach bad coding practices and shortcuts. Nothing worth your time is easy, or free. If monetary concerns are your primary blocker, try free courses through many of the accredited universities first, and then see what your local community college can offer. Many times you will be able to attend for free due to grants and incentives in your area, and you will walk away with a real degree. It‚Äôs not a bad thing to be skeptical of a free lunch being hustled at you like a TV infomercial. Remember cults always look like a great deal‚Ä¶ until you‚Äôre drinking the koolaid.  I‚Äôm sure this post will be downvoted, buried or removed because it challenges the narrative, but I hope it saves one person the disappointment.  
Also a reality check for you: I‚Äôve done a program similar to this. No one had degrees. 20-30 people were hired (out of 60-80) immediately out of the program by Virgin, Johnson&Johnson and/or Fidelity as junior programmers making $40k for 3 months part time, then $80k after that training period. I think your ‚Äú20 years‚Äù in the business may have aged you out of understanding how this works these days.  Degrees don‚Äôt mean shit if you can‚Äôt code, and no company, even Fortune 500, turns away people who can just because they don‚Äôt have a degree. That‚Äôs ancient thinking. Edit: I do think this post reeks of self-promotion for that guy who literally used a picture of his face for the lead photo, and he‚Äôs making it all sound very straightforward when it‚Äôs not. But it‚Äôs entirely legitimate if you apply yourself and work hard.

I currently work in a GTM role at a SaaS company, and I‚Äôm interested in getting more exposure to the technical side of things. I‚Äôll plan to follow along ‚Äúunofficially‚Äù - excited to check out the course :)

My brain zeroed in on this very aggressively so i need to ask. Why did you spell 'folx' once like that? It seems intentional.  
It is short, inclusive, and avoids the gang affiliated folks

What about burned out nurses who‚Äôve seen enough over these last two years and want a change? Is there a qualification for that in the applicant process?  If so, how could one best prepare for this class? Any specifics that need downloading, or sites that should be joined! Thanks!  
If you send me a DM on Discord, I will help you get going personally. You are exactly who I want in the program.    The best way to prepare is to spend time with your loved ones and relax as much as possible before program starts as time will be at a premium once you begin!

It's an incredibly supportive discord, well worth hopping on to see what the fuss is about. I'm looking forward to the next cohort as the community he has established really shines a.light on mental health during the process.

This seems like a scam, the sheer amount of activity on this post (compared to the rest of the sub) is absurdly high.  It has become the top post of all time in under 24 hours and many of these comments leaving ‚Äúpositive reviews‚Äù were all posted within the first hour of this post going up.  Just seems kinda crazy, I would love to be proven wrong

Hi Leon,  I found you from Twitter and excited to start with you and the community on Jan 11. My question is about the Houses. How is it decided if someone should be in House Turing or Hopper?  Regardless on what house I'm in, thanks for doing something like this for BIPOC  
Everyone that completes the signup form and submits the 2 minute video are in the running for House Turing. I'm prioritizing folx laid off during the pandemic. I'll take as many as I can reasonably support and the rest will be placed into Hopper. No need to sweat though, because you can always use channel points to get the same benefits!

Hi Leon, I've been really debating getting into the programming field, and this seems like a great time. However I'm entering with very minimal prior experience. When you say "no technical experience", do you really mean no technical experience? I'd hate to apply for this with only a basic intro to Java programming class from college a few years ago, and realize I need a much more solid foundation.  Also, I applaud you for focusing on getting underrepresented people into the field, and I don't want to make sure I'm not out of line while applying: Is this course open to strictly under represented POC, or could a white male who is currently unhappy in their current job such as myself apply?

Any chance we can get accessibility service for this, such as sign language interpreting or captioning for your courses? I would absolutely love to participate but automated captioning is not that reliable and tend to miss a lot of information.

Was on the brink of ending it all  
Me too man, with all the people saying it's rigged ohh it's saturated, I was like whats the point and thats me I'm very young and hardworking. Fuck this I'll delete reddit and just fucking focus.  
Hang in there, saturated with shitty devs is exactly right. I can only speak for myself, but I think algo problems are useful--not for making sure you can "think right" or get an answer, but because they will expose people who don't really understand how to construct a loop or access the second to last letter of a string, etc. All I'm looking for in a junior is a solid grasp of the fundamentals and enough HTML/CSS/framework stuff to be dangerous, and it's surprising how many candidates--even those who supposedly have a couple of years experience--can't show it.

My question is: can anyone be a good dev? I've been working as a dev for a year and I think I'm shitty dev and that I will never be good at it. So I'm thinking to quit.  But good for you. Dev career is a great place with lots of oportunities for those who can actually know how to code.  
It is important to keep in mind that imposter syndrome is real and also very difficult to self diagnose. This is why asking for feedback is important. I imagine you are a junior dev so you should hopefully have a senior or tech lead type person you can go to. I have a Jr dev on my team who thinks very low of himself despite my encouragement due to a heavy case of imposter syndrome. But he builds out great solutions and I very much trust his judgment. This career rewards tenacity and dedication in spades. To answer your question yes anyone can become a good developer. Very few take to it naturally, and I say this as someone who did a ton of tutoring/teaching both academically and professionally. The job will have you learning throughout the entire course of your career. The "bad" developers are usually people who become complacent or stagnant in a space that required more momentum and continued learning. No where is this more intense than in your years as a junior. The problems you tackle as you grow do tend to be more complex but done so with a good deal of experience that allows you to brake things down into small solved issues. The areas where I see the most Jrs struggle are:  Tacking an issue all at once   It pays to brake some of the bigger problems down to workable components. many times I see young devs get into coding with out doing this.  Poor debugging skills   This comes with time, but there are many resources to help you along the way as you develop the tools needed to tackle some of the more tricky situations that come up. I usually start wide and then start isolating code till I get as close as possible to where the bug starts. The debugger wont always just point it out. Most of the nastiest bugs are logic bugs.  Google is a good friend for some of the more common issues.  Asking for help too soon or to late   This one is a hard balance, but anytime you hit a wall try to use it as a learning opportunity. This can't always be this way, especially if there are time constraints. The same way you don't want to consistently hit up your senior/tech lead for every little thing, bashing your head against a problem for hours is also not great. Suggestion here would be to just talk this out with who ever is responsible for your growth on the team. (Be it officially or unofficially) In my case I tell my Jr's to just hit me up and I will let them know if they should dig deeper or if it's something I know they wont find quickly. I tend not to just outright give them the answer but help them think through it.   Not giving yourself enough time   Unless it is the first hour of the morning, and you already know how to fix/do what is being asked. Never utter the words "I will get it done today" unprompted. You will never know what will hit you that day or the thing you need to do could end up being more time consuming.  Not working on your writing skills   This stuff is fundamentally essential to not just creating amazing documentation, your team will love you for; It also helps getting your point across in the many many many many many emails you will need to write.  While on communication! Work these soft skills out   Actively listening is very important. I have seen people with lesser technical skills beat out others for a job/promotion due to their ability to communicate. This happens, don't let that be you.  Last but certainly not lest. Continue learning   This tends to be more relevant to people shifting up from a Jr position, where everyday is learning, to a more advanced role. Just always keep learning, if not for fun than at lest to support the environment you develop in.   Enjoy the vast amount of unsolicited advice from someone who should have been asleep at lest 3 hours ago. If you do end up quitting, which I hope you don't. The problem solving skills you picked up are very transferable. Best of luck, and if you have any questions feel free to reach out.

I really do love programming. I'm curious and love to learn new things...until I'm at work. Then I got overwhelmed with the amount of the informations, project logic etc. Maybe is because of the project (fintech), but Im the only one on the project who struggles, so its me not the project. Tbh I'm not the sharpest knife when it comes to math and logic. But after or year and a half of self learning and a year of work I just think I'm on a right level to be a good, even decent dev. And don't get me started talking about my coworkers lol. They are like light years in front of me. So I was thinking what to do next and your post gave me some answers. Thank you for that.

What cert?  
not the guy who replied to but I did a 16 week bootcamp that I didn't get a cert for and had 2 offers by week 15.  4 years into my career now. a bootcamp arms you with some of the knowledge, the rest is attitudinal

It tool me 4 years learning to code in my freetime while working help desk jobs. I ended up having to pay for a boot camp just to get recruiters to look at me (major corporations near me love to hire bootcampers). Finally got my 80k junior dev job, it will probably be a couple of years before I strike 6 figures. No regrets because there's no way I'd make this much on my previous job path, but there is no get rich quick schemes here.  
How did you stay consistent in your learning during for years ? I‚Äôm learning too but I can‚Äôt stay consistent as learning everyday

Being a dev this is 100% true. I graduated as a sys admin. But my entry level job was boring, low paying, and had a good amount of down time. I had taken 2 java courses in college so I had a little bit of programming knowledge. I didn't like Java probably mostly because the way I was taught it, so I decided to choose to learn something similar, C#.  During the downtime at my sys admin job I self taught myself C#. I got lucky because my company started wanting tiny automations like complex macros and windows forms apps. They had no idea the automation was possible and had order entry people doing the job. I volunteered to make the work automated and it grew into more complex work including an integration with an outside company. I strived to understand all the best practices and when I went to maintain my early code, I realized how important best practices were. I decided to try and land a software engineering job, I surprisingly got 2 job offers. I took one as a software engineer. After 6 years I've been promoted twice and am now a lead dev.  My advice, learn as much as you can. Learn best practices. Look back at early work and see either how much you have improved or where you can improve. Knowing how much you improved will motivate you, knowing where you can still improve will give you more goals for further improvement. Be confident in your answers and stick to your guns but never believe you know everything, always keep an open mind and know you can be wrong no matter how experienced you are. This all probably can apply to many careers. If a dev and looking back at old code, imagine yourself trying to change old code you may never had to in the past. If it horrifies you just thinking about changing the code, the code is likely poor, if your new code feels the same think of ways you can improve it's maintainability. If you feel only you could change the code and would be very difficult transition to someone else, it is also likely poor and overly complex code.

I recently got offered a remote job for 65k and I was ecstatic when they told me i made it. It took countless applications and a few interviews but it's so worth it. I'm not at 6 figures yet but I'm 22 so I'll take what i can get! I start next week :))

how can i show companies that i m a good dev?  
Do everything you can to show it.  Have a polished github page, with a couple pinned projects that have clean code and well manicured Readmes on them. Have a professional, well formatted, and tailored resume for the position you are applying to. (include links to github/linkedin/portfolio) Have a dope portfolio site with projects that help you stand out. Make sure projects are hosted. If they have any type of auth, make sure recruiters/hiring managers can bypass auth with guest login. Have an active Linkedin with a professional headshot, lots of connections, links to your github and resume, maybe even write articles on there and make (professional) posts Communicate openly, honestly, and professionally. Follow up on phone screenings, reach out to recruiters, attend meetups in person, try to network as much as possible.  Many decisions in hiring are made in literal seconds. Make sure you look serious and well put together right out of the gate. Give as much evidence as you possibly can that you're a serious candidate.

Positive story in response: It took me 6 months through a self study bootcamp. I worked HARD. I got a job offer in just under 30 days after graduation, getting paid 75k annually. 6 months later I got a raise to 83.5k, and I‚Äôm up for another raise in 5 months when I hit my one year at the company. I work 100% remotely, and work for a great company with a good company culture. 30 days, about 50 applications sent, 3 screening interviews, one coding challenge, one time being pushed forward in my interview process. I got the job networking with strangers on LinkedIn. Cold outreach until someone agreed to have a phone conversation with me.

 ignore anyone who says the job market is saturated... ... it's all about relentless pursuit   These statements contradict each other. In a saturated market, a small number of people (only) can get a job if they pursue, relentlessly. That doesn't mean it's not a saturated market, it means it is one. If there's 10 people for each vacancy, nobody's denying that any one of them might get the job,  but there will always be 9 that don't.

If there's 10 people for each vacancy, nobody's denying that any one of them might get the job,  but there will always be 9 that don't.

I have a strategy. I've done a bootcamp and that school is looking for teacher assistants. They hire illumni for that position. So, I'm going to apply, get them to pay for my bachelor than set out to the job market.  
This is a common path ive seen people take

congratulations on everything, and this is definitely a motivating post for anyone starting out  ‚Äã  It's all about relentless pursuit. People say the entry market is saturated, but it's saturated with shitty devs  but if that wasn't true why would those 8 companies reject you? don't mean to be rude just curious what you think the reason was.

How long, roughly, did it take for each of the four people you mentioned to work through this?  
Two were going at it full time and completed it in a little over three months. The other two have college classes and didn't quite finish (so I guess my title is a lie).  
How many months?  
lol my bad. 3 months. I edited the comment to fix it.

What framework/libraries are you working with? I set the localStorage debug mode true and it is really cool how the UI is clickable and explorable from a debugging standpoint.  
Do you mean on the pages I linked? That's Notion. I didn't make it.  
Oh I've never heard of Notion, I assumed you invented it and that it was the framework you build for the syllabus you provided, but now I understand that you just used Notion to build the syllabus. Still neat!

What background knowledge/prerequisites does one need for this? I'm absolutely new to programming. I have done a tiny bit of Matlab and C. I have done a lot of math if that matters.

Saved. Thanks for the syllabus, and the work you obviously put into this. I was laid off due to covid and want to learn more about coding without shelling out a bunch of cash. If I may ask: What kind of work have the people who have used your program found, and how did they demonstrate their knowledge and ability sufficiently to get a job? One more question: What hardware and/or software do you recommend for someone wanting to learn on a budget? Sorry for the noob questions, gotta start somewhere

oooohhh ill check this out... for the code book by petzold a quick google search led me to a free pdf of the book...not sure about posting links like that herer (so i wont)but wanted to give you a heads up... as your link just points to amazon.com to buy it. ‚Äã thank you for this.

Libgen has the pdf, if you can't afford the pdf rn. You can always buy the book later, like OP said, to support the authors.

Nice, i cant get past telling ppl how if works, "well if only executes 'if' the condition is true". And then i get a blank stare. At that point I smack the keyboard on the ground and hand them an english dictionary  
I'm assuming this exact story is hyperbole, but I hope you don't actually get frustrated with people for not understanding that definition of an if statement. It's not really accurate. The if statement executes either way. It's the code block that might not. And if someone doesn't know what an "if" statement is, they probably don't know what a "condition" means in this case. Explaining stuff is just like coding. You have to define your variables before you use them. That blank stare is an undefined variable exception. Explain truthiness ("In English, a lot of words mean 'no'. Like 'nope' and 'nu-uh'. Well in Python lots of things mean False, like 0 and None."). Then explain the parts of an if statement (if, condition, code block). Then how it works, then a few examples. It'll take longer, but they'll actually learn it and you'll both be a lot happier.  
For sure, i wrote it for jokes, never happened lol. The inaccurate description of an if statement was intentional though. It is what id usually use until a better understanding of code blocks is achieved, an attempt to somewhat simplify it.  
Well then my whole comment was a bit much.

This is probably the wrong question to ask, but I‚Äôm relatively new to python and I know there‚Äôs many different ways to apply the language (robotics, machine learning, data science, etc).  Does this syllabus point people in a certain direction while learning?

Heya , thanks for posting this, it may help me before I apply for Fresher job in October  I am half way done with my python udemy course and currently I have developed my first project using selenium web driver , I want to start with django from next month , where should I begin using your syllabus.  
You could skip How To Think Like A Computer Scientist if you want.  
Wait does it have maths. ? , If yes I won't skip that , I need to get better at maths and my logic at same time so I am currently studying discrete maths and will start data structure soon.

u/TravisJungroth - Sorry if this is a dumb question, but what does "HackerRank: 30 Easy" mean? I clicked the link and I've solved dozens of Python problems, but my rank is like 200,000. I signed up for their 30 days of code, but I can't advance that. I don't know when to stop. Did they change their website?  
Solve 30 hackerrank easy Python problems. Then, a total of 60 and 90. There's some screen in the Python path that show how many you solved. Or, just filter to Python and count them by hand.  
Ah gotcha, that makes sense, thanks for the clarification. I'm enjoying the syllabus so far!

This is great, but I have a question:  I'm going through 'How to Think Like a Computer Scientist' and I think its a great resource, but the exercises take a long time.  They're not necessarily difficult, but time consuming.      I'm trying to Learn Python / Django for a project, and between work, the books, and cspy I haven't been able to work on it at all. Are the exercises necessary? I'm not new to programming per se but I've only taken 1 year of CS classes so I have some gaps.  
None of this is necessary. If you want to put together a Django project, you can do that in a weekend or two. If you want to be good at coding, that‚Äôs going to take a long time.

I highly recommend Harvard's free, online 2016 CS50 "Intro to CS" course for anyone new to programming
I cannot recommend CS50 enough. It's a fantastic course. It's tough, but it's probably the best intro course I have ever taken. Plus, DJ Malan is in da house.  
would you say the estimate of 10-20 hours a week of homework is accurate?  
It really depends. For me, it was a total of about 5 hours(edit: a week*), but I'd already been programming for a while (something like seven years) before I took it. I've helped a few people through it, and for for most of them it was under ten hours a week. One student I tutored took something like 18 hours on average, but I don't know how reliable that is, since it was his parents keeping track. (As in, he might have been "working" on it while simultaneously playing League, so, yeah.) All in all, I think most people who are eager to learn this kind of thing will probably average closer to 10.

Something I don't understand - do you have to do it at a certain time? Or can you do it all any time? Do we have to 'attend' lectures as they are given? Is it all within a given timeframe?  
I'm enrolled in it right now, they give you all the materials you just have to finish it before a certain date. I think it was December for this one? Or September? I don't remember. You can watch the lectures at any time and submit the homework whenever you want to, you can even submit them all at once on a given day. The only requirement is that you finish before the deadline.  
Are the lectures all available as of now? Or are we in the middle of the course with more yet to be released?

How would one put this on a resume?  "Sat in on CS50?"  
This is what I don't get either. I'm currently enrolled through EDX as well. Why would this be put on a resume since it's an intro course? It's not like you mastered Java or anything. Sure it's from Harvard but they do these certificate things for like every course I've seen on EDX. I might as well just list every college course I've taken.

This is the point I tried to make. Why would putting an intro class on your resume show you have what it takes for a job? I imagine you'd want your resume to be one page long. Putting this is a waste of space.  The class is great to take for the knowledge alone. One of the best, if not the best, intro course to CS on the web for free.

The core of programming logic, how binary works, loops, format logic, API usage, simple graphics logic, etc... a lot of things. It's good to do if you are wondering if programming is something you should study. I did it a couple years ago and now I'm on my second year of CS, I certainly recommend it!  
I've been considering checking out a lot of these online classes I see from top uni's, but they always sound like they're going to be a fairly rigid time commitment and my schedule is too chaotic for that. Is this something you can actually do a bit of here and there, or is it more of a do everything on time or gtfo kind of thing?

Do you know if there is any other resource for these types of things? I was looking for a book (or something similar)  but I couldn't find anything fitting what I was looking for.  
Tbh I've looked at some resources online but nothing I've found comes close to taking classes in real life.  However, if that is not an option, I think Harvard and MIT have their intro to CS classes free online. They will be more boring than taking the random Coursera or Code Academy course but, in the long term, they will be better. For some fun starts and what not you can look for edx/Coursera/code Academy courses and then find games that relate to the lesson you just took. This is incredibly more helpful than simply taking the course and moving to the next lesson!  As for where to start exactly, I can't help. Just look around for anything that says intro to programming or so in those educational websites mentioned above. Some good languages to start would be Java/C/C++ with some people recommending Python but I haven't personally looked into it. Good Luck!

It's an intro course. No knowledge required. The course is great. c is a lot older than java and there's a lot more bookkeeping in it; but if you don't mind that go for it.

My goal is to be an entrepreneur, but I am more UI/UX design oriented than pure engineering (I still learn programming to produce MVPs for proof of concept) Would that course be good for what I want? I aim for an all round understanding in software engineering to properly communicate with my future team, but focusing on deep subjects in engineering is not my core competency.  
Yes I think CS50 would be! It's a great introduction to computer science in general, and then ends with some work in PHP and JS. That would put you in a good place to pick up material that's more what you're interested in, which will likely include some JS.  Plus, if you need skills in doing UX/UI for other platforms like iOS or Android, the other parts of the program that you will need to write will have a good foundation from CS50. Also remember that UX/UI isn't just about programming how things look, but the importance of getting good user input (say when you ask the user for a value or text) is part of the UX, and it's easy to make mistakes that make your code vulnerable to hacks/attacks if you don't know what you're doing. I think CS50 covers the basics of computer security well enough for you to be aware of what you need to look up later in your career.  Let me know if you have other questions!  
Thanks for replying! I always wonder how much one must learn to "Get" software. In HBO's Silicon Valley for example, even though everyone has a different expertise, they each somewhat get what everyone in the team does and it seems like every startup could use any one of Pied Pipers engineers as a CTO (maybe not an effective one - but still). What it takes to get to the level where you "get" what the people in a team are each doing? I would like to effectively communicate with every person in a company or a startup (not to the extent of doing his work - its impossible). Is this what CS101, CS50 and other intro classes help you with?

I was just about to start prepping for a bootcamp by learning the basics of JavaScript and Ruby (the bootcamp focuses on Ruby on Rails, JS, React, Flux, SQL, etc) and I was wondering if it might be a bad idea to try and take CS50 while learning JS and Ruby for the first time? Would it be confusing to try and do it all right now? I have a little programming experience from a few years back taking a C++ class at UCLA but really haven't touched it since the class.

I think it depends on what you want to get out of your CS education. JavaScript and Ruby will be very useful to you if you want to go on to do web development, and give you a lot of practical knowledge to work with. CS50, at least when I took it, will be entirely in C++ and will focus on very basic CS concepts like search and sort and algorithmic run-time; stuff that is foundational if you want to do real developer work in the long-run, but isn't very practical to know right off the bat. It will teach you how to think like a programmer but won't teach you anything about how to actually write code to make an app or website work. In fact, I don't think they even touch on HTML or javascript until the last two psets.

 real developer work  what do you mean by this? Of course knowing about different search algorithms and their runtimes is important but 99% of the time when you need something sorted or searched, the built in sorting and search functions on most high level languages already implement the most efficient algorithm.  
sure, you could just use the built-in packages, but if you want a job as a software engineer beyond simple web development work, you are going to have to know why those sorts and searches behave the way they do and why some are preferable to others so that you can choose the one you want as well as customizing/expanding upon it. Using a 'black box' approach won't cut it.

There are definitely other courses/starter programs that can help you get going in a specific direction (such as codecademy or courses), but I found CS50 to be so incredibly helpful building up my programming knowledge from basically nothing. It's definitely a great place to start!

The best thing about this course, to me, is the breadth and the depth of material it covers. I am someone who has taken multiple CS courses in college, done a codecademy sequence here and there, and read the first two chapters of numerous programming books. There were always holes in my knowledge. So I always felt like I needed to start from the ground up. So I would start some new book, or online resource, and then realize I was just learning things I already knew (for loops, variables, etc.), so I would skip ahead because I was impatient, then get frustrated because I was missing things. CS50 is perfect because it starts at ground zero, but doesn't waste your time.

I am about to be a senior in high school next school year, I have taken very basic programming classes in school already (HTML, CSS, Java) and will be taking AP comp sci next year. Should I take the class suggested in the OP or should I just come in with a relatively fresh mind in my AP class next year?

This is kind of a stupid question, bare with me please. Is this course worldwide or just restricted to specific countries? I'm from Egypt and I would very much like to learn programming from a great university like Harvard. I read half of a programming book on C++ and I am familiar with some stuff like loops, if statements, variables, pointers, etc. What are the requirements of attending this course? I'm going to a CS uni in a few months, but until then, I'd like to learn more before I do, lots of free time and I'm very eager to learn!

I have been on this sub long enough to know that people don‚Äôt come here to help other people, people come here to make themselves feel superior.  
It's that way in a lot of subs where people who are specialised in that topic will enjoy shitting on people for asking stupid questions, it's really sad and it discourages people from engaging with those communities. Laughing at/berating stupid questions is biig small pp energy, it doesn't make you smarter, I think it's just a big red flag for insecurity, like people who aren't so smart eager for any opportunity to be the intelligent one. Maybe it comes from those who suffer bullying themselves when they were learning? Sounds like exactly the kind of toxic abuse cycle humans are so great at.  
The most difficult thing for me right now as a beginner (and I‚Äôm truly starting from zero) is how many people ‚Äúexplain‚Äù something in JavaScript without actually explaining it. For example, the videos I‚Äôve seen about recursion that just say it‚Äôs a function that calls itself. Like I‚Äôm glad that makes sense to you dude, but help some of us out who don‚Äôt have a good visual idea as to what‚Äôs happening. It took me asking a lot of questions to figure it out, and when I did I realized it wasn‚Äôt me it was the terrible explanations.

I agree There is a lot of snobbery in anything that takes a lot of time and effort to achieve skill at, but along my way I've also found a lot of helpful and supportive individuals So it's best to keep the best in mind or you'll associate your passions with negativity

Yea, I gotta keep that in mind since I'm starting to notice the negativity in the things I'm passionate about. Best self advice for me is to not give up and be stubborn about my passions.

I had a fight on this very Reddit with a few people who disagree with this point.  I can't remember exactly the topic but it was something about "make sure you google before asking blah blah blah bullshit". I basically argued that newbies don't know "what" to Google and used the example of my 11 year old student who often writes weird rubbish into Google and clearly hasn't developed his knowledge to the point where he even knows what he should be Googling.  I got downvoted to hell!

It wasn't ignored...it was removed as a rule violation.  
;-; what ? why?  
Since it's been removed, I can't see the original post.  Based on the title, my guess is it was an ad of some kind, so fell under rule 2.

If you ask something that can be answered simply by pasting your question into Google (Or the Reddit search bar), you're showing a lack of respect for everyone here who takes time out of their day to answer genuine questions. Same goes for "asking for help to fix a code". I'm not saying your intent is wrong in any way, but you need to realize the difference between asking people to "Fix my code" and asking "Could someone explain what this-and-that means in this piece of code?". A third reason why I'd downvote a post like that is if the code isn't formatted in a code block but simply pasted as plain text.

Some people learn better by asking questions and having discussion. I'm here because I like helping those people too. Throwing the book at them doesn't help a lot of the time. They want a person to talk to, not a machine.  
There's a specific section in the FAQ about that

dude, like Halfspacer said, many of these questions are answered by googling. We're in 2020, one question will give you 100 different blog articles and 100 more youtube videos answering the question very well. ‚Äã Another thing is people asking for resources ... That's what reviews on udemy and comments on youtube are for. Also googling ...

I want to help people, unlike some other commenter assumed. But yeah, if the answer is in the FAQ or literally a Google search away, it means that the people who help you put more effort into it than you yourself have done.  
But sometimes in the beginning, even knowing what to Google puts your brain into a blender. Now googling answers is fairly straightforward for me, but when I took up coding, I used to constantly get frustrated at the fact that I neither knew what I was doing wrong, or even the name of the action I was taking so I could find out how to fix my problem.  I'd say rather than assume so ego-driven dribble about the levels of implied respect or effort expended, just don't answer the question if you feel it's beneath the threshold of what you consider worth addressing.  
Then show it in 'your'  post. Oftentimes there are posts that say "compiler gives me NullReference exception" with just some pasted code. That looks lazy, and it is likely to be downvoted and ignored. The same issue with "hey, it keeps giving me NullReference exception on line x. I tried to do x and y, but I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong since it keeps popping up. I thought that exception means yaddayadda, do I understand that correctly?" will most like get an answer. Its not so much the actual problem, but the communication surrounding it that makes the difference. People who address others as human beings instead of addressing others like a fuzzy-Google-bot are way more likely to get an answer.

They should have at least helped you with what was wrong with your code while also giving friendly advice about the coding format/style. I didn't know there are lots of people who are nitpicky about the coding format or style.  
To paraphrase the comment section, it was basically like ‚Äòre-format and then we will Help ‚Äò

Welcome to the internet.  
Yeah, fuck fostering a helpful atmosphere in a programming help forum  
More like fuck trying to control what you can't control and focus on what you can. You cannot control the actions of another. You can control your own actions. If I see a question I can answer, I answer it. I'm not going to feel some kind of way because someone else does not answer it.  
Except we can have an effect on the civility of the community.  If someone's being a condescending dickhead to someone asking newbie questions then they should be downvoted and called out on their bullshit.  If we don't, this place becomes a shit hole like StackOverflow.

Maybe stop looking at downvotes as some kind of measure of worthiness.  The majority of posts in this sub get only a handful of votes anyway.  Did you get the help you needed in the comments? If so, what do you care how many votes the post got? Edit: There's no shortage of irony that in a thread asking people not to downvote, my comment is downvoted.  Never change, Reddit.  
Not op but if posts have 0 or minus votes they are less likely to been seen. Which obviously means less chance of being answered.

More down votes makes it harder to see, which in turn makes it harder to get help. So caring about down votes here is perfectly understandable.

I don't care about reddit points. Problem is that Reddit's voting system will make downvoted posts just die and get little to no exposure, which doesn't help those who ask for help.

Boy, as someone studying to be a software developer, I've noticed there is a massive lack of visuals for some of the core concepts. This is really annoying if you're someone who learns by seeing. Plus, why not add some humor to learning? For me, when it's funny it sticks more quickly in my brain.  Also, younger students are getting into programming (think elementary school) , and you could reach a large demographic by creating a series that's fun and informative.

Can you give some detail as to what this is? The site doesn't give any real information.  
Hi! Yea the sign up page is pretty bare. I basically threw it together because people were asking for a way to get notified. The basic idea is a coloring book full of data structures and algorithms examples where you color in nodes/objects/indices and pointers/edges/arrows step by step.  This helped me a ton when interviewing because of the visual reinforcement, and I wanted to share the study technique.  Right now I'm working on sample coloring pages to send out to the mailing list to get some early feedback. Once I have a better idea of what people  really want, I'll put up a better landing page. Let me know what you think.  Cheers!

Agreed.  I'm intimidated by huge blocks of texts.  I like pictures.  And crayons. But seriously though, as I am also a visual learner, I prefer video tutorials and interactive things.  And pictures.  I get lost in the abstractions.  I get lost in the details.  Like binary trees for example, talk about them in text, and I get lost.  But I just watched Week 5 in Harvard's CS50, and saw them visually and they made perfect sense.  Actually, that same course also helped me resolve a few of my insecurities about pointers because the lecturer actually drew out how pointers and memory work, which helped the idea click. Pointers are such an arcane concept to a new programmer, but for visual learners like myself, actually seeing them in action, actually having a diagram for the stack and the heap really helps. This is true for many programming concepts, where I'd love to have some pictures rather than just some text.  
I'm exactly the same way - a long paragraph may as well be Egyptian hieroglyphics. After a few sentences of jargon, my brain simply refuses to latch on to the concepts.  When I study, I read a LOT of other people's code. Just seeing it implemented in one way helps me understand what's going on, but I can't help feel that a comic or an infographic would be more useful in the long run.  Btw, I'll have to check out the Harvard course, it sounds extremely helpful, thank you!   
CS50 is available on iTunes University or at edX for free.  They are long, about 90 minutes each, as they are actual Harvard lectures.  But they are highly informative. If you want to get a certificate out of it, you can actually do the course for $90, but I'm just watching the lectures right now.

Sounds like a cool idea! It will take some work to get the cartoon to both look good and express the ideas clearly and correctly. I designed/commissioned some cartoons and animations to teach Ruby on Rails concepts. You can check out the cartoons on my site Learneroo or see the animation on YouTube:  Rails MVC in 30 seconds,  Rails Forms videos. I'd still be interested in creating more content for my site but I haven't that much time to do that since I started a full time job (software engineer at Google). Still want to find some time one day, or maybe find people who'd like to contribute...  
Oh yeah for sure, that's one of my main concerns. I'm trying to abstract away a lot of the concepts and use real life scenarios as much as possible. I'm also still a student so while I think I have a pretty good grasp of the material, I'm going to have to do some digging/reading into making sure I don't fuck up people lol. Your site looks pretty cool‚Äì‚Äì perhaps we can collaborate on this to some degree. I'm working fulltime right now for IBM so this project will clearly have to be on the side, but I'm not planning for the illustrations to be terribly complex.

Chiming in to chime in. Newer to the dev world as in the last 2.5 years or so. Started as a web designer, then I wanted to make the dev side exactly how I pictured it. Don't know if I can be of help, and I have some other big projects I'm working on, but I'd be happy to provide some design work or contribute as I can/if you need. Being a visual person/learner that lack of visual was one of the most frustrating parts of getting started in the dev world. I couldn't even find a damn flowchart!  
Would love some help or guidance, I'll contact you soon.

If it's really ELI5 and not over-complicated I'd def subscribe and follow a channel like that. Yesterday I typed into YouTube "what is jquery" and instead of getting a simple, 1-2 minute video explaining what it is all I got was tutorials on how to use jquery when all I wanted was a simple answer to what exactly it is.

I'd love a series on various design patterns and their benefits and short comings explained.   
Could you give a list of things in particular you want explained, or make a pull request to the list on GitHub?  
A good visual run down of Singleton, Factory, Abstract and so forth.  Basically OOP overall would be good.

You guys get 3%?! I would kill for 3%! I'm a retail worker though lol. Last raise was 1.2% :-(  
Good news! You didn't get a raise. 1.2% is less than the increase in cost of living/inflation. Which is usually around 2%-3%.

what about something similar to this but for people who don't have academic education about computer science? something to bridge the gap for a self-taught programmer?  
If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything  
which one do you recommend ?  
Not u/hadbleak, but TYCS is a more focused approach, instead of having hundreds of different sources like OSSU. IMHO TYCS is the best choice.

After looking at that list on the site it doesn't look like you need a CS background from a university. That's all just a bunch of tools people who use Linux use alot. For one the terminal is just an alternate way to navigate a operating system. VIM is just a text editor and tbh Visual Studio code blows almost every text editor out of the water.

After graduating I have washed out of two software engineering jobs so far due to not having this knowledge and the impostor syndrome that lack of knowledge engendered.  This should be up there with data structures and algorithms in terms of pedagogical priority in my opinion.  
All your school should really have to do is post this syllabus where the sophomores are likely to find it. By senior year they will have googled the things on the list and added them to their skillsets, or realized they aren't that curious about the craft.  
Oh wow, you're so right, this field and degree aren't like other fields, it's a true calling, you either have, or you don't, all you need is to have the words mentioned to you and you should be kept awake nights in a fevered dream about you you must learn the newest framework, you need to know about all the different command line utilities, it's an absolute necessity for you to self actualize by satisfying your burning curiosity about everything CS, or else you simply don't have what it takes to make it in this elite field.   Get fucked. My university was very free and open in treating me like a customer when it came to paying the tuition, yet when I want something for my money it's a big fuck you, it's all on you, we're not here to hold your hand or do anything for you.  No, you bastards, I'm paying for this, tens of thousands of dollars for half-assed Power Point presentations, you get to treat me like a customer, then I get to treat you like a business and I expect something for my money.  What I got was substandard, I shouldn't have to be three or more standard deviations above the mean to make it, especially when these tools could be at least mentioned, pointed to, once, or hey, explained in terms of their relevance, or even a class on, at least a work shop, walked through a bit, something.  Nope.   If you think this stuff is obvious, then you probably don't realize to what extent your context and particular circumstance have front loaded a lot of concepts and ideas you happily take for granted.  Are you familiar with the term "curse of knowledge"?  
You'd last a month then I'd palm you of to IT. If you aren't curious about how to do things that sound interesting and improve your productivity, in a field where the entire process is using a thousand tools to turn your meat into a machine generator, then you should probably go into grocery restocking. And I get fucked just fine without the encouragement, thank you.

 1/15: Editors (Vim)  NOT. BIASED. AT. ALL. Please note that I am a vim die-hard but this is kind of crazy. I'm one of the very few developers that knows Vim. Most developers don't use vim (crazy, I know right!)  
Counter argument: as a security professional that spends lots of time on remote machines via ssh, vim is my best friend and knowing how to use it is actually a very powerful tool. When I was a developer it would have never been my choice, but I guess it's a case of "a tool for every trade, a trade for every tool".

Don't worry about it! Vim is quite cool once you get the hang of it  
I've got bad habits of hitting ctrl-z or backspace or using the numpad which messed me up pretty good while trying to use vim.

How do they edit files when sshing into a server. Had to learn vim specifically for that  
As a dev I hope you aren't  regularly in the situation where you have to ssh into servers to hotfix things...  
At a university you normally ssh into a server so you can build things on that system, since it is more powerful. Also if something is processing you can turn your laptop off or put it to sleep and the server keeps on going. At least that's how I think most people use this. It is not used so you can "hotfix something in production." Having a GUI that you do everything from is a bit overrated, and a lot of them are poorly designed anyway. Text interfaces are more limited but more reliable as well.

The site mentions machine learning as something people probably learned about, I‚Äôm about to finish my degree in CS and I never had a course in my program specifically about machine learning, should I be concerned? Any suggestions for online resources to educate myself more about it?  
No, machine learning is still a young field. I've never taken a class on it however my senior project this semester will have a machine learning component.  
Machine learning isn‚Äôt a young field, but it is a very specialized one. Most software engineers will probably never need to know anything about it

It's a bunch of shit you should have learned if you worked at all in your field during college.  I went to Podunk university with a pretty crappy CS program and my friend group knew all this stuff because we all worked in IT and did internships.

Good Guy Al: Writes an awesome introductory book on applied programming / python. Gives it away and even spoon feeds it to you for free.  
Some Beggars: "it's not enough, give me more" probably  
Really the only way for me to learn is for someone to stand behind me and say do this do that and explains 'this is why'  
And hits you when you do something wrong, amirite?

May I just be off topic one moment?   Thank you SO much for what you've done for this community!  Your book, and your dedication to Python and teaching Python are so inspirational.  I really appreciate you! ‚Äã Get this guys book!  Learn Python!  It will save you so much time!

Haha, thanks! I'm really grateful to all the people who work on Python, and the folks behind the Creative Commons license which makes it easy to create share-friendly content. And also my editors, because I can't word good and want help me do other stuff good too.  
General question for you - I‚Äôm a big Python guy myself, but it isn‚Äôt without its issues & criticisms. What do you think the biggest issue for Python is in the foreseeable future? And further, what do you think reserves Python a spot at the ‚Äúbig kids‚Äù table?  
I mean, aside form Java and C/C++, Python is the most popular programming language. (Even bigger than JavaScript according to most charts, which suprised me.) Python is the top language in so many different fields (data science, web app backends, sys admin scripting, devops, etc.) The main places where Python hasn't broken into is gaming, embedded (though MicroPython is coming along nicely), mobile (though Kivy and Beeware are working on this) and the holy grail, web frontend (it'd be amazing to have Python in mainstream browsers). I don't see a lot of existential threats for Python right now. Like, I'd put money on C/C++ being replaced by Rust/Go and Java replaced by Kotlin eventually. But nothing's on the horizon that could compete with Python. Like, the biggest threat to Python 2 and Python 3 are, well, Python 3 and Python 2. That migration was really tough, but Python 3 has been rolled out in more places than people realize.

Al I'm a big fan. About halfway through the course currently.  Quick question: What resources would you use after the course is completed to take my python knowledge further? Any certain types of OOP projects you would recommend or courses? My main goal is to use python for technical interviews, so any input to further my knowledge to get there is really appreciated!

I've been looking into web scraping and haven't found a tutorial I like yet. So this will help a lot thank you do much! You literally inspire me, I want to be able to do something like this. Write something like this for programming or circuits, and share it for free and not worry about making money. Just honestly trying to help people learn something new and better themselves.

A lot of their Python courses are 95% off for the next few days. I'm not too familiar with Udemy. Are sales like this common? I'm interested in learning more Python, but I don't want to go spending $50 on like 5 courses just to take advantage of these deals, and then end up not finishing them and finding the same sale 3 months from now.

TIL that a software engineer filed a Freedom of Information Act request to get access to NSA's training material for teaching Python, the popular programming language. The material is now available for free online for anyone who wants to learn Python using it.
As someone who has sat through countless government trainings, I‚Äôm gonna pass on this one.  
I dunno, some military training programs, maybe I'm thinking of A-School materials, that are ridiculously good.  I had a Navy vet as a physics professor and the textbook was his own, which was based off how he was taught math, calc and trig, in the Navy and it was amazing.  
He probably went to the Naval Academt which is a great college and not a training course

Ah yes, government. It was probably created by the lowest bidder.  
You have a misunderstanding of the government procurement process. The cheapest bidder doesn't always win if they don't meet all the requirements. Let's say a project has 11 requirement and Company A places a bid for $100K but meet only 10.5 of the items. Company B is new in the space and meets all 11 and puts in a bid for $140K. Then we have Company C that's an industry expert with history in implementing all 11 items and has a bid for $150K. More often than not Company C will get the contract.  
This! Government procurement rarely leads to just "lowest bidder" winning. Bidding is highly bureaucratic with many requirements that are explicitly laid out in the bidding contracts. This is meant to bring up front accountability to the bidding process: lay out all requirements, find the best person for the job and then choose the lowest price, while being "fair". However, as any engineer knows, pre-determining the requirements for a project and team to implement that project is very difficult, which is why government project bids often pay too much or fail to accomplish their goals well.

You forgot company D with great lobbyists and political donations that puts in a bid for 500k-1 million

Also if the company has a good reputation it supports their chances. If their CORs say they are great to work with that is very desirable.  Often these contracts also have flexibility to add responsibilities and task orders. If a contractor working in the org can staff the project they may get the task without a new contract being written and bid. Even then, very often a contract will go to a lower bidder who claims they can handle the work but then completely cannot hire any SWEs or other technical people for the budget and they look like ass. I bet that's happening wayyyy more these days when they have to complete with people who can work from home elsewhere and value that more than a low salary from a contractor.

why wouldnt company b get it? they meet all the requirements and they are cheaper than company c. that sounds like company c will always get it kind of by default, that doesnt sound good in the long term. thats ignoring all the corruption, nepotism, etc thats common in goverment stuff too

When the opening line is: "So you're teaching the Python class. What have you gotten yourself into? You should probably take a few moments (or possibly a few days) to reconsider the life choices that have put you in this position", you're sweetly reminded that some people in the NSA still have a grasp of humanity.

I know you didn‚Äôt make this argument but I think it has to be said that ‚Äújust wanting to work on cool projects‚Äù doesn‚Äôt remove complicity when the projects hurt people. SWE‚Äôs who work at the NSA are enabling international privacy violations and using that data to hurt people in ways we don‚Äôt fully understand yet.  
You‚Äôre right but the issue is: when are you doing evil? And it‚Äôs often impossible to tell. If I work on a tool that gets used in a larger process and that process then gets used in an evil project, to what degree have I done evil? Like maybe I would‚Äôve said no to the evil project, but this tool can‚Äôt possibly cause harm as far as I can see, so I do the project because it‚Äôs my job and my kids need to eat.

I feel that at my current job. I thought that for the pay they were offering (60% more than my last role) I would be able to make peace with some personal objects I have about the industry I was joining, but no dice I still do.

Some of those ‚Äúcool projects‚Äù included spying on not only all Americans and many other foreign citizens, but spying on their exes like creeps

Engineers have an ethical responsibility and obligation to the public / humanity.   ‚Äú‚Ä¶I was just following orders‚Äù really doesn‚Äôt cut it  
Your boss tells you to spy on the suspected terrorist in the US. If you don't they might (or someone like them) bomb something. Refusing is allowing evil to happen but passively. Actively building a tool that allows the 3-letter agencies to track and spy might save lives (A good thing) but someone far up the chain of command might use that same tool, once developed to spy on an American citizen. If you pick up a garden shovel and beat your neighbor to death with it, that's that the fault of the guy who made the shovel. If you use my deer rifle to hunt homeless people instead of deer, that's not the fault of the rifle manufacturer. If you go to the library for a month to teach yourself how to make explosives and blow up a school, that's not a reason to close libraries down or burn books. All of those things are tools. They can be used to do good or evil.  And to be clear no one is "Building the whole spy network" themselves. Bob the engineer is being told "figure a way to break into this specific system" or whatever. He's not told why or how that tool will be used or IF it will be used. A tool chain of 100 software pieces is used to spy and build reports on people. And all of those tools were worked on by tens or hundreds of other people. To "avoid doing evil" in your viewpoint you have to allow a lot of evil to happen because you are doing nothing. The same tools that prevent evil from happening can be used to do evil. That's not on the engineer.

The choice to work on "cool" projects that are evil is an evil decision. Facilitating evil is evil.  
Knives can be used to cut meat or to kill people. It is not evil to cut meat. It is evil to kill people. Intent is important. Evil is a point of view.

 I think a lot of the ‚Äúevil‚Äù decisions are likely made by politically motivated bureaucrats at the top.  sort of. If you've been in the beltway (DC) you've heard that CIA stands for Christians in Arms. All the 3-letter agencies recruit heavily from fundamentalists religions (Oh trust me I know how the tinfoil hat vibe feels as you read that) Arguments are made for "low drug use" etc, but the reality is the statistics are way out of whack. Why might someone recruit a person who just accepts what they are told to do, even "evil" stuff if they believe they are doing "the greater good?" Well that's obvious. https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/why-mormons-make-great-fbi-recruits  After the creation of the CIA , Christian missionaries played a very important role in destabilizing various countries and in carrying out espionage activities on behalf of the CIA.   the NSA is a bit different. They recruit first on merit and second on "passing clearance checks" as many of the analysis etc don't need to really operate at all in any area they don't want to. So while someone who speaks 5 languages at some college might get tapped on the shoulder, for the NSA if you wrote your own compiler or found a much more efficient way to compile with gcc, etc it's likely you get tapped and at least offered, at bare minimum from someplace like IBM or Booze Allen that does the contract work.

This is the same argument my friends who work in the defence industry use. "I just want to work on cool projects! I want to solve interesting problems! I want to overcome unique challenges!" It doesn't wash. You can work on cool projects without killing people or violating their basic human rights.

Cowardly edit. It's safe to assume that most of the projects worked on by the NSA aren't evil

No, they aren't. They're simply evil people with evil intentions and know how to use certain tools, and wish to use it for evil. However, they want to do it legally (or at least, without facing punishment from the govenment). People who want to kill people join the military. Just watch the video that Assange leaked. They don't do it out of good will, because it's impossible for them to be this ignorant.  
When the opening line is: "So you're teaching the Python class. What have you gotten yourself into? You should probably take a few moments (or possibly a few days) to reconsider the life choices that have put you in this position", you're sweetly reminded that some people in the NSA still have a grasp of humanity.

More like most people are just incredibly ignorant of the NSA in general or any more secretive government agencies.   The NSA does a real substantial and necessary job for the United States.

TIL that a software engineer filed a Freedom of Information Act request to get access to NSA's training material for teaching Python, the popular programming language. The material is now available for free online for anyone who wants to learn Python using it.
I'm curious -- what made him think that the NSA had its own Python training material, and wasn't just utilizing any of the other Python courses and guides? Maybe he saw it referenced somewhere and wanted to see what was inside, and figured it probably wasn't highly classified so it might be available via FOIA.

It depends. These docs are not going to show you how to make anything, they just document how individual stuff works. If you don't look at these items and come up with ideasfor projects, you're probably better off with Automate the Boring Stuff w/Python.

Wonder how good it is tho  
Why wonder?  
Because there exists an assload of already good learning materials online, easily accessible and verified by users everywhere.  Aside from the novelty aspect of this, every student should ask themselves if it's worth sinking their precious time into this material EDIT: don't mean to sound snarky, since I also wonder... But don't see the point in investigating this learning source unless there's some awesome value add I can't get anywhere else

How to start learning to code when you don't know where to start
I started learning on codeacademy, went to freecodecamp and then am now doing edX's CS50 (which is free). I recommend that anyone starting to code start by watching the first lecture of CS50. I didn't do this, but watching the first lecture got me really excited about coding even though I'd been doing it daily for 6 months and it also lays out concepts in a very easy-to-grasp way. It also introduces you to a program called Scratch, which was designed for elementary school kids and does an amazing job at teaching someone the basic structure of code.

It also introduces you to a program called Scratch, which was designed for elementary school kids and does an amazing job at teaching someone the basic structure of code.   
Is code academy a good way to start, or do you recommend doing cs50 first?  
I liked codeacademy for the interface and the way their course is set up -- it makes you feel like you're learning a lot and that you're progressing quickly. In retrospect it certainly wasn't a bad way to start, but I didn't know as much as I thought I did at the end of the Javascript class because it wasn't that challenging. I learned a lot of syntax but I didn't understand why the syntax is the way it is. I like CS50 because it breaks coding concepts down in an engaging way and gives a much broader overview of basic coding structure. The problem sets are the right amount of challenging. I recommend it over codeacadmy because learning why something is the way it is makes for a greater understanding.  Out of the methods I did, I would rec starting with cs50. Second would be codeacademy and third would be freecodecamp (to its credit, the FCC projects are great).   
I feel the same way about codeacademy, and I don't recommend them to anyone. You just don't learn. I'm sorry but it's the hard truth, using one syntax one time isn't going to teach you why it exists, why it works the way it does, and what can you do with it. FreeCodeCamp is just a hundred times better because they teach you the syntax, they teach you HOW to solve problems (read-search-ask style, the community they build, the forum for help on gitter which is fucking amazing). Their lessons are actually better (to me) as well, and they actually set you on a path for learning (first front end and/OOP/algorithms, then data visualization and then back end, with a lot of information on other stuff such as chrome developer), and you have projects which you can use to fixate that knowledge you've just got (and depending on how hard you go on those projects, you learn much much more). Unless you're paying for additional content + projects, codeacademy it's just a waste of time, and I don't know why spend money when there's such a good alternative. THAT BEING SAID, codeacademy is fine if you're just looking into learning a syntax for a new language.  
How to start learning to code when you don't know where to start

Thanks, you're right that those are perfectly valid technologies for backend work.  However, my intention wasn't to be comprehensive in all possible languages for a given development field. Java, Scala, golang, Haskell, etc are all viable backend languages, but the greatest developer mindshare seems to be the ones I mentioned.  This is actually the problem with starting to learn coding that I was trying to address in the post.  Yes, these are my opinions and therefore they're not the only way to go forward. However, I wanted to cut through the clutter and suggest the 1-3 languages and resources to start with for a given field. These suggestions are based on what I see as the general consensus of what most people and companies are using for new projects.  Yep, I could be wrong (and probably am for some people), but I hope that for most people, the clarity I'm offering is more valuable.  
The general consensus varies from area to area. I'm on the east coast (North), and 90% of job listings are for C#/MVC I've literally never even seen a job posting (not that I've looked specifically) for Ruby/python web dev. I know one person working with JS on the back end, and everything else I see is PHP. Anyone starting with Python out here is going to be SOL for work You really should update the guide.  
Well shit, I just spent the last hour learning python.

How to start learning to code when you don't know where to start
Great post dudebro  
How to start learning to code when you don't know where to start
How can I tell if coding is not for me? I mean for web/software development, not only as hobby  
The simplest answer is if you don't like it. Why do something you dislike?   A more nuanced answer is that you may not like coding in a specific industry or type (mobile/front-end/back-end).   What I would suggest is to try it.  What makes you question whether it's for you?  
Well.. I'm not very good at maths. I had experience with C# and it was hard to learn for me. And yeah, sometimes it was tedious   
Don't get hung up on the math bit. Really. Most everyday development doesn't involve complex math.  What did you find difficult about C#?  
Well.. I'm not very good at maths. I had experience with C# and it was hard to learn for me. And yeah, sometimes it was tedious   
Most coding isn't math. I end up doing a lot of math in code but that it because of my domain. I actually think coding is more closely related to philosophy than anything else. It's more related to reasoning through logic flows.  I will also go as far to say the majority of the software written does simple things in simple manners. Granted it might be glued together in a crappy obscure way. Which goes gets more into software design.

Serious and a newbie question. Why php is hardly mentioned here? Isnt it good for a front and backend?

How to start learning to code when you don't know where to start
Step 1: Pick a language out of the following     a.  Java     b.  Javascript     c.  Python     d.  C++     e.  C#     f.   HTML5 Step 2: Follow a tutorial for one of those languages, if you need help on that there's a wiki in the sidebar.  Start building with what you know CODE EVERY DAY (this is the most important thing) Step 3:  Get an idea and start to build, when you get stuck, google, refer back to your tutorial, search on here, stackoverflow, and other code sites for your specific language.  Never take someone's entire solution without understanding what every part of it does.   Step 4:  repeat step 3 a couple dozen times. Step 5.  Go apply for a job.   Now in Java: ArrayList <String> languageList = new ArrayList(); languageList.add("java"); languageList.add("javascript")' languageList.add("Python"); languageList.add("C++"); languageList.add("C#"); languageList.add("html5");  Random RN = new Random(); int randomInt = RN.nextInt()%languageList.length(); String userLanguageChoice = languageList.get(randomInt);  int userLevel = 1;  String userStatus = "noob"; while (userStatus.equals("noob")) {     if(userLevel < 50){          System.out.println("Study more to level up");          userLevel++; // this should probably be in an if statement      }    else{        userStatus = "noLongerNoobly";    } }  int projectsCompleted = 0; while(projectsCompleted < 50){    codeEveryDay();    workHard();    learnHowToSearch();    writeYourOwnCode();    repeat();    projectsCompleted++; }  Edit:  please note that the above was done by sight and without use of an IDE -- that may or may not compile -- will definitely need some imports and a class.  
Which of these is not like the other? a. Java b. JavaScript  c. Python d. C++ e. C# f. HTML 5 HTML 5 is a markup language. It's not Turing complete. That means the vast majority of the problems dealt with in the world of software engineering can't be solved with HTML 5. I'm not saying HTML 5 isn't useful, but I would never suggest it as a starting point. You're going to reap a lot more benefits mastering a programming language.   
Also, as hard as this is going to sound, if you know you really want to build applications and not do backend development, you need to get your feet wet in design as well. Design is hard and often an entirely separate set of skills from what you face as a developer. Developers are often trying to find how to perform integrations or model data for problems that have already been solved on the design or business front, or that are behind-the-scenes sort of things that exist almost purely as technical problems. When you want to build something other humans will find useful or interesting... well, you really need to decide if you want to "double" in both design and development, or separate your time between either or. Don't think becoming an expert in algorithms and programming languages will make building stuff, especially from scratch, all that much easier. Other than "not knowing how to start", "not knowing how to actually build something" is the #1 complaint I hear from developers, often from people that are almost done with their university programs.  
Hmm, I'm mostly interested in designing the user interface and experience, is there a point to learning Ruby for me?  I started with Ruby, because the code academy I'm applying to teaches it, along with Javascript. Will it hurt me to do both?  Other than JavaScript do I need to learn ux ui tools? Tools to quickly and visually mock up a design before I try to code it with javascript?

On the line "int randomInt = RN.nextInt()%languageList.length();", why use modulo instead of just using .nextInt(languageList.length())? Is there any benefit to it?

I want to create something to make my work go much much faster. I have zero experience. I essentially have to cut and paste multiple short paragraphs and a photo into a new email.  I work at a talent agency and I pitch clients to casting directors. Each email is the same: GREETING ROLE 1 NAME ACTOR 1's PITCH ACTOR1's HEADSHOT ACTOR 2's PITCH ACTOR 2's HEADSHOT ROLE 2 NAME ETC ETC SIGN OFF I'm assuming I'd need something like Pythin could do this but I have no idea.  What I'd imagine making is basically a list of text inputs where I could type in the role name, then the actors names etc and it would compile all the information from some sort of database so I could just cut and past it into an email instead of doing each actor individually. Any help on where to start could be appreciated!

How to start learning to code when you don't know where to start
My biggest problem is that i don't know why i want to learn programming. I don't have an app idea or a game idea. I want to work as a programmer, but don't know in which area.   
Interesting! Not everyone has an idea already, so I wouldn't put too much weight on that. Personally, I didn't have a specific plan or area that I wanted to go into. We can work on specific areas little by little.    What makes you excited about programming? Why that instead of some other profession?     
Well, I want to learn programming, because I want to work as a freelancer in much warmer country than mine :) I mention this problem, because I tried to learn many times, but droped after a few weeks-months. I tried C++ when I was young. A few years ago I tried python and I really like it, but I didn't know how and where to use it and get tired of solving puzzles on check.io. My last attempt was html+css+javascript, I made a few sites(bad one), pass a coursera course, tried jquery, node.js and angular and tried get a job. No need to mention that I failed :) Now I want to start again, but you know that doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is insane.

Yeah, or that it's not that important which language you start with. If I had to start from scratch today, I'd probably recommend Javascript, as it's ubiquitous, doesn't need any software or compiler installing, and has all of the common programming structures that you need to learn.

Respectfully, I think you are so wrong it hurts. I started learning Java from a book in 2000. Lots of people are like me and did great. If you qualify your position then I might agree. I don't think learning search&sort is more important than learning how to create a cool demo for beginners.  Combinatorics isn't required to write code even though they have a lot in common.  
By concepts I meant oop vs functional, learn where, when, why and how to use if-then, loops, etc. I have seen too many peers who "know" a language, but can't solve a simple problem where, e.g. recursion could be used.

Bookmarked. Thank you! My dad is a programmer so I knew more than the average Joe but I don't have much experience at all. Recently I started going through all of the programming courses on Khan Academy. They seem informative to me but what is the general consensus on KA and how far should I expect it to get me? Edit: Right now I'm learning JavaScript and I'm interested in web and game development. The Khan Academy courses seem to cater those fields as they teach mainly JS with some HTML and CSS. Is there a downside to JS? What you said above makes it seem like that's the most applicable language to know therefore the best to start with.

I have a serious grudge against online courses for whatever language because they don't teach programming. They teach the syntax of a language. What I need is to learn how to think like a programmer. This comment  is a perfect example: a real world problem that must be solved. How to judge what language is the best for this case? How to translate my needs into code? How to build an efficient alghoritm for this? THIS is what I need, not another extended rendition of Hello World.

Cornell's entire Machine Learning class (CS 4780) is now entirely on You Tube. Taught by one of the funniest and best professors I have ever had.
that's fucking amazing. are the course materials and any sample code available?  
Second this. Any homeworks available too?  
lectures are interesting but most of the work occurs outside lecture so that's specifically why I was requesting those materials  
Coding assignments were done on vocareum, so I doubt many of the people in the course downloaded them. The written assignments are PDFs not publicly available though I did save them when I took the course last fall.

What kind of math do I need to know to keep up?  
Machine learning requires statistics, Lin alg, and multivariable calc. But you could probably just take the professors word on a lot of the differentiation.  
Haven't taken this course specifically, but at least for the deeplearning.ai course, having an understanding of single variable calculus and an understanding of matrices was good enough to understand the intuitions behind ML/NNs.  
Might anyone have resource recommendations for these two concepts? I'm super interested in this stuff, but concerned that my no-more-math-just-play-jazz-and-read-poetry approach to education after 11th grade pre-calc will prove to be a hindrance.

4780 ? So , this is a 4th year college level class ? Could a middle aged , educated person learn this ?  
if you have taken statistics, Lin alg, and multivariable calc, yes.  
Are the homework assignments for the class available online somewhere?

Is this something someone would pick up if they‚Äôve completed CS50?  
Machine Learning is really not something like a data structures course or a systems course. It is really just a mathematics course. So having classes in statistics, Lin alg, and multivariable calc is a better indicator  than any previous CS course.  
Stats, linear algebra, and Python libraries were my big takeaways from my ML class. Actually, mostly Python libraries and me saying "what on Earth is an eigenvector?" I haven't taken linear algebra, so it was a rough quarter.

True, but his course is around 5-10 years old. ML has come a long way since the stuff he covers (unless he has something newer that I'm not aware of... in which case please let me know because he's amazing). Edit: To be clear, I'm certainly not saying his course isn't good. I'm just saying there's a lot more to learn than what he covers.

Nice. Dude. If you ever find other resources like this one let me know. PM me  
As a general rule of thumb MIT's OpenCourseware (OCW) is full of this type of course, usually with full supplemental materials for psets, exams, recitations, etc. It's literally exactly the same course material and is pretty good as long as the professor isn't a terrible teacher.

Think of it as a marathon not a sprint. Can't stress this enough. cs50 is great but it can break you. Maybe do it alongside other things so you don't feel like garbage when you hit a wall. There are plenty of Harvard students (so very smart people) who have one on one time with mentors available on campus to help them with the course, and they swear that it's too difficult.

I clicked the link for cs50, is the program free or fee based? I think I've also seen this linked to the OSSU as well?

I‚Äôm currently looking for an entry level developer and couldn‚Äôt care less about a degree if the basic foundation and aptitude are there, but this person would have a lead dev to learn from. Look for opportunities with companies in trade industries where degrees aren‚Äôt as important in general.

Where to these companies exist? Because I'm in Oklahoma and have gone nowhere with this drive and passion. At least, with web dev and certain other dev.

StackOverflow is a great resource but it also has a very high bar for question quality, and it isn‚Äôt the place to "bounce ideas around". A question that is too vague, chatty, or unspecific will get downvoted and closed almost instantly. OP, I don‚Äôt mean to discourage you, only to warn you that asking questions on StackOverflow can be a slightly traumatizing experience for new programmers, unless your question is very well researched and presented.

I'm in a similar situation as the OP, and appreciate all the information! As a starting point, where would one start when it comes to math? After taking a look at the OSSU, what worries me is the math portion. It has been almost 20 years since I have touched any algebraic math, hence I have a feeling I will have to start from scratch. Can anyone shed some light on where I should start and how important these core math concepts will be as I progress through the course? I have attempted programming before and I am determined to succeed however I feel like i'm missing some baseline math skills that will be valuable to my success in any of these programs including CS50. Thanks!!

Roughly how much do you make? Just curious to get some ball park numbers  
I switched careers at 35 to development. Started at $75k but was at $180k within a year (switch jobs) working remote. After 5 years used the skills I learned to start my own online business and clear more than that now.  Marketing yourself properly is important.   
how did you get into software development? sounds like you were already working as a different role in an IT company if you started at 75k.

How long did switching tracks take till you got a paying job? My guess was always 1-3 years of working almost daily 4-6 hours. It all depends on persons aptitude, but that was the timeframe I would always guess.

I'm 40+ Did a bootcamp... now have job. My previous career was technical (networking) but had no programming involved in it.  
Did you go straight from bootcamp to job?  Or were there other steps in there, to refine you skills?  
Few months after bootcamp I got my job.  I spent a month brushing up my resume / studying after the bootcamp ended. I did put A LOT of time into the bootcamp.   If I was going to do it I was all in.   If it wasn't eat or sleep, or family, I was coding. IMO in order to learn / stand out if you're doing a bootcamp, you gotta put in A LOT of extra time.     
which bootcamp did you attend to???  
I'm 40+ Did a bootcamp... now have job. My previous career was technical (networking) but had no programming involved in it.  
Sorry for my ignorance but what is a boot camp , how long do they last, prereqs for joining? How does it help get a job? Cost?  
A technical school for programming. Usually 16hrs/day, lasting for 2-3 months. They cost generally in the $15k-$20k range. They help with getting a job, but they used to help much more. More recently, they're known for turning out mass numbers of somewhat-decent applicants who end up flooding the entry-level market. A computer science degree is more valuable than a bootcamp, but a bootcamp is faster. If you have connections a bootcamp is the way to go. If you don't a computer science degree is the way to go.  
I'm 40+ Did a bootcamp... now have job. My previous career was technical (networking) but had no programming involved in it.  
Can I ask what made you switch that way?  I'd heard some talk that server infrastructure and networking are more stable positions as they can't really be outsourced as easily? Also not sure if the salary is a lot better in programming or anything like that.  Admittedly the people making the server and networking jobs sound good to me have an interest in doing so, so I'm unsure if that part was accurate.

 Is it unrealistic of me to think I can become a programmer at 34 with no real background in programming?  No. Don't ever think in those terms, met devs online who got into the fields at their 40. 2 years later, lead of android development team in the place he is working at.  ‚Äã

You can definitely do it! I started taking a few community college progrmaming classes at 31 with a previous degree in French and a shitty data entry job.  Fast forward to age 34 I have a job as a software dev. I'm still going to school at night and probably won't have my degree before I'm 38, but hey.. I was going to be 38 anyway so I might as well have the degree.

I got my CS degree when I was 39, and there were others that were older so age isn't an issue.  There's people on here that say they didn't have to go to school and they got jobs as front end developers.  I'm assuming you'd work and go to school?  That's fine, don't quit your job if you don't absolutely have to.  My advice, go through Khan, find what you like, java, backend, front end, etc and see what options are out there in your area and what they require.  If you have to go back to school, you'll have to do some high end math, but once you get into the job, you probably won't need it.  I originally went for a two year at a community college, but the town I was in had almost no IT jobs, so I had to look elsewhere.  All the big cities though had four year schools that were putting out people with bachelors so I couldn't compete.  So went back for a four year degree and got a job about eight hours away.  
Dang how was night school? Were you actually able to get the bachelors in 4 years?  
You should look into WGU not a shill lmao  
Do you definitely recommend WGU? Totally serious question. I'm really considering it. Thanks in advanced.

I think it has to do with lifestyle more so than background. Are you married with kids? Have an active social life? Do you have hours to spare every day? Are you able to resist the temptation to consume media like movies, TV shows and games in lieu of much less immediately (but ultimately far more) gratifying things? Anything can work if you're willing to treat it like work, but most people this age are properly chained into position and have very little free time or leeway.

True! I meant in terms of free time alone, definitely no shade on spousal support or those who can juggle that much, I'd think you're the exception to this though. Good work and good luck regardless!

Age doesn‚Äôt matter. You face the same battle as everyone else, it‚Äôs not any more uphill. You need to learn the skills and then demonstrate you know them in order to get a job. Same as everyone else. If it‚Äôs what you want then just go for it.   
Hell, at 34, I've found learning to actually be much easier than when I was younger and dumber.  Having a mature brain is not a setback, as long as you aren't battling with some kind of pride issue.  
Same here. I was a terrible high-school student, I was interested but couldn't conform and teachers hated me for the most part. Spent too long in service industry type jobs and although I don't entirely agree with other posters here that age is not an issue in tech, I am employed. I have to keep learning (as in literally doing online courses) to keep up and to stay relevant. But it is much easier now than it was when I was young.

Skip formal institutions.   Start with online tutorials khan Academy/Udemy etc. Practice on your own (this will help you understand your gaps) Join a boot camp (cement what you learnt in step 1, fix what's lacking from step 2) Build some cool shit, practice- practice- practice.  (Collaborate with other people to build a small portfolio) Network, and think about the business/customer problem you want to solve.  This is a good way to land your first Gig. Most importantly, have fun. Programming is a skill that anyone can learn. Its also an art and your creativity and your unique perspective would help you differentiate yourself.

Could you share how it's going for you? I'm very interested because I'm 41 and just enrolled in a CS program at a university in Germany.

I‚Äôm 33, I quit my job and went to boot camp in January and accepted a devops offer today

I did this. You can too. I went Stanford cs101 => freecodecamp.org => Wes bos JavaScript courses => job. Looks like you‚Äôre getting a lot of support already. That is why it‚Äôs possible to make this transition. I‚Äôm sitting in a dentists office right now that a year ago I came to because I was grinding my teeth out of my skull because I was under so much pressure to find another career. It‚Äôs strange that now I‚Äôm exactly where I wanted to be, continued dental issues withstanding. It just takes persistence, when you feel dumb, like you‚Äôre not going to ‚Äòget it‚Äô, you‚Äôre on the right track. The feeling of confusion is the root of learning.

Would anyone be interested in a website that teaches c++ from complete beginner to more advance concepts?
There are 1000's of them already AND I would be 100% interested. Every site has a different teaching style, and I learn new and different things every time I visit a new place. It's entirely possible that your unique teaching style may resonate with a niche group of learners who have been struggling elsewhere.  
I'm right here with you. I think there's room for teaching almost anything *better*.  Especially with programming.   Something I personally haven't seen, and would LOVE, would be one that teaches, and explains differences from C to C++ to C#.  
C and C++ are both native languages. They do not require that much to run on most systems. C# is like a .net language, which requires dependencies to run on a system. Have you ever had to download a .net framework? That's because it's a dependency for a program you are running  
Thanks, but I meant in terms of syntax.  I learned C#, kinda, so I could get into game programming in Unity.  I'd like to know how much that translates into C/CPP. Maybe that's an idea for OP, if he knows all three - to create a C master class, which encompasses all three, or even also Objective-C (forgive me if that's not the same).  I don't know if that would be a good thing, or if they are so different that it would just be too confusing and better to focus on just one? See - there's already a need.  I need to learn all of THAT!

 or would i just be making something that hundreds of other people are already doing?  It would, but that's shouldn't be a reason to avoid doing this. We re-invent the wheel a lot as we learn. I'd say if you want to do this, do it for your own edification. Maybe you will have a teaching method that's truly different and changes things. Probably not; everyone thinks that their idea is different. But you should still try if you want. Just don't be disappointed if you're the only visitor to your site.  
Doing it for myself is a good idea. I kind of just wanted to teach it, as teaching is a good way to see how well you understand things yourself, and see what areas you need to learn more about.  
Things improve if you do have an actual audience that reads it and gives you feedback.  It's work to aim stuff at a total beginner, and even if you get good at that, it's so tiring that you often don't get to the advanced stuff.  And if you get to the advanced stuff quickly, you probably miss too much of the introductory stuff. Source: Have taught intro programming

Would anyone be interested in a website that teaches c++ from complete beginner to more advance concepts?
I 100% would be interested  
Would anyone be interested in a website that teaches c++ from complete beginner to more advance concepts?
I think you should. C++ isn't really taught by these modern online courses and I feel that is a big mistake. C++ should be the standard IMO.  
Would anyone be interested in a website that teaches c++ from complete beginner to more advance concepts?
Yes 100%. I'm a CS student and feel like my main resources are the textbook, lecture notes, and stack overflow which is just depressing to go on.  
FINALLY someone else who knows how utterly depressing that site is!  
Yeah, I try googling an error I get, honestly trying to look for ways to better my code and its just so many people on SO telling OP how they're an idiot and how they should go back to the basics if they can't understand this concept. It's seriously such a toxic website. If you're there to help, then help. Don't bring such negativity into it.

The effort alone you go through to give back to the community and find ways to open your content is fantastic.  I wish more curators, in this space specifically, came with this mentality and energy! Thanks Al.  
It's really amazing how tech can act as a force multiplier. I pay about $15 a month for my web host, but tens of thousands of people can read the book on my site. And this doesn't even consider the people behind the Creative Commons license and the Python Software Foundation. Learning to code a little bit lets folks make incredible leaps in productivity.

Great thanks so will there be a new course on second edition or same course will be updated with second edition content? super thanks for this.  
Eventually yes, probably mid- or late-2020. It won't be a separate course. People who sign up for this course will automatically get the updates once I finish them.

Went to use this but it was free without the code...?  
Yeah, the algorithm that Udemy uses for when they offer discounts and how much is kept secret. If they offer it for free without the code, then go ahead and sign up anyway. I just checked in my browser's privacy mode (but didn't hide my IP address with a VPN) and I only saw a discount (but not free).

Awesome, thanks for the course. Will definitely try to finish it. I think people do not finish courses because:  Starting something new gives a hit of dopamine (which is a neurotransmitter released inside the brain in ANTICIPATION of a reward, here the reward might be learning something new). But as soon as there is nothing new to that, people lose motivation and suddenly the course which for which you signed up willingly requires you to spend your will power. ( I might be wrong about dopamine here but this is what I currently understand about it, if someone can recommend a good book, I'd try to increase my understanding) Then comes the phase where we need to use our will to start that new video in the course which will teach the all important loops. But the catch about willpower is, it is limited and we can exhaust it on things that don't matter if we don't use it carefully. One can think of it as a muscle which can be trained slowly and steadily by lifting just enough weights that it won't tear apart but challenge it at the same time. The Willpower Instinct by Kelly McGonigal is a good book to read more about it.  Things people can do to tackle these problems:  Reserve things tha give you a dopamine hit for the time only after you finish one or two videos from the course (or perhaps even a section). For instance, I'll get coffee only after I finish this much. This way your brain will associate this activity of learning to getting a reward and you would love doing it. (Here one thing can go wrong though, we expect too much from ourselves but in reality we cannot do much, so its important to set short goals but the rewards should also be small. Not like feasting yourself with a 7 course meal after just one video :P). Tackling willpower can be tricky and easy at the same time. The best thing that works is building systems like saying "I watch one video first thing in the morning and one video before going to bed". This way doing the course becomes part of our daily routine and we don't have to go out of the way to type Udemy on the browser, then go to My Courses, then by the time we reach this course our phone beeps and the cycle repeats. Going out of the way requires will power. The tricky part here is that most people (including me :P) cannot (or will not) take out 5-10 minutes to just watch one video, but can scroll through YouTube all day. (I developed a habit of reading by reading just before going to bed)  All this information is mixed from these books:  Atomic Habits by James Clear The Willpower Instinct by Kelly McGonigal Deep Work by Cal Newport And YouTube Fill me in if you got more. :D  There is one more thing, which is, while starting due to enormous expectations from ourselves, we fail to accomplish our goals which leads to deterioration of motivation and thus we stop. The important thing here is to start extremely small and build upon only if we can. Otherwise just take baby steps to the finish. After writing all this, I might complete the course after all. Lets see, I'll just put the date here and update this post when I complete it. 5 Nov 2019

This or CS50 by edX?  
If it's harvardx CS B, that one uses C and is a general introduction course to programming.  
https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x I believe it‚Äôs this one. I‚Äôve taken intro classes before but want to learn again online. Leaning towards the Harvard one as it is more reputable from a resume perspective, which one would you recommend for a noobie programmer to start learning again? This or edx?

I did some spot checking to evaluate the quality and didn't spot any major problems. But I did notice your first three second and third array videos aren't valid C++ programs. You're using a common language extension, borrowed from C, called variable length arrays (VLA). In C++, array lengths must be a constant integer expression. Your compiler accepts it because it's being nice, but if you ask it to be strict (-pedantic in clang++ and g++), it will reject the program with an error.  
The first video is okay.  The problem starts in the second video, specifically the: int size = 5; double values[size];   
Am I correct in thinking this is only a problem if you're creating an array on the stack and it is fine to do it when the array is heap allocated?  
It's specifically the syntax: type name[size];  Where size must be a constant expression.  With the Variable Length Array (VLA) extension, you may use a non-constant expression iff the array has automatic storage (AKA allocated on the stack.) If you were to heap allocate an array, you'd likely use: type* ptr = malloc(sizeof(type)*size);  Which is completely different syntax, but yes it's valid since sizeof(type)*size is a function argument here, and doesn't need to be a constant expression. Regardless, these are both C constructs where in C++ we havestd::array (if available) and std::vector, which are strictly superior.

Awesome, thank you! Will have to check out the vectors tutorial soon. Had more trouble with that in my CS class than anything else  Edit: Is there a playlist link you can post? Would make it easier to follow the lessons that way

I know this is likely a completely newbie question to ask, but what do you type your code into on these videos? Do you have any suggestions on what editor to use?   
The FAQ has a link to the wikis tools page. you should start there.   
thanks, I'll check it out now.   
Yeah that's a great resource. I use Xcode in the videos, but there's tons of compilers out there. I recently came across the online compiler cpp.sh (that's the website) which seems pretty legit if you just want to try out C++ without having to download anything.

If you don't intend to go commercial with your code, I would HIGHLY recommend Visual Studio Express, basically free if your not selling what your making, has really good auto-complete, and probably the single smoothest code-to-exectuable path of any IDE I have ever used.  
Of course.  For me it's VS or nothing.  
CLion is swell.

These videos are also a great resource to check out:  https://www.youtube.com/user/1kingja/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=6 I had this guy as my teacher for a C++ programming class, and he is phenomenal at explaining concepts. If you find yourself stuck on anything in OP's playlist, maybe one of his videos can help you out!

I am brand new to programming. I'll give them a go! Thanks!  
From what I see, this teaches you literally everything you will learn from an intro to C++ class, except for maybe structs/classes. Definitely seems like something you should stick to.  
I haven't looked at it,  but the whole purpose of C++ is classes so will those be addressed in future lessons?  
I am brand new to programming. I'll give them a go! Thanks!  
Cool, let me know how it goes!  
sooo... just a question... do I need a program to program in C++?  
You need a compiler if you don't have a unix based system like Linux or Mac.  Try codeblocks for windows.

So far so good. I'm just watching the first one to see if it seems like it will help me in my 2016 code-learning plan.     I think it will work great. Thanks for putting it together.

As someone from an entirely different field, at a basic level, what can I practically do by learning c++ ?  
C++ is a systems programming language, meaning you can do about anything except web development with it. It is also one of the most powerful languages, meaning it is commonly used in the real world to do things that require up most performance, such as AAA video games (Call of Duty, Bioshock, The Elder Scrolls etc) or large bank systems. At a basic level, you could just create gimmicky text based games to impress you friends :P  
Just what I needed, Thank you!

shit man looked at a few before getting my thoughts your voice is really clear and nice to listen to, your mic isn't bad. Bookmarked this for future learning. It's so hard finding someone who teaches nicely who has a good voice and mic!  
Thanks for the feedback! I tried a headset once but it felt like I was in a call center, so I just go with my built-in macbook mic. Glad to hear it's working!

As someone who started by learning a decent amount of C and now wants to learn C++ where should I start so I avoid repeating a lot of stuff?

First off I can't thank OP enough for putting time and effort into sharing their knowledge. If I could ask you all a question. First, a little background: I'm a geography major with an emphasis in geographic information systems, and the primary programming language we use is Python.  I just took an introductory programming course covering Python and modules like Matplotlib/Numpy.  I've got to admit I still feel completely lost and am looking to school myself in the basics of programming.  I'm 30 years old of slightly above average intelligence, but I don't entertain realistic hopes of becoming a programming master. So my question is: if I want to beef up my programming skills, should I redouble my efforts exclusively on Python, or might learning and drilling in C++ give me a more solid framework for tackling Python anew? Or should I be tackling both?

I just finished my first semester of programming and the first full language I decided to tackle was C++. It's a very intricate language, any tutorial that can make the language simpler is a+ for me. I'll look into these over my winter break, thank you OP.

I started learning python 2 months ago and I‚Äôm addicted to your site man. I‚Äôm almost 200 XP and its the main practice ground for me. Thank you! If I can help anyhow let me know.   
Just keep using the site as you are! It's designed to get better and better as more people use it. Resources get submitted and voted on, the difficulties become more accurate as users rate challenges, interesting solutions are upvoted, etc.  
 It's designed to get better and better as more people use it.  Did you implement some machine learning elements into the site to accomplish this? Genuinely curious.  
Probably just more people voting, which gives a better result overall in regards to quality. Same way as votes on Reddit I assume

You should move from legacy python to python 3, legacy python is end of life soon   
He didn't say he's learning python 2. He said he started 2 months ago

Hey op could you look into golang in the future? Would be awesome, thanks for this!

Love the layout but I wish I could see the instruction and the code window at the same time like codewars and other similar sites.  
This. It's impossible for me to keep the instructions in mind and I have to keep switching back to them and disrupting my flow. Otherwise, I think this is a pretty awesome tool.  
The current layout can actually be a good thing, IMO. It forces you to be more mentally engaged and build mental models of the challenges you're doing. One thing I would also suggest is getting a pen and paper and writing down a plan of action for yourself before switching to the coding interface.   
You know that's actually a good point.  I think I'm going to start trying to do that with all my lessons / challenges.

Yes exactly. Also, having the code editor under the instructions... it just doesn't work in my opinion. It creates a very "clunky" user experience and is counter to how coding in the real world works.

This is awesome! Maybe add a 'Reset Code' next to the 'Check' button in the Code tab? Otherwise, this looks great!  
Good idea! I'll add it to the challenge dropdown menu.  
I second this. When I finished one and all tests passed, the 'Check' button changed to 'Submit Final'. I went back and modified some of the code to optimize it (typical practice for me is to tighten it up later) but I couldn't run the check again. I had to copy the code, refresh the page, and paste it back in.  Otherwise, I really like this! I have been meaning to do a little coding challenge every morning when I first get in the office, and this is great.  
When you ‚Äúsubmit final‚Äù it‚Äôs just doing another ‚Äúcheck‚Äù and if it passes you get XP. If you mess your solution up and submit final, it won‚Äôt actually submit the solution. Not until it passes. So I wouldn‚Äôt bother refreshing the page.

u/whoareyouagain: I originally thought by "reset" you meant reset the code editor to it's original state (the empty starter function). I think maybe you thought if you broke the code while cleaning it up and hit SUBMIT FINAL, it would insert the broken code into the database?  
I meant resetting it to its original starting point. Something similar to what Codecademy offers. When you fiddle around with the code wind up changing too much and just want to go back and start from the beginning. Essentially just reverting the changes we made to the code.  
Ok, so what I originally assumed. Perfect. I added the reset button to the dev build and it will go live this week. Thanks for the awesome feedback man!

Bookmarked, thank you for sharing! Any chance of a mobile app in the future?  
I'm pretty strapped for time right now but... maybe at some point? Coding without a physical keyboard has always been a dealbreaker for me so it's not something I've even thought about previously.

Hey, this looks pretty cool!  Is there any way to change the language of the UI that seems to be automatically set to the language of the country I'm from? Kind of confusing mix with the English of the challenges, haha.  
Hmm yeah I can see that being mildly annoying for sure. The only way for now is to sign in (so you would need to create an account) and set your spoken language to English. When signed in, click on your avatar --> Settings --> General --> set spoken language to English.  
Oh, great, that worked!  Thank you for creating this wonderful website. I'll be sure to check it out thoroughly!

Hey - LOVE THIS! One thing - After completing a challenge, if you look at solutions - do you still lose the xp?

I like it a lot!  I've been at my company for many years and am trying to move from QA into Development.  I failed my first interview many months ago however the company has many entry level developer positions opening up and so I am trying to gear up for another attempt.  This will definitely be one of the tools I use.   One thing I would like is to have the Check button and the Submit Final button be separate so I can continue to make changes to code once I've checked it once to try and make it better before I submit it as my Final Answer.  
You can already do that. The submit final button does the exact same thing the Check button does. If you break your code while cleaning it up and hit submit final, it won‚Äôt get inserted into the database and will revert back to the green Check button.  
I didn't realize that thanks for the heads up. From a usability perspective I still think it makes sense to have the buttons be separate because it doesn't seem immediately obvious to the user (wasn't for me at least).  
Yeah I agree, and you‚Äôre not the only one who has been confused by it. If I changed the text to ‚ÄúCHECK & SUBMIT FINAL‚Äù do you think that would still trip you up?

I'm looking to start but I have never learned anything. Like nothing. Do I need to learn a bit about let's say Java before I start doing these challenges?  
You need to know the basic syntax but that should not take you very long. After you got the basics, do some challenges.

What kind of programming are you trying to get into?  
For now, web-Development, especially backend and I would also like to make Android Apps one day. In the very long-term, I would love to get into /AI/Machine Learning  
give databases and the SQL language a shot, also. It seems like it wouldn't be creative but it's very fun  
I currently got sidelined into a database migration at work. Normally I do regularly software development.  I hate it. Massive queries with 400 lines and 10+ joins. Its a nightmare! From now on I will be the guy that does backend fixes. I do not recommend!

Oh ok nice, I‚Äôm into front end, mainly because it was super easy to learn on my own. If you have the time I‚Äôd suggest learning it. It takes less than a month and is really fun.

 It takes less than a month and is really fun  It's fun, but with a month experience you probably just know the basics of html and CSS and still struggle with Javascript. Forget building any kind of SPA or doing something more advanced.  Not trying to discourag anyone from learning front end developemt

Just some unsolicited advice, Golang is a great a language to start on and teaches you a lot about something called concurrency.  Most languages need external libraries or a lot of boilerplate code to create this functionality but go has some great tools to use. You can actually cache this website if you are in an area that has internet issues, and it has everything you need pretty much.  There are github libraries that can be super helpful, but there are a lot of good tools in the standard library. https://gobyexample.com/ If you can swing this course for $15 then it has everything you need to learn how to become a web dev, no pressure but when the time expires it really will be $50 again and might not come down for a while; however, there is more than enough free stuff on line to learn from.  The reason why I say Go is because it doesn't need something like Node to run, or take up a lot of space like Django, it can run on old computers for smaller businesses.  It can also be used for IoT and raspberry pies are at an amazing price for what you get out of it. If you are wondering about front end, then React is honestly the best; however take your time and really learn how to use these languages.  When you interview for a job, don't let them tell you "we can't hire you because you don't know Nodejs", tell them why they should build microservices in Go!  Just kidding but a lot of international countries are using it because it can handle large loads of data where things like Java can crash...hard...and Node has to perform asynchronous processes and use more computing power than if you used a concurrent language. I don't mean to be a cheerleader for Golang but it has a lot of advantages that other languages don't, and you learn about pointers.  I studied math in college and to be honest, Machine Learning isn't that fun, it's a lot of thinking and experimenting, think scientist more than engineer.  However, you know what is fun?  Gettin  your greasy mitts all over that sweet, sweet data that start-ups have.  You could push your way into AI or Machine Learning, but at the end of the day, those systems need data.  Therefore, learn how to cache and munge data on the service side, and you can work on your own AI, ML projects.  Most of the time these are in academia, and we really aren't trying to be "those guys" but learning and building new projects in  ML and AI are really just boring and repetitive.  Now once you get the core built, then yea, it's awesome...but in order to get to the cool parts you really have to understand linear algebra, stats, and the logical background of AI.  With all of that being said, if you are interested then definitely learn Pytorch instead of TensorFlow because of some things you will find out about later.  Now, when it comes to Go, I believe it has a bright future to compete (or work alongside) Rust in Machine Learning for IoT devices.  C and C++ are king, but when it comes to networking and http, nobody can truly argue against the supremacy with Go.  The subreddit is really cool and the main reason I stuck with learning it was the Gopher is just too dang cute. https://blog.golang.org/gophergala Cheers and enjoy problem solving. ‚Äã Afterthoughts: Read up on Solidity and make sure you check out https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY0xL8V6NzzFcwzHCgB8orQ Listen, he sells his bootcamp in every single video and ramps up the pressure to buy, but you can learn more than enough for free on his YouTube channel.  I've seen the bootcamp and it really isn't worth the money, yes it is harder to learn blockchain programming on your own but it is much more worthwhile.  Take care.

Continue doing it I achieved my goal and bought my first computer at age of 27 which was 2 years ago and I started programming I have got an engineering job in Germany now.  
Cool! Did you have any degree or career before getting the job?

In my humble opinion if you are willing to go into backend, you should learn a language the works both for web and for desktop apps such as Python. I feel that it gives you more flexibility and wages ar generally higher than with languages such as PHP  
Especially if you want to hop on AI/ML later, Python is your friend üôè

I'm happy for you really but Don't take me as a jerk but the real definition of a third world country is different.  ‚Äã What it really means are those countries which didn't aligned themselves with either US or USSR during cold-war era. It has nothing to do with being a poor economic country. Over years it's meaning is entirely changed which is wrong. ‚Äã Just some words of wisdom which this sub can take :)  
The term third world isn't widely agreed upon or standardized.  So it's meaning depends on context. For example, fourth and fifth world countries exist. Haiti is refered to as fourth due to its extreme poverty.  
‚Äã  context.   Taking the context in an incorrect manner is wrong itself & unless people stay mis-informed this problem will continue. During the Cold War, the United States, Canada, South Korea, Japan, and Western European nations and allies were categorized as First World countries. Second World countries included China, Cuba, the Soviet Union, and their allies. Third World countries typically had colonial pasts in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania.  ‚Äã Because many Third World countries were economically poor, and non-industrialized, it became a stereotype to refer to poor countries as "third world countries", yet the "Third World" term just includes all neutral countries some of which are economically prosperous like Finland and Switzerland. ‚Äã  For example, fourth and fifth world countries exist. Haiti is refered to as fourth due to its extreme poverty.  And this is why all these terms are removed in general English language and are replaced with terms such as developed countries, developing countries, least developed countries or the Global South.  
Fortunately, words and meanings change.    Take a gander at r/etymology if you haven't already; it'll shine a light on the losing battle you're fighting. Don't allow yourself to be pedantic about semantics. Instead of being prescriptivist, just accept that language changes.   Think of it this way: What version of 1st, 3rd world etc. is most useful in day-to-day speech?

Wtf is a third world country? Are you in a different dimension or something?  
You don't know what a third world country is?  
I always thought a third world country was an underdeveloped country but I recently learned that it means that the country didnt pick a side in the cold war.  
I think it's the other way around, it used to mean countries that didn't pick a side during the cold war, after it lost that making and started to be used to represent developing countries

After 2 years of learning programing, I knew how to write code, but didn't know how to make an application. So now, I'm writing the guide that I wish I had at that time. Here's part 1.
I'm glad to see more stuff like this popping up. So much learning covers basics but then no one talks about real world applications. I'm decent with Python but have no idea how to use it to make a user friendly program. It's a daunting gap of knowledge.  
I think you need to look up project oriented tutorials and courses. Corey Schafer's channel bon YouTube has good project oriented tutorials for Django, Flask and Data Science. You can also try out Python related courses from University of Michigan where you learn to build simple projects from scratch(Coursera). Also let me not forget Sentdex's channel on YouTube. He is certainly the king of Python for learners. He has great tutorials for covering almost everything in Python though the one's related to AI, Deep learning and Machine learning are the best one's. Don't get stuck in tutorial hell for long.

Oh my god, yes! This was so frustrating when I tried to learn Python a couple years ago... It's like there was this weird void between beginner tutorials that taught you syntax and advanced lessons that taught you like... I dunno, complex algorithms or something (they were well over my head, obviously) but absolutely NOTHING to bridge the gap between them.

I‚Äôm still working through html/ css and beginner at JavaScript. I have a ton of ideas I want to execute: -easybib clone  easy budgeter.  choose your own adventure (similar to Oregon Trail)  And I have ideas that are way above my knowledge base. I tried building an app through Apple‚Äôs app builder and got stuck at the graphic sizing part (loading assets and making them work). So I need to migrate to easier stuff and hone that.  It helps me to have an end goal. I‚Äôm building websites for clients, so I just rip ideas from other like sites. If a customer wants to show work, try a modal. If a customer wants to show a renovation, do an image overlay.  It‚Äôs really helped me to have a goal, rip ideas, and clone. The UI seems to just become reflex.  For me, two big issues: Firefox has a dictionary of stuff you can do. But W3 schools gives you models of what it will look like.  Instead of clicking for a modal, maybe a mouse over event...  
Hey, i'm mentoring a group of people of various level at the moment about frontend specifically. We are going trough basics/complex/real file cases so i'm online all day helping them while i work, guiding them without directly giving answers on how to do stuff, giving real world cases to solve, talking about the real market and how it operates, tracking their progress and setting up a learning path for their level. I can't really get you in the group, but i can help you out with general direction, answers questions you might have, giving you real life examples of the thing you want to implement, ideas of what you might use, or even just bounce ideas on who to do things.   If you like the idea hit me up by messages and we'll be in touch. Or anyone for that case, i can't mentor you but i can't help.   I'm doing it for free, so no gotcha or anything like that, just helping out the community.  
I appreciate that. This sub has always been chill. I don‚Äôt know what problems I‚Äôll have tomorrow. My biggest problem is blending JavaScript code.  I‚Äôll get this code and that code. They work on their own, but putting them together is a beast I‚Äôm working on.  I need to spend more time in the sandbox.

so many people do this and it's laughable. We're nowhere near decent in a language if you can't use it. For example, I can write some algorithms in Python and read python but since I can't make anything useful or can't hack with it, I'm basically shite at it. With JAvaScript I'm pretty good though  
 With JAvaScript I‚Äôm pretty good though  You got the caps lock delay? I can give you a fix if you‚Äôd like. Tested on linux only.

I mean, hate to say it, but that's literally what universities/colleges are for. I get that not everyone can afford that, especially in the states, but that's kind of a different problem. The resources are there.

My post comes from being a student a semester away from graduating who still does not know these things.  
and your uni doesn't offer any courses on system design or ui/ux design or similar? I am in my second semester and already have a standard lecture just for system design.

The resources are there? Not for everyone at all. I'm 32 working a full time job and have dependents. I've done the Uni and college thing back in my 20's. I want a career change and have to study around my other commitments and cant get into more debt that I'm already paying off  
After 2 years of learning programing, I knew how to write code, but didn't know how to make an application. So now, I'm writing the guide that I wish I had at that time. Here's part 1.
Honestly, thank you for taking the time to write/type this guide out and for sharing it with us all! I love that everything is broken down so nicely, telling us what to do and what to identify. Ill be looking forward to the part 2 of this! Although, I'm not really sure what it'll do or if it'll benefit you but I "clapped" for your article! I'd like to add that I dont really have any constructive criticisms to give you but I'd like to say that everything you've written is so to the point that it makes me feel better reading it.  I get tired when people write paragraphs upon paragraphs on a topic that could've been easily condensed into a few sentences that would have made it much easier to understand, though I understand that some topics needs to explained thoroughly so they're lengthy but oftentimes most of them do not need to be lengthy, just like this part of this comment, to further prove my point.

This looks really great.  Consider publishing it somewhere in addition to Medium. Medium is a cash grab and actually blocks your content from people in their attempt to charge users.

After 2 years of learning programing, I knew how to write code, but didn't know how to make an application. So now, I'm writing the guide that I wish I had at that time. Here's part 1.
How do you work with the security aspect of webapps and mobile apps? Anyone building apps may or may not be aware of testing if there are security flaws. How does one deal with it and how do you deal with them?

I've been struggling with this for quite some time. I would say I have some intermediate knowledge about my programming language of choice but I find it hard to plan projects... That's my biggest problem with courses and books about programming. Its sooooooooooo hard to find a course about programming that actually talks about how to plan projects and how to train your brain to think like a programmer(most of them just have a little chapter or a very little 10 minutes lecture on algorithms). I've been looking into content and talks about Computational Thinking/Algorithms lately and I found 3 books. If anyone is interested:  Think Like a Programmer: An Introduction to Creative Problem Solving - 2012 (this one got lots and lots of code with C++ samples; talks about a problem and asks you to develop an solution for it! very practical book). Computational Thinking: A beginner's guide to problem-solving and programming - 2017 (very theoretical and talks a lot about the process of planning/developing/arriving at a solution "that a computer can execute"; kinda hard to understand this book if English isn't your first language :P). Computational Thinking: First Algorithms, Then Code - 2018 (I haven't started this one yet but it looks like its a mix of the other 2 and a bit of commonly used algorithms).  I hope this information can help you in any way like its been helping me develop this meta skill :)

Excellent article! In my experience, requirements gathering and focusing on valuable requirements that generate real business value for the product or client is the first step most devs get wrong. I suppose that's the value a great PM brings to the table, but if you're a 1-person team then learning the PM side of development is super valuable. You've captured it so well in this article. Great job. Looking forward to the next installment. edit - looking through your post history I see you asked for something like this a year ago. I love the story behind this. Cheers!

Step 2 and 3 should be reversed, get yourself a MVP first, then make it pretty  
Thanks! This is a great point, and actually something I've been trying to deal with this morning. We want to get the general layout figured out , so that updating the MVP won't require re-writing too much code, but we want to focus the initial efforts on functionality.  So now I'm thinking I might have to break down UI/UX into two parts, one before step 3, and another after step 3 going into more detail. Appreciate  the feedback!

IMO starting coding by building stuff is good but you should ABSOLUTELY NOT start with mobile apps. It's easy to create a web app that is useable but mobile is a whole different game because of the very limited space. It really takes some good experience and understanding of UI/UX to squash a simple address form into a mobile screen. Something you probably not have when you just start coding. Something you might not even be that much interested in because you'd rather write server code. That's the reason why some apps look like "real apps" and some look like shitty apps for cheap bluetooth sex toys. Not trying to shit on your work here, but I strongly oppose starting out coding with mobile apps. Of course, you can do anything if you commit hard enough, do what you can't, yada yada. Getting into coding (especially in these days) is already frustrating enough. No need to go the extra hard routes.

One of my closest pals from school,  and easily one of the best programmers I know, hammers the concept of the importance of requirements frequently. And I agree. A few months ago I was working in an agile team and when I mentioned requirements, I might as well have been talking in another language.  I initially thought they were joking, they were not.

This is great. I‚Äôm very interested. Working as a software engineering intern right now and by FAR the learning curve of knowing how to code ‚Äî> being able to understand, create or modify applications has been hard to get through. This kind of tutorial could absolutely help us.  
Thanks!! When I started a job in software the code base we were working on was massive. I think that's the environment formal higher education caters to.  
Can you explain more on what you mean by the second sentence?  
Codebase in software just means all the source code for the application. This was a bank, online banking, and there must have been like a million lines of code at least.

I noticed that you didn't have anything mentioning accessibility in your article. Something like this is the perfect venue to bring attention to empathetic design when creating user stories and golden, paths through your app and extend an understanding of the different accessibility modalities users with disabilities use to interact with applications. Screen readers, switch controls, thinking about linear and logical meaningful sequences when designing user flow, it's all quite important and something most people miss or don't even think about until they get sued or lose out to valuable government contracts or federal funding since they aren't yet accessible.

Thank you very much for that. Now, to get laser printer because I like to have those things in paper form. Any books you recommend for c#, .net learning and programming in general?   
Well i have never interested with.net c# so i can‚Äôt suggest:(

I was pissed at Comcast(Time Warner) so I wrote another python script - This one tweets poor speed test results at them.
I like what you're doing.  I'd make some code structure tweaks. First, in all your classes you have an odd mix of class variables and instance variables.  When you do this: class SpeedTest(object):      download = ""     upload = ""     latency = ""     jitter = ""  You're defining class variables here. And then later accessing them as instance variables. If you're limiting things to only one instance it's still better to use instance variables here, by initializing them in an __init__(self): function. class SpeedTest(object):     def __init__(self):             self.download = ""         self.upload = ""         self.latency = ""         self.jitter = ""  Second, in your __main__, you 1) make a SpeedTest instance, 2) call its init_driver function to initialize a driver, then 3) call a method of your SpeedTest instance and inject that driver back in as a parameter. That's kind of wonky. What I'd do is have a separate class that would create and initialize a driver, then create a SpeedTest object with that driver as a parameter: if __name__=='__main__':     driver = DriverFactory.createFireFoxDriver(wait=5)     speedtest = SpeedTest(driver)  then  class SpeedTest:     def __init__(self, driver):         self.driver = driver  It makes sense since your SpeedTest class can't do anything without a web driver, so you can constrain instantiation to require a driver. Then you could easily test other web drivers if you so needed.  Third, Some naming schemes don't sit well with me. speedtest.get_data()  Implies that it would return some form of data. But that's not what's happening. Also, what happens if you call get_data() before you call run_test(driver)?  It looks like you'll just log that you couldn't find the data, which is good, but there's probably a safer way to deal with the workflow here.  Anyway, it's a good script. There's a lot of room for improvement and plenty of ground to get lost in feature creep ;-p   
You're awesome, this is exactly what I was hoping for.  Thank you for taking the time to go through it and provide clear, actionable recommendations.  
No problem. It's a really good exercise to write something small like this, then spend time refactoring it based on best practices. I always recommend reading Clean Code by Robert C. Martin. You can find pdfs of it online. Excellent read. Would definitely help you out.  
I've been looking for a 'best practices' book like that for a while - thanks for the recommendation! What would you say the prerequisites are for being able to comprehend a book like that? (E.g. I've taken a couple intro programming classes and written some scripts at work, could I jump into that book?)

Here are a few other random suggestions:   No need for so many getters.  All they do is return self.something, so there's no need for self.get_something()--just use self.something directly.  Some people think it's future-proofing, but that's not necessary with Python, because properties allow attributes to become methods without changing the API.  Strongly recommend using the logging module.  Saves a lot of time and adds a lot of flexibility and future-proofing.  In SpeedTest.get_data(), is TimeoutException really the one you're looking for?  Besides that, you could likely put all of those into a single try clause with a single except clause.  If it is actually necessary to do each one separately, it would be better to use a dict and a loop instead of writing out each try/except by hand.  Kudos on using whitespace.  I never cease to be amazed at the number of scripts I see in any language that have tens or hundreds of lines of code without any blank lines logically dividing them.  Lisp can sort-of get away with that, but in most languages it just makes it unreadable.  Suggestion: go all the way with PEP-8.  Use docstrings in your classes, methods, and functions.  They will help you in the future, when you return to this project after a 3-6 month break and wonder what does what.  Only takes a few seconds, and it also helps you write better code now.  The Twitter.test_results() function doesn't seem to belong in the Twitter class.  Generally, all classes should have an __init__ function.  Your Config class can sort of get away without one, since it's basically just storing config data, but since it does read from a file, it would be better to instantiate it yourself.  When you're putting together long, potentially multiline strings, it's generally more readable to use interpolation than concatenation, but I suppose this is a matter of preference.  The new f-strings in Python 3.6 will be really nice.  Overall, this is a really nice start, a lot cleaner than a lot of projects I see thrown onto GitHub.  Thanks for sharing, and keep up the good work.  I found this through a friend of mine who has a local cable provider that often gives very poor performance, and he may be making use of it to shame his ISP.  :D

Can I ask, as a relative newbie - what's with all the underscores? Why use two at a time?  
the double underscore denotes a magic method. when you use a magic method, "you don't have to invoke it directly. The invocation is realized behind the scenes." [source] If, when you create a class, you add an __init__ method, that method will be called automatically when that class is instantiated; you don't have to do manually do myinstance.__init__().

Should have just submitted a pull request at this point :p  
I thought of it but decided to leave the refactoring as an exercise for OP.   
Also, now /r/learnprogramming gets to see the suggestions and why they're important!

How's that 995Mbps number being measured? By default, provided the actual transmission rate is 1gbit/s (I don't have Google Fiber, so I can't say for sure) then when considering ethernet packet overhead, you shouldn't be able to exceed 985Mbps.  
I'm not sure, those numbers are about the highest I've seen for each however. I just remoted in to my home desktop and got 948 down and 973 up.

You should try checking if your modem supports the speeds you pay for. Been paying for 250 down 10 up with Comcast and was only getting 100~ down. My modem only supported up to 100~ mbits. Upgraded my modem and started getting the speeds I've been paying for. Hope this helps you out.

I was pissed at Comcast(Time Warner) so I wrote another python script - This one tweets poor speed test results at them.
Now if only it included a test for high latency and jitter. One of my client's Comcast connection has not suffered from bandwidth drops but it has from high latency during peak hours. I have seen latency measurements approaching 100ms and jitter of about 80ms. This makes VoIP calls and video conferences difficult.  
Check the code -> it scrapes and logs both latency and jitter, they're just not included in the tweet.  We would just need to add default values for them and a conditional to test the scraped values against the defaults.

Your title is confusing. Time Warner and Comcast are not related. Charter absorbed TWC and Brighthouse. Comcast is off doing its own thing, completely separate from everyone else like they always have.  
It's actually kind of triggering me because he did the same thing in his last post, and someone corrected him in the comments, and he acknowledged the correction. This guy just doesn't learn

Just check out this tasty FACT for your brainspace! Case closed. Now swear your fealty to Great Leader Comcast and perhaps you will be allowedd to live out your days at the labor camps service centers, working in service to the People's Champion.

I don't have speed issues with my Comcast, just losing internet all the time, so much so that I paid $10 just to get a program to track it.  I was working on programming my own but I was kind of on a time crunch so I could go to them with some kind of proof.  I work from home so internet is kind of a big deal, not to mention I don't have cell service at home so if I lose internet I lose my cell signal from my Microcell as well.

Sounds like that program paid for itself already.   
I don't have speed issues with my Comcast, just losing internet all the time, so much so that I paid $10 just to get a program to track it.

No real explanation, Nov 21-Dec 1 I had enough outages each day that they refunded me 10 days of service.  Not much money but it helps I guess.    
If you don't mind, what program are you using for this?  
Sure I use this one https://netuptimemonitor.com/ Wasn't trying to post it like I was a shill for them but it's damn useful and I've been using it for months.

I pay for 25mbps from comcast and almost always test at 30mbps, except when service is being weird and it's at 0.5. But still, on average I definitely get more than I pay for.  
Your one of the lucky ones. I'm paying for 150Mb/s and get only 40Mb/s.   
You pay for "up to" 150Mb/s, so anything over 0 is within contract. U-Verse rep actually said this to me.  
It's true the contract says up to but it means between you're current plan and the next lowest, not 0. If you pay for 18 it's supposed to be from 12-18. If you're getting under the next lowest tier consistently, then you're not getting what you payed for. The next lowest plan is probably 100Mb, though I think some areas have a 75 or 90 plan on fiber.  
Your one of the lucky ones. I'm paying for 150Mb/s and get only 40Mb/s.   
You're paying for UP TO 150 mbps

Nice, this could be put in a Raspberry Pi Zero and be running continuously on your network  
I did exactly this with a program I wrote to clone a twitter account (will auto-follow/unfollow users as the target to clone does, clones their profile background and avatar and, of course, tweets the same thing the target does (within a minute)) Have a raspberry pi just sitting on my desk doing it, love it.

So, on the topic of shitty ISPs: What is the best way to protest ISP contracts? Not sign up for them? Ultimately, you're just giving the ISP more money that way. I'm just so frustrated with this system right now. I'd just sign up for another, but the closest competitor has shitty speeds and occupation depends on a good connection.  
Talk with your state's utility commision. Theres different ways for each state. That or get a lawyer involved. They always can find the loopholes. Lastly, get a business connection and request SLAs. You will be majorly paying for the last though.

Very cool. Serious question: What's to stop ISP's from ramping up speeds when they detect you (or anyone really) are contacting a popular speed test site?

 Comcast(Time Warner)  Wtf does this even mean?  
That he doesn't know as much about who he pays for cable as he does about coding. Two totally separate companies.  
Or it is a clickbait title. He actually has TWC but puts Comcast because people flock to Comcast reddit posts.

Congrats man! I‚Äôm ‚Äúlearning‚Äù to code, and my parents think I‚Äôm some kind of prodigy, but I haven‚Äôt even touched my editor since school got out. I‚Äôm glad you have the dedication to learn something that I don‚Äôt. But I may revisit it after this post! Thanks for the motivation!  
Yeah man, a little bit every day. There were a few days in there I was only able to do 1 hour, and I counted that as a win.  
And with Udemy I find that even in an hour you can learn a lot depending on the instructor! Congrats on your journey so far :)  
I learned more with Udemy than in school. I remember we had some teacher and we wrote Hello world program in C++ for 8 hours. 1 hour at least went to him opening a web browser and then Google asked to accept the terms etc (which is normal when they update their privacy statements etc) and he started talking stuff like: "What is this? You see? Even Google has bugs" etc‚Ä¶ School was really a turn off for me.

It is more important to build a habit than to rely on motivation(whatever that is) if you want to succeed in life.

^ When I started getting back into coding, I coded every Thursday (This was in November) but I eventually made it a habit to code a bit every day, now since January I‚Äôve learnt HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and Python!  
You're so smart, I can't even get the basics of JS in a month, I moved on to Python as this seems a lot better.

This. This right here I struggle with so much. Motivation only lasts so long for me how do you properly build a habit? That's a simple question I probably know the answer too but I'm wondering what someone else thinks or if you have any tips  
I read somewhere that a habit sticks at about 40 days. Just don't put too much on your plate. Doing a little bit every day is way better than 5 hours in one day and then leave it for another day, week, month, etc.

I‚Äôm convinced there is something super valuable about not telling anyone about the work you are doing.  I am trying to decide how to best go about learning to code currently and will use this post as guidance. Thank you!  
There was a study done about this. Basically, if you tell people "I'm going to lose 50lbs, just started with this diet and this exercise routine, blahblahblah," you've already received a lot of positive feedback. No need to DO anything after that! But by keeping quiet until after the fact, you don't settle for the positive compliments, you're motivated to earn them. Something like that.

Can confirm. I‚Äôve told people I wanna goto law school and I was getting constant compliments. I didn‚Äôt feel so great after. I‚Äôm still going for it, but it‚Äôs a different feeling when you can surprise them.

So I read something about this a few years ago and never actually put it into practice until now.  The theory goes, when you share your goals you get a similar social reward to actually accomplishing your goal. As a result, the motivation to actually achieve it is somewhat diminished considering you can get a little serotonin boost just from mentioning it to your friends.  Idk if this is true, but there is something about the idea of just saying to my family in 6 months "Oh btw I'm a developer now" (this has yet to happen but since my family isn't on reddit, it's still a possibility) that's kinda exciting.  
On the flip side, someone who takes themself more seriously might actually find motivation by putting a goal out there and striving to achieve it, but this is dependent upon having a social group that will hold you to task. If I tell my friends / family ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do XYZ in 6 months‚Äù and fail, without having even put in solid effort, it‚Äôs extremely embarrassing

I regret not knowing about this later. Before I share it with someone nowadays I will be 100% sure they will be a positive force. I had someone tell me "well, that's just tic-tac-toe. it won't make you money" when I shared with them a project I was doing for learning's sake. I then had another who tried to be motivating... I think. But his reaction was so lukewarm that it only reinforced my already poor belief that my projects suck hard and I might fail to start a career. And now I read that positive comments may also give the impression that you already succeeded in doing something.  But then I realized, you're better off sharing your work with people who understand what you are doing and can appreciate the work that you're putting, give you constructive feedback and so on. I feel like sharing it with a non-techie person will at best make them smile "for social contract's sake".

CSS- The complete guide 2020 (Maximilian S., Udemy). I hated this course so much. Zero sense of aesthetics. The project and examples are so ugly. Just so hard to sit through. I dig Max's stuff but this one is so bad! Colt has a new series on youtube, I suggest you do that instead and get a refund for this.

How did you learn CSS before HTML, considering it's the language that dictates how HTML itself should be styled? And congrats!

This might be a little early for you, but something that can truly help your programming and software development skills is the (free) Nand2Tetris courses on Coursera (Part 1 and 2). Part 1 gives you an understanding of the hardware and logical fundamentals that underlie all software, by walking you through the process of designing a very simple computer from scratch. Part 2 walks you through creating a programming language of your own - understanding how languages are built and work under the hood can help you to appreciate the most effective ways to use them. The course is really well put together, with all sorts of materials available, and taught me a lot. It takes a task that seems gargantuan (creating a game of Tetris by first designing a computer and various levels of programming language) and make it really achievable - even if you have to scratch your head a fair bit too get through it at times! Good luck, and stay motivated Edit: typos  
That sounds off the wall. Reminds me of the Carl Sagan quote "If you want to make an apple pie from scratch you must first create the Universe."

It takes a task that seems gargantuan (creating a game of Tetris by first designing a computer and various levels of programming language) and make it really achievable - even if you have to scratch your head a fair bit too get through it at times!

This might be a little early for you, but something that can truly help your programming and software development skills is the (free) Nand2Tetris courses on Coursera (Part 1 and 2). Part 1 gives you an understanding of the hardware and logical fundamentals that underlie all software, by walking you through the process of designing a very simple computer from scratch. Part 2 walks you through creating a programming language of your own - understanding how languages are built and work under the hood can help you to appreciate the most effective ways to use them.

This is amazing, and so thorough! Congrats on your work, and thank you for this breakdown. I've been stood down from my job for a month due to COVID-19 and decided to ~finally~ spend some time doing personal study and upskill, so I'm effectively trying to set myself up for success as of about an hour ago (when you posted this). This is super motivating and a great guide. (Especially as someone prone to distraction!)

I honestly don't get why people shit on YouTube so much. It's honestly the only thing you need to learn programming. You will find literally everything about anything, and if a video lacks in explanation just do what actual programmers do and look up the documentation.  
I find the problem with video tutorials whether it's on YouTube or on Udemy or another website is that it gives you a false sense of competency when you're simply copying what the instructor is doing. This can all be avoided if you pause the video, take a few minutes to come up with your own solution, but a lot of people, including myself sometimes, are scared to let go of the hand-holding you get from them.  If you're completely new to the topic videos are a great start to get a feel for it, but you gotta attempt it on your own and/or modify what was created from the video into something different.

I've been too depressed to learn how to code. I wish I could make better use of my time. And also I'm really afraid I'm going to work super hard for no reason and not get a job or have that job be minimum wage or something. Everyone is learning how to code and I don't have a degree either.  
I‚Äôm a developer. I have no degree and I never did code boot camps or online courses. Shit, I don‚Äôt think those even existed like they do now when I started.  My recommendation is this- get a job at some sort of tech company. Preferably a small one. With some job like answering phone calls for a help desk. It‚Äôs low paying but it‚Äôs a foot in the door. Learn everything you can about the business and outperform every coworker. Start to solve problems. Take initiative to write code to solve those problems.  Not saying that‚Äôs THE answer, but that‚Äôs exactly what I did. And I have a very good career years later as a senior developer.  ‚ÄúLearning‚Äù is great. But ‚Äúinitiative‚Äù is priceless.

Just complete the freeCodeCamp responsive design certificate. It will get your started, doing a little is better than doing nothing at all. For me personally, coding is difficult, what ive learned from my gripes and programming is that the answers are all out there, you just have to ask the right question. If you ever need some help, let me know!

Based on the fact that you wrote this: "figuring out ‚ÄúThe right questions‚Äù to ask." and "YouTube: Avoid at all costs, honestly." - I think we can all agree you've learned, how to learn. I propose we bestow the title 'developer' to OP. Congratulations on the success.

You‚Äôre a beast dawg. Thank you for sharing all of this. I‚Äôve kind of been doing the same thing as you, started in mid-January with fundamental knowledge of if/for, functions and super basic oop- no web knowledge though.  Also did the web developer boot camp- learned quite a bit too. Will say that I think YouTube is actually fantastic. Web Dev Simplified, Fireship, Dev Ed, Brad Traversy, say no more... Also the honeypot.io channel has some really great light watching just to get a feel for the web development industry as a whole, what problems people are facing and stuff like that when you don‚Äôt have the mental capacity to write code anymore. Along with stumbling through blog posts and official documentation (Mozilla developer network ‚Äúmdn‚Äù especially), it‚Äôs been a bumpy yet really fun ride so far. Building stuff has certainly been the most enlightening part of the process for me (I just make endless mistakes about things I thought I knew, negative reinforcement really works for me lol) but getting some basic introductions was definitely necessary. Not sure about you, but I‚Äôd say my biggest hurdle hasn‚Äôt been getting distracted from coding, but getting distracted by the infinite things to learn and make. Like, what am I even supposed to be doing and learning??  What‚Äôs helped me is just saying ‚Äúfk it, I‚Äôm doing this Udemy course and seeing it through for the next two weeks‚Äù and trying my best not to resource hop. I‚Äôve definitely gone down some rabbit holes, but I‚Äôll take that over the analysis paralysis of ‚Äúoooh but do I do Udemy, freecodecamp, that University of Helsinki class, codecademy...?‚Äù. Eventually, I started just picking stuff and doing it. Right now I‚Äôve been trying to figure out if I should pick up Typescript or learn a SPA framework. Well, I‚Äôm just gonna send it and commit to learning and using Vue in my projects for the next few weeks. After that, I‚Äôll zoom out and see what the next move is.

This is amazing. Thanks for sharing! I‚Äôm going to save this and reread it. I‚Äôve recently started my programming journey....from ground zero.  I have a few rough ideas of what type of programming I would like to do, but getting off the ground ‚Äúboot camp style‚Äù is rough.  I think I found a simple project at work that I can incorporate some basic programming knowledge into that will help me get through the foundational skills. Wrapping my head around these concepts for the first time takes plenty of practice and interaction...not just watching videos.

It's weird for someone to be learning to code and not talk about it.  /s  
They probably are also vegan CrossFitters. Their self control knows no bounds.

it sounds like your rigorous "focus" noting and session timing is working against you. Why stop if the clock tells you to when your mind and body tell you otherwise? Sounds to me like youre training your brain to regularly break focus. Focus is a muscle that can be trained, and will be trained if you keep at coding. My attention span and focus have sky rocketed since properly started. The amount of stuff ive learned and understood when ive had what you'd call a break in focus is staggering, some of my best decisions have been made in the shower, at the store or doing something else, and my most enjoyable time spent coding has been when time has been all but forgotten. Its almost therapeutic, like mindfullness or some zen stuff like that. I dont know, havent really done that properly, but thats how I imagine its like. I think your whole approach to learning it in a fixed amount of time, timing your stuff etc. is just detrimental. Coding isnt physical labor, its not like stacking eggs in a carton, something you can easily measure. Its a mental and creative challenge, and that doesn't follow a clock. Some days you'll feel like you have done nothing, even though youve applied yourself properly to it, measuring and timing that is going to leave you with a sour taste in your mouth, even though all that fruitless struggle in reality was the most productive day you ever had, you just didn't reap the rewards the same day. Its easy to fall into this trap and think this way, I do it all the time, but it is just destructive way to look at it. Theres tons of research supporting this too, provision doesn't work on intellectual work, its a detriment, as it shifts focus from the real problem, towards the provision, and getting stuff done in such and such a way, on that time.  My advice would be to not force yourself to break focus, dont stress it, let your mind focus on the task at hand, not all this note taking and data collection on how youve spent your time. In that case, why not collect data on all the time youve wasted collecting data about your learning experience, to see how you could have spent your time more wisely?  im not saying dont take breaks, and dont go do something else, absolutely, some times you just need to back off, maybe youre in a rut, youve dug yourself so deep into a problem youve lost your bearings, doing something else can give you some space, and give you a new perspective. and like exercise, your mind also needs to recover.  
I couldn't agree more. A few points that maybe I wasn't super clear on in my word vomit post above.  The hour was just a benchmark. Before I started, I couldn't consistently keep my attention on coding. Some lessons I would completely glaze over. At those times I was lucky to go 30 minutes at a time, so thats why I was trying to build to 60. Which, is easy now and bordering (exactly like you're saying) holding me back a bit. I would code for about 3 hours a day. My shortest was just 1 hours and most was 6. But plenty of the day I would spend doing other things, and again exactly like you said. I would come up with my best solutions in my time daydreaming or when I was away from the computer.   What does a normal code block (or session coding, idk what the right term is) for you look like? Idk what it's like for actual devs because I haven't actually talked to any until right now, lol.

Keep it up. Having been in your shoes, I would recommend learning data structures and algorithms and solving 100+ questions on Leetcode.  This will help you (1) internalize syntax to the point you can write code in your sleep, (2) learn fundamental data structures like maps and sets, and (3) overall become more confident in your coding ability. Goodluck.  
This has been a problem for me, I haven't heard of Leetcode until now. I'll definitely look into it. Thank you!

Interesting approach. You're super thorough, a bit too much for me but that's in no way a criticism just an observation on different strokes for different folks :) My question is: what exactly have you been building? I think your post and approach might be more insightful and inspirational if you share some of the stuff you've been building, otherwise it may just look like another 'huge list of tutorials/sites/suggestions that worked for person X' Thanks for sharing. Always great to see how others are learning.  
I'll update this with a project I've made. Right now I'm just copying other peoples work, or building components and design elements just to see if I can, but no full applications that I can claim as my own. I had some hesitation to posting this at all, because really I had nothing of my own to show for it.

That is what I would like to be doing, but instead it's been almost fifty days since I ordered my computer parts.  The last two times I spoke to them they said my parts would be sent soon. Instead I just got an email saying that my refund payment will be processed in 3-5 business days. I've been on hold for forty minutes as of right now waiting on customer service. Forty six days, four (it's going to be at least five total) phone calls, an hour drive to the nearest city, and absolutely nothing to show for it. I'm going to find somewhere to write out the story coherently if this doesn't end soon.  
50 days?? Not trying to be a jerk, but I literally built my new machine over the weekend, and I ordered the parts last Monday. All that's to say idk where you ordered your parts from, but best buy, b and h, and newegg got me everything I needed in 4 days or less.  
It's a long story.  The short of it is that I'm in Canada and Newegg sent parts from California. They made it up here fine, but UPS doesn't drop off at rural locations. Instead they held it in a nearby city, and sent me an email saying they were trying to contact me ‚Äìliars. I finally got in touch with them, and ended up driving to go pick up my packages ‚Äìthey weren't where I was told they were. UPS then sent my packages back to California. It went to the wrong factory, so it just sat in the corner for three weeks. I have no clue what is going on now, because three hours is the max I am willing to wait on hold for customer support.

After reading your post I took a look at Colt Steele on Udemy.  One course costs ¬•24000 ( roughly around US$220, I guess) ((I am Japanese)). Is it really worth the money?  All the courses I have spent money for at Udemy was fun and easy at the beginning but then suddenly it became impossibly hard around DOM JavaScript, and I have to give up. I cannot seem to find good exercises like drills on basic staff.  Smart people always tell me to just go build things but I still don‚Äôt feel comfortable without practicing grammar of the language.  Any one has the same problem?  Or am I not askin the right question ? Congrats opüéä

I am not sure I entirely understand what he means by that  
That feeling you get when you take on a project you don't fully understand, when you hit a wall and you don't think you'll be able to figure it out, that uncertainty that you are cut out to even be a programmer at all, that fear. If you're not constantly in that feeling then you aren't growing and learning.  
Being challenged by your work and being afraid of it are different things.

Good to know, but realistically- how can someone devote 6-12 months learning one thing? These days to become even just a front end dev you need: some knowledge of the back end, usually a web framework.  html  css javascript whatever front end library is cool these days Database query languages like SQL/ Mongo testing and testing frameworks  some deployment these days something like docker and kubernetes You're looking at at least 3 years of learning, and this isn't even for a back end or full stack dev.  As for me, I graduated from a part time bootcamp at the end of 2019. Learned Ruby, Rails, Js, React/ Redux, html, a little css, and a little SQL. I hit interviewing and had never even heard of big O. Now almost a year later, l have had around 5 interviews progress to second round and have not made it farther. I've tried to fill in the gaps. I agree spreading yourself too thin isn't smart, but someone in my position cannot spend a year on javascript alone.

Could you elaborate on "charisma is king"? If your friend got the interview for a job with "ridiculous" requirements it probably means that they fulfilled atleast most of the requirements, right?  
I think it means if you‚Äôre a likable person with a good ambitious attitude and willing to learn, you can get into positions even if you don‚Äôt tick every box the HR person put.

6-12 months on one STACK. Choose a stack and master it. A stack may have 1 language, 3-5 libraries, and 2-3 different backend technologies you have to master, but you learn them in turn, as you build things. So really, that's 6-12 months of building things with your chosen stack.  
But be ready to bail on that stack when it becomes a liability. A friend of mine re-entered the job market after 20 years of Classic ASP. Slim pickin‚Äôs, there.

What us a Stack?  
It's a series of languages, libraries, and frameworks that all "go together". For example, in the world of Javascript, React is your front end library/framework, NodeJS is the backend tool, with express, Gatsby or Next as libraries that assist that. Your NoSQL database is MongoDB which works well with Node and Express. and So on. There's the MERN stack (Mongo, Esxpress, React, and Nodejs) the MEAN stack (Angular instead of react), the LAMP stack (I forget what it stands for but PHP and MySQL are the M and P) and so so so many others - stacks involving C# and .NET core, other .NET stacks, and even architectures involving use of extensive AWS resources. There are stacks involving Django or Flask (Python based backends) as well. There are too many to know. The key is to get your base of understanding - know HTML, CSS, and JS, learn how to use a language well, and then choose a stack. Explore a lot, watch tutorials, really think about it.

Good to know, but realistically- how can someone devote 6-12 months learning one thing? These days to become even just a front end dev you need: some knowledge of the back end, usually a web framework.  html  css javascript whatever front end library is cool these days Database query languages like SQL/ Mongo testing and testing frameworks  some deployment these days something like docker and kubernetes You're looking at at least 3 years of learning, and this isn't even for a back end or full stack dev.  As for me, I graduated from a part time bootcamp at the end of 2019. Learned Ruby, Rails, Js, React/ Redux, html, a little css, and a little SQL. I hit interviewing and had never even heard of big O.

On the other side there are many professions where a degree is a hard requirement. No one is going to become a lawyer, accountant or doctor by doing a bootcamp and some online courses, not even after 5 years of doing that. The fact that you can become a software engineer without ever going to school or from a completely different background is amazing to me. It's a very good thing. Yea it sucks that getting hired is hard, but there's not much to be done about it, it's supply and demand.  I don't think it's that weird to spend a lot of time learning one thing either. I also started with sort of a bootcamp and while it certainly helped me learn the basics of Java, JS, HTML and CSS I'm still learning a ton about JS even after working with it for 2 years. I just now started learning React. Even colleagues that have been programming professionally for 10 years still have areas of their expertise that they haven't even touched yet. There's a whole world out there of stuff to learn.

Agreed. I think spending 6-12 months on one technology is a bit excessive if you're trying to get hired. Though, I can see it being useful if it means "one tech stack."

Big O notation is about optimization, unless you're going into real study of the subject, everything else will focus on deploy and ship. However, if you put 6 months into learning a language that is going to come with an intense amount of carry over to other languages. Java, JS, C, C++, C#, Python, etc etc etc. All have so much carry over because they all use similar concepts in mostly similar ways. There's a ton of jokes about developers copy/pasting from stack overflow etc. Its all too true, but it's mostly because it's about the knowledge that something exists. If you study oop languages, you'll learn about boiler plating and interfaces, so when you get to a task in a new oop language you'll say ah, I should search for the documentation on interfaces within this language. You may end up at a stack overflow for your exact problem/implementation. When you've spent a lot of time learning the ins and outs of one language, you can easily find the ins and outs of the others.  But at the same time, it also depends on how you study, if you study javascript for 6 months, but you study it in a vacuum, you've missed out on time you could've spent getting an apache server working and setting up a small website and and connecting with mongodb, etc etc. If you're working within a stack, you want to learn the stack not every individual part and then put it together. Its sort of like school, you didn't learn only math for a year then history, then science, you learn them all at once. That's just my take on it I guess though. As for the whole you have to learn everything to get a job, if you are competent enough in most aspects, you can learn while on the job. I had only worked with C# a tiny bit before getting hired on as a junior full stack on an ASP.NET webapp. But I knew enough of other languages that I only took a couple of weeks to get used to syntax and basically was rolling again. it also depends where you get interviewed, startups can be more lenient, etc.

Great advice!  Alot of things sure hit home.  I will say that I'm now using Anki for Spaced Repetition.  In my job as a SysAdmin I often do tasks only once every few years.   Several times I've forgotten or didn't write it down and spent weeks unraveling it.

Thanks man, I really needed this today. Especially the fear part and the consistency part. Often times I've let myself slip into "last minute cram" mode for 2 hours and then get frustrated and intimidated when I don't have it figured out right away. And then that spirals into "Well I tried my best for 2 hours just to get this small thing almost figured out, so I must be really dumb," and then I have to fight more avoidance and procrastinating to get back into it. I think I'll just take it small chunks at a time, and maybe try to frame that nervous feeling into excitement and challenge instead of fear. Thank you for that friend :)

It might take some time to learn what you like most. If you‚Äôre more into backend or cli stuff, it might worth it to take a look at Go. I‚Äôve switched around between a few languages before finally switching to it for most of my projects. I primarily do CLI and networking stuff, with the occasional web project thrown in. I like the infrastructure and architectural part of programming and systems administration, so I build tools to support connecting things together.  You also don‚Äôt need to know one thing all too deeply; I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs nice to have a wide range of knowledge that you can later supplement with domain specific stuff that you can learn as you go. So it‚Äôs important to know how networking works is important, but knowing how Go‚Äôs net library works is much less important because you can always look it up and things do change over time, so it‚Äôs a good idea to look at the docs regularly.

 As you learn and experiment, pay attention to the kinds of tutorials that work for you. Many will not work. That‚Äôs fine. In fact, that‚Äôs exactly how experiments work until you find a solution.   After you strike gold, stick to it, consume it voraciously and then find similar tutorials like that to continue rapid growth.  This is me. I've determined that the best tutorials for me come from Brad Traversy, I don't know why but I love his style. I'm going to stick with his tutorials basically forever until I exhaust his supply. Since he uses so much MERN stack, it also plays into the last point:  Master One Thing   ...   Pick one thing.   Stick with it for a few months ‚Äì ideally 6 to 12 months before you move to something else.  I've committed to learning and mastering the MERN stack. There are so many good resources to learning it, it's up and coming, and you can basically build anything with it. I'm not even going to touch Django until I've built 6-10 apps with MERN, and I think that will help me to make progress way faster than if I just splattered my attention on every stack known to man. Ben Awad has a great video about this as well, and reiterates that with React, Gatsby, and Next, you can basically build anything you'd need to have a career. So get started.

 You‚Äôll meet a**holes  All the worst people I've encountered, which are thankfully few and far between, have been pretty evenly distributed among different career paths. I think there's some heavy confirmation bias in this field, it's not any worse than any other.

My comment will probably get buried but I gotta say this: I've met those a**holes. I'm in that rut. I'm constantly scared. I'm about to graduate, my peers are better than me and constantly remind me how better they are and how they have opportunities just handed to them. Finding the motivation to just push through obstacles has become extremely difficult. My peers/friends won't help me, I'm all alone. I am trying to study MERN or just React and competitive programming(leetcode). I need advice, I just feel like I need advice...

Could you elaborate the "work within fear" point. Are referring to the "I don't know anything" or "this is all new to me" fear?  
I'm referring to both and beyond. Fear could also be:  - "I'll never get this."  - "I'll never know past this level." - "I got this job and they'll soon discover I'm a fraud!"

Something my high school coding teacher told us: When you're learning something, type it all out so you get used to writing it and seeing it. You'll understand it more than if you let auto-complete and copy/paste do all the work for you. Once you know a thing or two, you can let the auto-complete do a thing or two

Great post, but just wanted to note that I don't think the quote cited below is particularly accurate, as programming is a fair bit more arbitrary, as you're learning to work with systems that were made arbitrarily; underlying associated skills like logical reasoning, however, aren't, but still that's pretty basic and more or less something you either have or don't-there's little that distinguishes one's ability to reason logically from another's, whereas with something like music, which seems more innate, intuitive, creative, etc. Logical reasoning itself, and symbolic thought, are intuitive too, but the syntax and structures designed for programming generally aren't. Creative talent is indeed more of a factor with music, whereas programming is more analytical.  But becoming a proficient developer is like playing an instrument. Only a tiny few are born talented.  Really anyone can program, and I don't think it's something that really requires much talent, but does require work and commitment to learning the systems and how they're supposed to work, and that can be challenging, especially since the concepts aren't always clearly explained, people tend to use overcomplicated jargon, etc (honestly I think many in CS do this intentionally, maybe to sound smart. In comparison, subjects like math and physics are really clear with having apt terminology and conceptual clarity. They don't try to make things artificially harder for people who try to do math or physics, and that's how it should be for programming and everything, but typically isn't). Anyway this is the real challenge, as your post conveys: to find resources which will communicate things comprehensively but as simply as possible. There are many resources out there that will show you what to do, but not explain what's really happening, and there are many that will seem almost encyclopedic, which can be a good thing, except many won't actually go into full detail, or will stop short on concepts, not going up or down in abstraction. Eg when I was first learning JavaScript I'd look at MDN's pages on classes, trying to figure out how exactly classes and functions were related, and it states some things very formally, but also by reading its examples, you'd realize there were many smaller details that weren't explained or even touched off on at all. I don't recall them talking about protocols much either; they didn't go into much depth there.

I'm 34 trying learn JavaScript through grasshopper. I have an automotive mind so running through logic shouldn't be that hard to understand. But have you or anyone else use grasshopper. I forget the syntax (think that's right) any way to increase memory retention I get spatial practice to say but when I go to practice let's say a couple of boxes moving side to side I get lost what to do first and then begin. Want to change/start a career and I started on those old school I think Tandy computer that hooks to TV. So I did early version of coding before 4th but then started moving and lost it. Does just come down to confidence maybe I should started a new post sorry but any help would be helpful and appreciative damn covid lost job and a little lost

This is a great read. For newcomers yes, but even a few years into my career so much of this is relevant. My first year in a new job was spent jumping around between different areas, to a point I didn't feel confident in any area. There are absolutely a-holes. Sometimes disguised behind a smile.

Thank you for this. I've been slogging at Python, Java, and god know what else for years. This year, I found to the Microsoft learning paths and not only does the Python finally click, I was able to take a test for a coding bootcamp and did much better than I thought I would. The information was in my brain, but the tutorial I found was the first to make me feel like I was able to apply what I've learning.  I want to go into Data Analysis and currently I have an internship in log management. But it is very much self guided and when I searched the internet, there was so much that I become overwhelmed. But I went back to Microsoft and realized there was a learning path for data analysis that is the continuation of the Python learning path. So that is where I'll stay because I know it works for me

 New devs tend to jump around learning a lot of things. Okay, it‚Äôs not just new devs; it‚Äôs also experienced folks. You learned React for one week. Then Django for two weeks. Laravel for three. Stop. You need to wake up and realize that the harsh truth is that you‚Äôre simply extending the time it‚Äôll take you to truly learn anything.  Felt like I got called out here. My nephew told me pretty much the same thing.  I've been studying programming since 2016 and I am still a pretty bad noob. I feel this hard. On one hand, I feel like I need to learn more to have a big CV in order to get hired. On other hand, I feel like I am not good at anything because I never specialize. Every time I am trying to deepen my knowledge, something diverts my attention, like being asked to do a job. And I botched a few so far*, my CV is totally empty on experience.  I wish I could just sit down incomunicado in an isolated location with internet, food and water, where I could spend days on a computer, just learning programming by myself and only getting out until I am the programming god I know I should be by now. It just ins't right, it has been four years, I should be a programming god by now!  *to be fair, one was shortly after my cousin died, the other my computer broke and the current one, another one I took too long (because nobody back then told me that Bootstrap and vue.js are like water and oil and assumed they didn't care any more, and in my latest failure,my employer decided to do it himself because I went incomunicado in a bit of total tunnel vision because I was too focused on learning skills I needed to do it rather than giving him constant updates.

This is awesome! I always wanted something to test me as if it was a real word job and I think this hits right in the target.  I'm definitely trying this one out and will look forward for more challenges!  Thank you!!  
If you are interested in frontend dev, there's a set of challenges here: https://www.devdrills.io/drills  
Honestly? The responsive design for mobile of this site I should be a challenge on its own  
Valid point, if you are talking about the table view it's going to be improved soon. I am currently working on adding a preview to user submitted code. Sorry it's not in a good state(most of the dev practice happens on the desktop so it's a bit better than the mobile experience) but I would love any constructive feedback especially around the quality of the questions as they are the only thing I have put focus on, rest were stitched together in a week to see if it's even worth putting in the time.

Check out Wilco, that's literally what it's designed for. I tried it out and used to joke to my wife that after work I'd be "going to work" for my second job, and open up Wilco. It literally feels like you started a new gig, Slack clone included. I'm still quite early in the learning phase so I decided to stop and focus on coding, but closer to when I start applying I'll definitely pick it back up to to make the transition to the real world as smooth as possible.  
Do you want to simulate a real software engineering job?
Not what I'm studying right now (reviving and expanding on old Python knowledge), but I love the concept and build of this simulator and will keep an eye on it and likely come back to it sometime. Seems like a cool idea.  
Do you want to simulate a real software engineering job?
This looks cool. I can see how with enough time and resources, this can be scaled to accomodate differing difficulties and scopes. For instance (I will call them "Levels" for a lack of a better term), here are some possible tasks breakdowns (in the context of web development): Level 1: Simple functionality changes like changing a button, updating texts and headers, rearranging and realigning objects, color adjustments, etc. Level 2: Tasks involving changes to parts of a single webpage (basically different combinations of Level 1 per tasks per assignment). Level 3: Tasks involving changes to a single entire webpage (basically different combinations of Level 2 per tasks per assignment). Level 4: Tasks involving changes to parts of multiple different webpages (basically different combinations of Level 3 tasks per assignment). Level 5: Tasks involving changes to multiple different entire webpages (basically different combinations of Level 4 tasks per assignment). // Then the scope here changes Level 6: Tasks involving creating an entire basic webpage (the general pseudocode and framework has been provided, but everything else still needs to be made). Level 7: Tasks involving creating an entire basic webpage from the ground up from scratch. Level 8: Tasks involving not only creating an entire basic webpage from scratch but also incorporating other technologies and services to further expand its scalability, security, efficiency, and robustness. Level 9: Being given vague, arbitrary, and abstract specifications and determining which technologies and services would be most appropriate to achieve the technical and business goals of the desired product of the client (delving more into system design and architecture territory). I can definitely see how in the far future, levels 6 to 9 can be simulated using your product. Perhaps you could also incorporate different languages and frameworks as well as a online/offline team-building feature (where you can invite your friends, colleagues, or classmates to take on one of the levels given a timeline so as to simulate a collaborative working environment). Of course, you can also could also allow other products to be made other than websites and have a corresponding level scale for them. At this point, I've been rambling a lot but nevertheless, this is a cool idea and I would love to see where you take it!  
I am mostly self taught. I have found that while I can create things from scratch. It's really difficult for me to understand others code and build upon it instead. I think this is a really important skill to have, something a lot of tutorials don't teach.

Do you want to simulate a real software engineering job?
This is a great resource. For anyone reading this, this is EXACTLY the type of work I had to do right after being hired after college. Definitely recommend using this!  
How long ago was that?  This seems to be FAR easier than what I would expect in my first few weeks.  I think in the real world you should expect to be working on a much larger codebase, stepping through a debugger to figure out what modules are interacting with each other, and working with internal libraries/frameworks that you have never seen before.  
Yeah this was more my experience. The actual code I wrote in my first few weeks was super simple, but the challenge was grasping the massive codebase, finding where in it the thing I was fixing even lived, understanding the related libraries, and setting up local environments which ranged from easy modern docker dev environments to some archaic legacy shit with no documentation that would take me 2 days to even get running.  
Bingo.  The end goal was pretty similar (center this element, remove validation from this input, apply relevant styles to match this mockup etc.) but the massive codebase is where the real challenge is.  It could easily take all day to do any one of those things.

Honestly this is still the hardest part of starting in any new project/team even as a mid-level engineer.

i don't have anything for cpp right now. If more people upvote your comment, I can def add it to the roadmap! I've made vanilla css/html/js challenges, and they seem to outperform everything else (React, Andular, etc) at the moment.

Are these like problems that occur in real jobs? Because these seem way too easy for that, and who is using Vanillajs in real jobs anyway? I am not trying to be hateful, I just think simple email/password validations and changing the name of a file in html does not simulate a real job. The code is also simple enough that it doesn't improve "reading other people's codes". Here are some tasks I think would be a little more challenging but still beginner friendly. ‚óè Frontend ‚Ä¢ Create a dark mode/language toggler that changes the current mode/language to another, you don't actually have to implement the dark mode/different language itself, just make sure changing the toggler on one page, any page, reflects the changes throughout (just add a text on every page that shows the current mode/language). Do you think it would wise to use Redux for this? Why or why not? If yes then implement it. ‚Ä¢ Create a loading screen for an asynchronous action while it is happening. It could be anything, for liking a button, getting data from an API just anything. Don't need to animate anything, just show a text like "data loading" during the action. ‚Ä¢ Create a mock server using json-server and create CRUD helper functions to communicate with the server. You can use Fetch, Axios or anything else. ‚óè Backend ‚Ä¢ Implement a register function that takes the username/password from the request body, validates the username and password (username must be over 5 characters long, password must be 6 characters long, have at least one capital letter and one integer. Then encrypt the password using something like bcrypt and save the user object. No need to save it to actual database. Printing the final validated and encrypted user object is enough. ‚Ä¢ Create a PUT method of an endpoint that edits a record in a database. Considering the database already exists and is given to you. Send appropriate response for successful edits or common errors (like that record doesn't exist, the field you are trying to edit doesn't exist). What would you do if 2 clients theoratically make request to update the same record at the exact same time, causing an edit conflict? How would you handle that? ‚Ä¢ Create a logger and errorLogger functions that log every action that happens to the api (like request method, request body, response headers, error messages etc) to the terminal. logger prints the normal actions and errorLogger prints all the errors. The routes are already built for you.  
Great feedback. If enough folks upvote your comment, I will look into building some of the challenges you've mentioned. Really appreciate it!

When the read me says to submit a PR to ‚Äúthis‚Äù repository, does it mean the one you forked? I‚Äôve never actually dealt with forking a repo before, so I don‚Äôt know what it does or how it works.  
When you click the fork button up top on the project repo page you will create a fork. This fork will be a copy (fork) of the repo, under you own github account. Once you‚Äôve made and pushed changes to your fork, github will offer to let you create a pull request back to the original repo. Create that pull request, and you will see our automated tests start running.  If you have any issues, pm me for help. üëç

I (self-taught) had my first-ever interview for a web dev job yesterday. Here is what the interview was like and the questions I was asked. [Long]
Links below are some useful links to get your ready for an interview of this kind: React interview questions: https://github.com/sudheerj/reactjs-interview-questions Js interview questions: https://github.com/sudheerj/javascript-interview-questions Filter the conceptual questions that are likely to be asked and try to go through them everyday. Best of luck! edit: I've just gone through the questions again and noticed that most of the questions you were asked were picked up from these links.

Thank you for psoting this.  I am self taught too and been applying for 2 months now with no one reaching out to me  It's a bit disheartening but seeing what they asked you has me scared because I feel like I cannot answer most of those questions.  So perhaps I should stop applying and keep my studies going for now.  Even after completing an online bootcamp and doing UDemy courses, it seems obvious to me now that I still don't quite know what I am doing.  This was a big eyeopener and I really appreciate you taking the time to write this up for all us beginners!  
The best advice I can give you is to try to build a project of your own. I felt like my understanding of a lot of concepts solidified when I had to try to figure out how to make things work without the crutch of a video to tell me how, especially when I added Firebase to my project. I didn't know what a promise in JS was before I had to use them to make Firebase work. I read a lot of docs and StackOverflow topics, and it still sometimes took me hours or days to figure out bugs. I was able to stick with it because it was my own project, so I was more motivated to make it work.   Good luck in your learning and your job hunting. Stick with it, and keep applying as you go.  
I do need to think of my own project.  The apps I built in the bootcamp felt so easy since I was sort of "coding-along" if you will.  I can read the code and understand it but I get so stumped when I need to do it on my own.  Thank you for your words of encourgment!  I am going to try to think of something to build for myself this weekend!  
Fellow self taught dev here, a neat trick I found to decide what project to do is think of a really small part of your day that would be easier if the computer did it for you, e.g. me and a friend used to text each other when a particular wine was on offer. I used this and wrote a quick script that scrape‚Äôs the websites of the supermarkets we shop at. Then add layers to it. How can I make this a server to add new items and check the latest prices? How can I generalise it so it‚Äôs not just the wine but all items at supermarket? How can I add notifications when the price changes? I‚Äôm now planning on adding a front end so that users can track their favourite prices. It‚Äôs small but I‚Äôve found the smallest little idea can be built upon and dressed up to become a full stack application. I‚Äôm clearly over engineering this but it‚Äôs a toy for me to experiment with new concepts. E.g let‚Äôs add typescript, let‚Äôs add prisma, let‚Äôs move to SQL rather than a json file as the db.

OP advice about building your own project is super critical. I self taught (still have much to learn) my self enough python to move from my last job to my current one. However, for like maybe 3-4 years i was on this on and off path were I would start a course and then a few lessons in I would stop(for various reasons) but one was definitely that I didn't feel I understood what I was learning (from reading many comments it seems thats a common theme) It was not until I was at my last job (which had nothing to do with programming) that one day I was fed up with redundant time consuming task and I went back to learn and applied as I went (I suppose that was my project) and everything finally began to click and I began to understand it and enjoy it. So my take away is start a project and find something you have an interest or something that is relative as your project. That will make the learning experience easier. Sure you can pick a random project but if it has no personal meaning or ties to you it might just be tedious. Hope my 2 cents help. :) either way keep applying you never know when someone might be looking for someone they can teach on the job.  
I have actually built about 10 apps thanks to the bootcamp I took but for whatever reason it doesnt really sink into my brain.  I have a few more extra apps I am going to build that I didn't need to finish the bootcamp so hopefully completing those will help too.  Recently I have been focusing on codewars and trying to complete kata's but those are just as hard. ‚Äã I am where you were too.  I just can't with my curent job (a sales role) and I am not getting younger (just turnned 37) so I am trying to spend about 4 hours a day on this.  I really like front end work more than back end so I have sort of been focusing more on Java Script recently.

Are the apps you build guided projects? I found that I couldn‚Äôt learn until I started taking everything into my own hands‚Ä¶ I work in data science though so might be different‚Ä¶. Just keep going I know you‚Äôll find it! I‚Äôm currently in a 4 1/2 month job search slump too so I‚Äôm right there with you! It can truly destroy your soul especially when you know you‚Äôre capable of the work.

A lot of programmers deal with imposter syndrome. It‚Äôs hard to feel like an expert when I have to copy/paste hooks from the React docs because I don‚Äôt have it memorized. I have a bachelors in CS and about 5 years of professional experience with React with 3 different companies. I don‚Äôt know any other front end frameworks, I specialize in React, it is my safe space. I have made browser extensions, phone apps, and countless web apps in React, and I don‚Äôt know what a ‚Äúmixin‚Äù in React is. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to answer the typescript questions, and I might struggle with a few of the other questions because that‚Äôs not my specialty. I can do Node and database work, but it wouldn‚Äôt be as fast or pretty as someone who specializes in those areas. It‚Äôs okay to specialize. It‚Äôs okay to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù. I think it‚Äôs literally impossible to know everything in the JavaScript world. It‚Äôs just too big. Do what you can, and don‚Äôt give up.

Embellish your resume, get interviews, and learn through interviews. It will show you your blind spots. You don't have to take the job of you don't like.  Web development market is hot right now, I'm not sure why you aren't getting interviews.  Add a fake start-up to your resume to give yourself work experience.  Use indeed one-click apply. Apply to companies all around the country.   Even if you aren't interested in moving or working for them. Just get some interview experience.   When started looking for work, I did this.  100 applications in a week.  Interviewed a few times, got an offer.  I faked it till I made it.  Worked with that company for 5+ years and changed for a pay increase.    I recommend lying on your resume.  Don't let them make you self-filter.  Just interview a lot.

I would strongly recommend doing a course on coursera called "Learning how to learn" or read the book "A mind for numbers" which contains basically the same info, the course is free, but it's given me lots of insight on actually learning stuff and understanding instead of mindlessly chipping through content and later forgetting everything in the next days.  
Hi, what would you say are the top concepts from those books that help you the most?

I (self-taught) had my first-ever interview for a web dev job yesterday. Here is what the interview was like and the questions I was asked. [Long]
In one of my previous junior roles I was asked really similar questions in the interview. I was able to answer 90% of them and was invited to the next round at end of the interview.  I‚Äôd strongly recommend to any newbies to challenge themselves to build a full stack site only using the techs documentation. No stack over flow or similar sites. If you get stuck , pull up the documentation instead and find the section related to your problem. 9 times out of 10 you‚Äôll be able to find the solution to your problem and you‚Äôll understand the tech way better as you‚Äôll pick up more context along the way.

If you get stuck , pull up the documentation instead and find the section related to your problem.   This is less of a recommendation and more a reality if you're using anything newish, at least that's been my experience so far, especially in javascript realm. Most fixes I've used for even something like a weird issue or question with my editor, VSCode, has been found/answered by the documentation on github and more often than not by searching issues on github. Github issues definitely seems more useful to me at this point than stackoverflow.

I'm still kind of a noob myself, but I find it interesting he asked you about mixins. My understanding is that they haven't been common to use with React in years (long before I started learning the library) and have been replaced by hooks. Higher order components (again as I understand it) aren't as common these days because they've been largely replaced by hooks as well. Speaking of which, it's interesting that they didn't ask you about hooks at all.  It seems like their React questions are a couple years out of date.  
I was also surprised they didn't ask about hooks. I was ready to talk about them.   The company has been around for a while (>10 years), so they probably have some older code.

I would definitely read up on arrow functions. They are a life saver.  
I would definitely read up on arrow functions. They are a life saver.  
I'm still learning, so I want to make sure I'm correct. Aren't arrow functions special because they don't get read when the js file loads. I think its called being hoisted. Declared functions can appear anywhere in the document and be called. Arrow functions can not. Is that the answer an interviewer would be looking for?  
Aside from the syntax and stuff like implicit return, the biggest advantage of arrow functions is that they do not have their own this. If you use this inside an arrow function it will use the value of this from the closest outside context (i think). Regular functions have their own this which is dynamic. This means that using this inside of an arrow function will usually behave the way you think it would as opposed to a normal function, which will sometimes not. The situation in which this comes up this most is when you use give a method that uses this to a callback function. With a regular function you'll need to bind the this to the object for it to work. You don't have to worry about that with arrow functions.

1a: var, let, const? var is hoisted, let can be reassigned, const cannot. b: I don't know what they mean by this question -- what kind of object? c: typeof d: == uses type coercion e: arrow functions inherit their this from the enclosing scope f: callbacks are functions you pass along to run at some later stage/state/event. 2a: types b: the transpilation step can be a bother, I guess? c: private can only be accessed by the containing class (ish), public not so 3a: I don't know, why do you? b: fuck me if I know, modular design and reusability I guess? c: It's syntactic sugar over a javascript function that will return HTML It's syntactic sugar over a call to React.createElement d: props are immutable, state is not e: it's in the name f: it's in the name g: it's a library to handle routes in react h: Expand on the question, please. What kind of events are we talking about? i: a HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. j: no idea k: It's a variation of the flux pattern; immutable state, to change state you dispatch actions which you catch in reducers to derive the new state. 4a: Ugh. This is too open-ended to bother with, but if you think you're going to need NoSQL, you probably don't. Almost all data has some kind of relationship to other data in your application, so use a regular SQL database. I'm a fan of redis, though -- that's a nice piece of engineering.

Just some notes to add: 1a: var, let, and const are all hoisted (I think functions are also, generally, hoisted). But var has a default value of undefined, whereas let and const do not. This is why a var can be used before explicitly initializing it, but let and const cannot - that is to say, let and const MUST have an explicit initialization where var already has one (undefined) when it is declared. 1f: A callback is a function that is passed as a parameter of a function which is run within that function. 2a: TS also supports interfaces, where JS does not. 4a: I think you're right with that (too vague a question). I think though, the buzzwords they're looking for includes the VERY high-level overview of the difference between SQL and no-SQL.

I (self-taught) had my first-ever interview for a web dev job yesterday. Here is what the interview was like and the questions I was asked. [Long]
For anyone interested in the answers, here you go:  What are the different types of variables in JS? How are they different from each other?   I`ll be honest, I don`t get the question here. Some interpretations are given below In how many ways you can declare a variable? That`s 3 ways: using const, let and var. The difference is in the scope - const and let are block scoped - same as in C/Java/etc while var has function scope(which means it is hoisted to the top of the function). The second difference is that let and var allow you to change the reference while const doesn`t Another interpretation is reference and value types variables. Another interpretation is that there are 7 types:    number - represent the floating point numbers string - immutable character strings object - composite type undefined - value for variable not found at all symbol - a special type of value that is always unique function - a special type of value that can be called to execute code boolean - true or false   What are some different ways to create an object in JS?   By literally defining the object: const a = {a:1, b:'Hello Mon!'} By using the new keyword to instantiate a class: const map = new Map(); By cloning const a = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)) or const a = structuredClone(a)  How can you get the type of a variable in JS?   You cannot usually get the concrete-most type of the variable, but you can use the typeof operator to know from which of the 7 aformentioned families it belongs. If it belongs in the object familly, you can do further checks with the instanceof operator to know if it is of a certain class.  Can you tell me the difference between == and ===?   One is coerced equality and the other is strict equality. The later compare things as is, without coercion, while the former tries to convert values to the same type and then test equality  Do you know what arrow functions are? How are they different from traditional functions?   Arrow functions do not have the this keyword and cannot be used as constructors.  What can you tell me about 'callbacks?'   A callback is a function that executes when an event happens. For example, when you call me back and say "You passed the interview" I will execute the ()=>console.log('I accept your offer') arrow function   ‚Äã  What are some features of TypeScript that JS doesn't have?   Type annotations, generics, decorators(still a stage 3 proposal).  What are some disadvantages of TypeScript?   It can be overly strict Lots of low level and high level options to configure in the tsconfig.json  Exists only at compile time  What can you tell me about access modifiers?   They are the classic OOP ones: private - accessible only inside the class itself protected - accessible only inside the class itself and from subclasses public - accessible to everyone Bonus points for saying that:   In TS-land they exist only at compile time and will always compile down to public access(as is the default in JS) There are native private access modifiers, but they are declared with a #. Example #IamPrivate = 10     
Continuing here Bear with me here, I am not a React master, but I should be able to answer those too  Why do we say, 'Everything is a component' in React?   This could be a tricky question, because components are not the only React notion, there are also hooks, so no, not everything is a component :))) Can`t give any other interpretation here, sorry  What are some advantages of using React?   Separation of concerns into components  What can you tell me about JSX?   A syntax made to resemble HTML and that gets compiled to javascript at build time.  What's the difference between 'state' and 'props?'   Props are passed from the parent to the child component while state is internal to the component itself. A parent component can pass a prop that can alter the state of the child component.  What is the difference between a 'stateful component' and a 'stateless component?'   A stateful component has an internal state and actively keeps track of it, while a stateless component doesn`t keep track of its own state.  What is the difference between DOM and Virtual DOM in React?   The DOM is the Document Object Model and represents the tree of HTML elements on the page The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the DOM tree that react uses to keep track of what and when to render.  What is React Router, and why would you use it?   You use react router when you want to show the user multiple pages without reloading the application. It allows you to change the URL of the page and change the components based on it.  What are 'events' in React? How are they different from events in JS?   Of the top of my head, no ideea. I found this tho Event Handling in React  What is a 'higher order component?'   A component that wraps another component given as a prop  What are 'mixins' in React?   No ideea. Sorry  Have you used Redux? What can you tell me about it?   A library for global state management. It works like this:   We define a state object We dispatch actions, eventually with props Those actions trigger different reducers that apply changes to the state object We query the state object using selectors For async changes, we use effects.    ‚Äã What can you tell me about different kinds of databases?  There are 7 paradigms of databases, see this video for more info  ‚Äã What experience do you have with backend languages, like Node?  Node is not a BE language, it is a JS runtime that allows you to run JS code even without a browser. This means that you can build CLI utilities using JS Most of the things you already know from Browser JS apply in NodeJS too. It ships it`s own module implementation called CommonJS For web apps, you have Express and Fastify if you want low level control and NestJS if you want a full power BE framework There is no window object in NodeJS

Hey thanks for this! It was really helpful. Can you talk about what the initial phone interview was like and how your resume looked like as a self taught person? Did you list non relevant tech experience on there? What that app the only project you did?  
The initial phone interview was with an HR person. She asked me to confirm my education listed on my resume and to talk a little bit about my projects and current working situation.  She then gave me a bit of background on the company, saying that they're maturing and at the point where they have enough senior devs and are looking to start mentoring and investing in more juniors.   Then she gave a rundown of their full interview process, including the coding test on HackerEarth, the Technical Interview (this one), and then the 'company fit' interview with the execs, which she said was mostly a formality if you get to that point.   My resume includes my 2 most recent jobs (program lead for a language teaching program, and currently a teacher in a different language teaching program), and it includes 2 projects I am currently working on. One is the meal planner mentioned in the post, which is up on my GitHub and hosted live on my website. The other is one that I have the idea for but haven't started yet. I think I know enough about what to do with it that I can talk about it, but I don't actually have anything to show for it yet. It probably shouldn't be on there...   I also listed technologies that I have used, including the ones in this post and some others like Illustrator and Figma. I do have some freelance graphic design experience, but only for people I knew or organizations I was a part of, no cold calling or running a business or anything like that. I did not include those jobs.

Do you find a bachelors in linguistics helps you understand coding concepts, even if it isn‚Äôt related? Linguistic structures are a big concept in both underlying CS ideas in language design and overarching application design like NLP.  
I think it has been helpful in a broad sense. I'm a big grammar nerd, and I like analyzing syntax patterns and stuff like that. I took a logic course where we learned logical expressions and worked on translating natural English sentences into logical ones. That kind of systematic thinking seems to translate well to at least learning language syntax. I had no problem understanding &&, ||, ==, ===, for example. My biggest challenge has been changing the way I think to apply programming tools to create more logically elegant solutions to problems. I can usually hack a something together, but it's usually not clean or nice-looking or optimized.  
Yeah, interestingly, I think becoming a junior programmer means learning to deconstruct what you know of typical language to think and express statements more logically for computers. However, becoming a senior programmer means reconstructing those logical statements to become more expressive for typical language users.  Great code isn‚Äôt filled with advanced logical constructs but one that is easy for people to read, understand and change.  You may enjoy getting into the Ruby language soon, which is my world. It‚Äôs known as a very expressive one that encourages developer ‚Äújoy‚Äù (sometimes with cult like fanaticism). The Ruby community‚Äôs focus on TDD and DSLs make the whole thing an expressive experience; full of tight little functions and custom syntax that encourages readability in English. Especially interesting since it started as a toy language by a Japanese man in the 90s.  https://thoughtbot.com/blog/writing-a-domain-specific-language-in-ruby

This is so useful, can I ask how long you‚Äôve been learning for and where in the world you‚Äôre based? Also how hard was the coding challenge? What type of challenge would you say it was? Thank you for posting this :)  
I'm on the west coast of Canada, and I've been learning part-time for about 2 years. I spent the first year kind of farting around brushing up on HTML and CSS. I got serious last summer when I learned about The Odin Project, from this sub I think, and started diving into JavaScript. I wrote the first version of my main project in March this year, and it took me about 3 weeks (Spring Break + 1 week) of coding 5-8ish hours a day to get it mostly functional. The coding challenges were both multiple choice at the beginning and then one programming question at the end. The multiple choice were a lot of things I didn't know about the C language, SQL queries, common algorithms like finding prime numbers between 1 and 100, and high school math questions. One I remember was something like "If Brad can do a task in 10 days and Kate can do the same task in 15 days, how long will it take them to do it together?" The tests were camera-proctored and tab-switching was monitored to prevent cheating. The coding questions were both variations of sorting challenges. The second one was counting how many times racecars would overtake other cars if each number in array represented a car and its speed. The first one, I can't quite remember, something about finding the 5th largest number in a set, maybe? But it involved sorting. I didn't get it during the test, but some research after the fact made me think that bubble sort was the solution. I learned bubble sort after that and used it in the second challenge a week later and got a better score.  
Just in case anyone wondering, Brad and Kate will complete the task in 6 days: (1/((1/10)+(1/15)))  
Why isn't it simply half of their average?

That seems like a lot of questions for an interview. In my experience this isn't the norm for jr level positions.  
nah, I'm senior and this sounds just about right. asking questions that, honestly, don't have much to do with day-to-day work, but are trying to gauge technical ability. like you literally almost never worry or think about 90%+ of the time how to create an object in JS. doesn't matter that there is more than one way to do it. I'd personally rather know about their troubleshooting ability. Like what's their algorithm for finding/verifying a bug. how to diagnose it etc. where did the data come from, and how does it get set/mutated? where up the stack could this have happened? etc etc. edit: yes I know I said "like" a lot. it's Friday and I'm tired ü•±  
Interesting, I've never seen this many technical questions in an interview for a jr position. I even had some senior interviews that asked for less.  Maybe, it's different by region? I'm not saying it's not the norm, just that it hasn't been the norm for me.  
That seems like a lot of questions for an interview. In my experience this isn't the norm for jr level positions.  
Seems appropriate given OPs background. No formal qualifications or references or real work to speak of. Glad the company is actually trying to hire juniors from non-standard backgrounds. For that, you just have to make sure they actually know how to code and have an interest. And they can admit when they don‚Äôt know instead of lying.  
That seems like a lot of questions for an interview. In my experience this isn't the norm for jr level positions.  
I got the impression that the interviewer didn't really want to be there. He was friendly enough, but I think because junior interviews are probably not what he wanted to be doing, instead of prepping a list of engaging questions based on my resume/github, he mostly winged it with a list of generic questions to just eat up the time. It is a bit of a red flag about the company culture, which is one reason why I'm kind of okay if I don't get this one. It was my first, and I mentally prepared for the rejection already anyway. If I do get it though, I'll have so much to learn and focus on that the company culture will be an after-thought. Edit: I want to clarify that I don't blame or bear any ill will towards the interviewer, and I may have totally misread him. It was hard to tell because his camera wasn't on. I've been in his shoes before (having to hire new teachers), and it's stressful in a different way, especially when you have a bunch of other projects on the go that are demanding your time.

 I have one project to speak of. It's a meal planning web app where you can input recipes, and then add recipes to a meal plan and populate a grocery list from the ingredients of the recipes in your meal plan.   I know of an app that does this, but it can be pretty janky, it's called Paprika 3. Able to scrape recipe ingredients and instructions from (seemingly) any recipe page on the web, and add them to a grocery lists. Something about the latter functionality never worked that well for me so I only use it to store recipes. Keep going with yours, there's nothing like that that actually works well yet!

I am also in JavaScript path of TOP but wanted to get right through react already through udemy. Only reason I haven‚Äôt yet was because a lot of people in TOP community tell me to stick to one thing only first. I admit I‚Äôm a bit slow so I don‚Äôt want to rush through these lessons but I do get stuck on the projects quite a lot lol. Would you say it‚Äôd be okay to try out react through udemy and come back to top later? Im only about to be finished with the todo project of the JavaScript path.
